More specifically, we will be concerned with the description of the size of phytoplanktonic organisms. In a first part, we give some biological indications concerning phytoplankton, then describe the experimental apparatus and finally introduce the mathematical models used for an elementary description of the chemostat. The second and main part of this thesis begins by an introduction to structured population models, with emphasis on cellular division description. Then time discrete models describing in a detailed way cellular division are studied, followed by ordinary differential equations systems verifying the mass conservation principle, and finally by a class of models that do not verify this property. We end this thesis by considering possible applications to other contexts or populations of the type of models developped herein.},

The model, which assumes that vector reproduction can lead to the transmission or loss of resistance (reversion), is analyzed in a particular case with specified forms for the birth and force of infection functions. The vector component can have, in the absence of disease, a coexistence equilibrium where both strains survive. In the case where reversion is possible, this coexistence equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when it exists. This equilibrium is still present in the full vector-host system, leading to a reduction of the associated reproduction number, thereby making elimination of the disease more feasible. When reversion is not possible, there can exist an additional equilibrium with only resistant vectors.},

  Abstract                 = {Background
The anticipated extent of antiviral use during an influenza pandemic can have adverse consequences for the development of drug resistance and rationing of limited stockpiles. The strategic use of drugs is therefore a major public health concern in planning for effective pandemic responses.

Methods
We employed a mathematical model that includes both sensitive and resistant strains of a virus with pandemic potential, and applies antiviral drugs for treatment of clinical infections. Using estimated parameters in the published literature, the model was simulated for various sizes of stockpiles to evaluate the outcome of different antiviral strategies.

Results
We demonstrated that the emergence of highly transmissible resistant strains has no significant impact on the use of available stockpiles if treatment is maintained at low levels or the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is sufficiently high. However, moderate to high treatment levels can result in a more rapid depletion of stockpiles, leading to run-out, by promoting wide-spread drug resistance. We applied an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. Our results show that if high treatment levels are enforced too early during the outbreak, a second wave of infections can potentially occur with a substantially larger magnitude. However, a timely implementation of wide-scale treatment can prevent resistance spread in the population, and minimize the final size of the pandemic.

Conclusion
Our results reveal that conservative treatment levels during the early stages of the outbreak, followed by a timely increase in the scale of drug-use, will offer an effective strategy to manage drug resistance in the population and avoid run-out. For a 1918-like strain, the findings suggest that pandemic plans should consider stockpiling antiviral drugs to cover at least 20% of the population.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic simulations of network models have become the standard approach to studying epidemics. We show that many of the predictions of these models can also be obtained from simple classical deterministic compartmental models. We suggest that simple models may be a better way to plan for a threatening pandemic with location and parameters as yet unknown, reserving more detailed network models for disease outbreaks already underway in localities where the social networks are well identified.
We formulate compartmental models to describe outbreaks of influenza and attempt to manage a disease outbreak by vaccination or antiviral treatment. The models give an important prediction that may not have been noticed in other models, namely that the number of doses of antiviral treatment required is extremely sensitive to the number of initial infectives. This suggests that the actual number of doses needed cannot be estimated with any degree of reliability. The model is applicable to pre-epidemic vaccination, such as annual vaccination programs in anticipation of an �ordinary� influenza outbreak with limited drift, and as a combination of treatment both before and during an epidemic.},

A general form of the vaccine waning function is assumed, and the interplay of this together with the vaccine efficacy and vaccination rates is discussed. The integro-differential system describing the model is studied for a constant vaccine waning rate, in which case it reduces to an ODE system, and for a constant waning period, in which case it reduces to a system of delay differential equations. For some parameter values, the model is shown to exhibit a backward bifurcation, leading to the existence of subthreshold endemic equilibria. Numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the consequence of this bifurcation in terms of epidemic control. The model can alternatively be interpreted as one consisting of two social groups, with education playing the role of vaccination.},

  Abstract                 = {A metapopulation malaria model is proposed using SI and SIRS models for the vectors and hosts, respectively. Recovered hosts are partially immune to the disease and while they cannot directly become infectious again, they can still transmit the parasite to vectors. The basic reproduction number R0 is shown to govern the local stability of the disease free equilibrium but not the global behavior of the system because of the potential occurrence of a backward bifurcation. Using type reproduction numbers, we identify the reservoirs of infection and evaluate the effect of control measures. Applications to the spread to non-endemic areas and the interaction between rural and urban areas are given.},

Using a modified Dulac theorem, we prove that this system has a single equilibrium which attracts all solutions for which the disease is present and the population remains bounded. In the second case, an increase of the number of infectives leads to a mass action term being added to a standard incidence term. We show that this allows a Hopf bifurcation to occur, with periodic orbits being generated when a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium loses stability.},

  Abstract                 = {We derive an alternative expression for a delayed logistic equation, assuming that the rate of change of the population depends on three components: growth, death, and intraspecific competition, with the delay in the growth component. In our formulation, we incorporate the delay in the growth term in a manner consistent with the rate of instantaneous decline in the population given by the model. We provide a complete global analysis, showing that, unlike the dynamics of the classical logistic delay differential equation (DDE) model, no sustained oscillations are possible. Just as for the classical logistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) growth model, all solutions approach a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. However, unlike both the logistic ODE and DDE growth models, the value of this equilibrium depends on all of the parameters, including the delay, and there is a threshold that determines whether the population survives or dies out. In particular, if the delay is too long, the population dies out. When the population survives, i.e., the attracting equilibrium has a positive value, we explore how this value depends on the parameters. When this value is positive, solutions of our DDE model seem to be well approximated by solutions of the logistic ODE growth model with this carrying capacity and an appropriate choice for the intrinsic growth rate that is independent of the initial conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The use of neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) for the treatment of ill individuals has been an important intervention during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. However, the emergence and spread of drug resistance remains a major concern and, therefore, optimizing antiviral strategies is crucial to retain the longterm effectiveness of these pharmaceutical interventions.
METHODS: A dynamic model of disease transmission was developed to investigate optimal scenarios for the use of a secondary drug (eg, zanamivir). Considering both small and large stockpiles, attack rates were projected by simulating the model to identify �tipping points� for switching to zanamivir as resistance to oseltamivir develops.
RESULTS: The use of a limited stockpile of zanamivir can substantially reduce the overall attack rate during pandemic outbreaks. For a reasonably large stockpile of zanamivir, it is optimal to delay the use of this drug for a certain amount of time during which oseltamivir is used as the primary drug. For smaller stockpiles, however, earlier use of zanamivir will be most effective in reducing the overall attack rate. Given a limited stockpile of zanamivir (1.8% in the Canadian plan) without replenishment, and assuming that the fraction of ill individuals being treated is maintained below 60%, the results suggest that zanamivir should be dispensed as the primary drug for thresholds of the cumulative number of oseltamivir resistance below 20%.
INTERPRETATION: Strategic use of a secondary drug becomes crucial for pandemic mitigation if vaccination and other interventions fail to sufficiently reduce disease transmission in the community. These findings highlight the importance of enhanced surveillance and clinical monitoring for rapid identification of resistance emergence and its population incidence, so that optimal timing for adaptation to the use of drugs can be achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective

To evaluate the screening measures that would have been required to assess all travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico by air at the start of the 2009 pandemic.

Methods

Data from flight itineraries for travellers who flew from Mexico were used to estimate the number of international airports where health screening measures would have been needed, and the number of travellers who would have had to be screened, to assess all air travellers who could have transported the H1N1 influenza virus out of Mexico during the initial stages of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic.

Findings

Exit screening at 36 airports in Mexico, or entry screening of travellers arriving on direct flights from Mexico at 82 airports in 26 other countries, would have resulted in the assessment of all air travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico at the start of the pandemic. Entry screening of 116 travellers arriving from Mexico by direct or connecting flights would have been necessary for every one traveller at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09. Screening at just eight airports would have resulted in the assessment of 90% of all air travellers at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09 out of Mexico in the early stages of the pandemic.

Conclusion

During the earliest stages of the A(H1N1) pandemic, most public health benefits potentially attainable through the screening of air travellers could have been achieved by screening travellers at only eight airports.},

  Abstract                 = {Infectious disease surveillance for mass gatherings (MGs) can be directed locally and globally; however, epidemic intelligence from these two levels is not well integrated. Modelling activities related to MGs have historically focused on crowd behaviours around MG focal points and their relation to the safety of attendees. The integration of developments in internet-based global infectious disease surveillance, transportation modelling of populations travelling to and from MGs, mobile phone technology for surveillance during MGs, metapopulation epidemic modelling, and crowd behaviour modelling is important for progress in MG health. Integration of surveillance across geographic frontiers and modelling across scientific specialties could produce the first real-time risk monitoring and assessment platform that could strengthen awareness of global infectious disease threats before, during, and immediately after MGs. An integrated platform of this kind could help identify infectious disease threats of international concern at the earliest stages possible; provide insights into which diseases are most likely to spread into the MG; help with anticipatory surveillance at the MG; enable mathematical modelling to predict the spread of infectious diseases to and from MGs; simulate the effect of public health interventions aimed at different local and global levels; serve as a foundation for scientific research and innovation in MG health; and strengthen engagement between the scientific community and stakeholders at local, national, and global levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Background. Every year millions of pilgrims from around the world gather under extremely crowded conditions in Mecca, Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj. In 2009, the Hajj coincided with influenza season during the midst of an influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. After the Hajj, resource-limited countries with large numbers of traveling pilgrims could be vulnerable, given their limited ability to purchase H1N1 vaccine and capacity to respond to a possible wave of H1N1 introduced via returning pilgrims.
Methods. We studied the worldwide migration of pilgrims traveling to Mecca to perform the Hajj in 2008 using data from the Saudi Ministry of Health and international air traffic departing Saudi Arabia after the 2008 Hajj using worldwide airline ticket sales data. We used gross national income (GNI) per capita as a surrogate marker of a country's ability to mobilize an effective response to H1N1.
Results. In 2008, 2.5 million pilgrims from 140 countries performed the Hajj. Pilgrims (1.7 million) were of international (non-Saudi) origin, of which 91.0% traveled to Saudi Arabia via commercial flights. International pilgrims (11.3%) originated from low-income countries, with the greatest numbers traveling from Bangladesh (50,419), Afghanistan (32,621), and Yemen (28,018).
Conclusions. Nearly 200,000 pilgrims that performed the Hajj in 2008 originated from the world's most resource-limited countries, where access to H1N1 vaccine and capacity to detect and respond to H1N1 in returning pilgrims are extremely limited. International efforts may be needed to assist resource-limited countries that are vulnerable to the impact of H1N1 during the 2009 to 2010 influenza season.},

An analysis is conducted, showing that the system has a unique, globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. By means of sensitivity analysis, the influence of parameters on the system is studied. It is shown that, in agreement with biological observations, posttranslational modifications of intermediate filament proteins resulting in filament solubilization are the main regulators of the intermediate filament organization. A high signalling-dependent solubilization of filaments favours the intermediate filament aggregation in particles.},
