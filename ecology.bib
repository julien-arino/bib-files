  abstract	= {In this paper, we present an introduction to primate
		  biogeography at a continental level and then review the
		  literature as it pertains to primate studies. Primate
		  species diversity is highest in the Neotropics and Asia.
		  Most primates range into rain/humid forests in Africa,
		  Asia, and the Neotropics. Asia contains the highest total
		  number of primate species (N = 38) that are considered to
		  require conservation attention, followed closely by the
		  Neotropics (N = 33 species). These biogeographic patterns
		  reflect complex phylogenetic, geologic, and ecological
		  processes. The various biogeographic theories and models
		  used to explain these patterns can be organized into
		  several broad categories (1) descriptive studies, (2)
		  comparative-quantitative approaches, (3) refugia theory,
		  (4) phylogenetic approaches, (5) community ecology, and (6)
		  conservation biology. Descriptive models have been derived
		  from distribution data obtained during collecting
		  expeditions. These models focused on geographic variations
		  in species characteristics and barriers to dispersal (e.g.,
		  Glogerâ€™s Rule, Bergmannâ€™s Rule,
		  Allenâ€™s Rule, river barrier hypothesis). With the
		  advent of digitized statistical procedures, these barriers
		  became testable biogeographic hypotheses using
		  comparative-quantitative models. Thus, many researchers
		  have noted the importance of rivers as geographical
		  subdivisions of populations of a species.
		  Comparative-quantitative models have also involved studies
		  of species-area and distribution-abundance relationships.
		  Generally, larger areas are more species rich and widely
		  distributed primates tend to exist at higher densities.
		  Many researchers have also investigated various ecological
		  correlates (e.g., rainfall, latitude) to patterns of
		  primate species richness. There has been considerable
		  debate regarding the importance of Pleistocene Refugia for
		  understanding the historical biogeography of primates.
		  Phylogenetic or cladistic biogeography focuses on shared
		  derived characters, which can be used to reconstruct
		  biogeographical history. The presence or absence of species
		  within a geographic area has been investigated extensively
		  through studies of community ecology. Similarities between
		  primate communities are most likely if they share a common
		  biogeographic history. Composition of primate communities
		  can also reflect evolutionary niche dynamics. Finally,
		  researchers studying primate conservation biology have
		  synthesized methods from various biogeographic models to
		  understand and predict primate rarity and extinction
		  events. Much of the renewed interest in primate
		  biogeography tends to focus on the spatial and temporal
		  patterns that influence species origins and diversity.},

  abstract = {Finite volume ocean circulation and particle tracking models are used to simulate water-borne transmission of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) among Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farms in the Discovery Islands region of British Columbia, Canada. Historical simulations for April and July 2010 are carried out to demonstrate the seasonal impact of river discharge, wind, ultra-violet (UV) radiation, and heat flux conditions on near-surface currents, viral dispersion and survival. Numerical particles released from infected farm fish in accordance with IHNV shedding rates estimated through laboratory experiments are dispersed by model oceanic flows. Viral particles are inactivated by ambient UV radiation levels and by the natural microbial community at rates derived through laboratory studies. Viral concentration maps showing temporal and spatial changes are produced and combined with lab-determined minimum infectious dosages to estimate the infective connectivity among farms. Results demonstrate that neighbouring naïve farms can become exposed to IHNV via water-borne transport from an IHNV diseased farm, with a higher risk in April than July, and that many events in the sequence of farm outbreaks in 2001-2002 are consistent with higher risks in our farm connectivity matrix. Applications to other diseases, transfers between farmed and wild fish, and the effect of vaccinations are also discussed.},

  title    = {British Columbia: Diagnosis of sturgeon iridovirus infection in farmed white sturgeon in British Columbia},
  year     = {2003},
  abstract = {White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) are 1 of 5 Canadian species of sturgeon and are considered among the largest freshwater fish in North America. These fish range from the Aleutian islands in Alaska to Monterey Bay, California. Although white sturgeon most commonly inhabit freshwater environments, this species is anadromous and has been reported in coastal foreshores of British Columbia. White sturgeon have been recorded in the Fraser River system, the Taku River, the Skeena River, the Columbia River above Revelstoke, Duncan Lake on Vancouver Island, and, possibly, Okanagan Lake (1). 
 
As an alternative to the harvest of wild fish and to attempt enhancement of this species, aquaculture facilities were established to propagate captive stocks of white sturgeon for value added market products (table food market, comprised of steaks weighing between 2 and 3 kg and caviar), fingerling supply, and the aquarium pet trade. In British Columbia, there are currently 3 white sturgeon culture facilities with captive stock derived from the Fraser River system. The first attempt at artificial spawning in British Columbia occurred in 1991, with limited success. Artificial spawnings in 2000 and 2001 each produced between 50 to 80 000 eggs, thus enabling initial captive rearing of juveniles. Although domestic juveniles, fertilized eggs, and fry had been transported from one facility to the other two, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no importation of white sturgeon from sources outside the province (D. Kieser, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, personal communication). 
 
In the fall of 2001, in 1 aquaculture facility, fingerling white sturgeon from the 2001 spawn exhibited chronic inappetence, lethargy, and listlessness. Representative moribund and freshly dead fish between 8 and 10 cm in total length were presented to the Animal Health Centre, Abbotsford, British Columbia for diagnostic evaluation. The fish were maintained in 4, 1.3 m3 circular fiberglass tanks, supplied with mechanically and biologically filtered and ozonated recirculated water from a 600 m3 fresh water recirculation culture system. Effluent water from these tanks was not returned to the recirculation system. Culture fish were fed to satiation with a commercial diet. On initial presentation, moribund fish were dispatched by an overdose of tricaine methanesulfonate (500 mg/L); swabs of the kidney, spleen, and liver were collected and plated on tripticase soy and Cytophaga agars for bacterial culture. Gross and cytologic examination of gill wet mounts and skin scrapes were unremarkable, and bacterial culture yielded scant growth of Aeromonas hydrophila. Representative fish were fixed in Davidson's solution for 48 to 72 h; then, sagittal sections of the head and coelomic cavity were prepared for histologic examination. 
 
Microscopic examination disclosed consistent lesions within virtually all of the examined fish. Throughout the epidermis of the cranium, as well as within the gills, oropharygnx, and, to a much lesser extent, nasal pit, there were variable numbers of solitary to small clusters of Malpighian and mucosal cells, respectively, that were moderately to markedly enlarged and featured abundant amounts of densely basophilic, finely granular to homogeneous cytoplasm (Figure 1). The adjoining epithelial cells were compressed and featured occasional hyperplasia, dysplasia, and scattered karyorrhectic debris. There were no other significant or consistent lesions within the remaining tissues.

Paraffin embedded blocks were processed for electron microscopy by conventional techniques; ultrastructural examination revealed numerous virions within hypertrophic integumentary and mucosal epithelia (Figure 2). The measurements were as follows: outer capsid vertex to vertex = 305 nm; outer capsid side to side = 261 nm; inner capsid vertex to vertex = 209 nm; and inner capsid side to side = 192 nm.

Based on the clinical history and the histologic and ultrastructural features of the affected fish, a diagnosis of white sturgeon iridovirus (WSIV) was adduced. This condition was originally reported in farmed white sturgeon stocks in California (3) and the virus was subsequently detected in production facilities situated in Idaho and Oregon, (4). Although epizootics involving cultured white sturgeon have resulted in up to 95% mortality of 200 000 fish (3), infections, as in this case, are typically more protracted and result in a chronic, debilitating condition, characterized by suboptimal growth performance and reduced survival of fry and fingerlings (5). Adults appear refractory to clinical disease and are likely subclinical carriers with intermittent viral shedding (4). 
 
White sturgeon iridovirus is considered enzootic within wild white sturgeon stocks in the Sacramento- San Joaquin, Columbia, Snake, and Kootenai River systems; introduction of the virus into production facilities has been attributed to inadvertent selection of carrier fish, when obtaining brood or seed stock; vertical transmission associated with contaminated ova; or horizontal dissemination by influent water to hatchery facilities (4). In this case, as, purportedly, no fish have been imported from the USA and culture facilities are geographically remote to the Fraser Valley, infection was likely derived from sturgeon, or their progeny, obtained originally from the Fraser river system. 
 
Currently, there are no treatments available for WSIV, and research efforts have focused on the development of sensitive diagnostic techniques, as well as the epizootiology of the disease, to establish control and preventative measures to minimize the impact of the disease. In a recent investigation into risk factors associated with WSIV infection (5), brood stock selection, particularly in enzootic regions, improved growth performance and the survival of progeny. Measures to reduce site viral exposure, such as by increased water flows and disinfection of fomites, as well as implementation of an all in, all out management scheme and minimization of stress in subyearling stock, significantly reduce the risk of subsequent infections (5). 
 
Detection of this condition in British Columbia expands the geographic distribution of this virus in North American farmed stocks and suggests possible infection of wild sturgeon within the Fraser River system. As the Kootenai River system extends into southwest Alberta, there is a possibility of more widespread infection of wild white sturgeons stocks within Canada than is currently appreciated, and efforts to further characterize the distribution of this pathogen are recommended.},

  abstract = {Cell culture and molecular assays are used for the detection and identification of fish viruses. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is considered to be one of the most important viral pathogens of finfish and is listed as reportable by many nations and international organizations (Office International des Epizooties 2006). Prior to 1988, VHSV was thought to be limited to Europe (Wolf 1988; Smail 1999). Subsequently, it was shown that the virus is endemic among many marine and anadromous fish species in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Meyers and Winton 1995; Skall et al. 2005). Genetic analysis reveals that isolates of VHSV can be divided into four genotypes that generally correlate with geographic location with the North American isolates generally falling into VHSV Genotype IV (Snow et al. 2004). In 2005-2006, reports from the Great Lakes region indicated that wild fish had experienced disease or, in some cases, very large die-offs from VHSV (Elsayed et al. 2006, Lumsden et al. 2007). The new strain from the Great Lakes, now identified as VHSV Genotype IVb, appears most closely related to isolates of VHSV from mortalities that occurred during 2000-2004 in rivers and near-shore areas of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada (Gagne et al. 2007). The type IVb isolate found in the Great Lakes region is the only strain outside of Europe that has been associated with significant mortality in freshwater species.},

  year     = {2018},
  abstract = {Infectious diseases may contribute to declines in Fraser River Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocks, but a clear knowledge gap exists around which infectious agents and diseases are important. This study was conducted to: (1) determine the presence and prevalence of 46 infectious agents in juvenile Fraser River Sockeye salmon, and (2) evaluate spatial patterns in prevalence and burden over initial seaward migration, contrasting patterns between 2 years of average and poor productivity. In total, 2,006 out-migrating Sockeye salmon were collected from four regions along their migration trajectory in British Columbia, in 2012 and 2013. High-throughput microfluidics quantitative PCR was employed for simultaneous quantitation of 46 different infectious agents. Twenty-six agents were detected at least once, including nine with prevalence >5%. Candidatus Brachiomonas cysticola, Myxobolus arcticus, and Pacific salmon parvovirus were the most prevalent agents. Infectious agent diversity and burden increased consistently upon smolts entry into the ocean, but they did not substantially change afterwards. Notably, both freshwater- and saltwater-transmitted agents were more prevalent in 2013 than in 2012, leading to an overall higher infection burden in the first two sampling regions. A reduction in the prevalence of two agents, erythrocytic necrosis virus and Paraneuclospora theridion, was observed between regions 2 and 3, which was speculated to be associated with mortality during the 1st month at sea. The most prevalent infectious agents were all naturally occurring. In a small number of samples (0.9%), seven agents were only detected around and after salmon farming regions, including four important pathogens: piscine orthoreovirus, Piscirickettsia salmonis, Tenacibaculum maritimum, and Moritella viscosa. As the first synoptic survey of infectious agents in juvenile Sockeye salmon in British Columbia, this study provides the necessary baseline for further research on the most prevalent infectious agents and their potential pathogenicity, which may adversely affect the productivity of valuable Sockeye salmon stocks. In addition, our findings are informative to the decision makers involved in conservation programs.},

  abstract = {This study provides an improved statistical modelling framework for understanding historical variability and trends in water constituent fluxes in subarctic western Canada. We evaluated total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes for the Hay, Liard and Peel tributaries of the Mackenzie River. The TP and DOC concentrations primarily exhibit chemodynamic relationships with discharge, with the exception of the chemostatic relationship between DOC and discharge for the Hay River. With this understanding, we explored a number of enhancements in the load estimation model that included the use of (i) linear regression and logarithmic models, (ii) air-temperature as an alternate input variable and (iii) quantile mapping for bias-correction. Further, we evaluated uncertainties in the simulation of fluxes and trends by using a bootstrapping method. The modelled TP and DOC fluxes show considerable seasonal and interannual variability that generally follow the runoff dynamics. The annual and seasonal trends are mostly small and insignificant, with the largest significant increases occurring in the winter months. These trends are amplified compared with discharge, suggesting the possibility of pronounced changes with large changes in discharge. Additionally, the results provide evidence that directly using limited water constituent samples for trend analysis can be problematic.},

The ice-push features were: boulder pavements with tightly embedded boulders; loose boulder pavements with the rocks resting on a bouldery matrix; loose boulders; ice-push island buttresses; and rhythmically spaced boulder ridges. The stability of a feature is directly correlated with the embedment depth of the boulders, for the deeper the burial the more stable the boulder. Boulder pavements, the most stable feature, may persist for decades, if not centuries. The overriding action of rock shod river ice tends to align the boulders with their long axes parallel to the river bank, to size sort the pavement boulders so that the sizes decrease downstream, and to abrade and striate the pavement surface.

  abstract = {Canada’s Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) is one of the largest relatively pristine ecosystems in North America. Home to indigenous peoples for millennia, the basin is also the site of increasing resource development, notably fossil fuels, hydroelectric power resources, minerals, and forests. Three provinces, three territories, the Canadian federal government, and Aboriginal governments (under Canada’s constitution, indigenous peoples are referred to as “Aboriginal”) have responsibilities for water in the basin, making the MRB a significant setting for cooperative, transboundary water governance. A framework agreement that provides broad principles and establishes a river basin organization, the MRB Board, has been in place since 1997. However, significant progress on completing bilateral agreements under the 1997 Mackenzie River Basin Transboundary Waters Master Agreement has only occurred since 2010. We considered the performance of the MRB Board relative to its coordination function, accountability, legitimacy, and overall environmental effectiveness. This allowed us to address the extent to which governance based on river basin boundaries, a bioregional approach, could contribute to adaptive governance in the MRB. Insights were based on analysis of key documents and published studies, 19 key informant interviews, and additional interactions with parties involved in basin governance. We found that the MRB Board’s composition, its lack of funding and staffing, and the unwillingness of the governments to empower it to play the role envisioned in the Master Agreement mean that as constituted, the board faces challenges in implementing a basin-wide vision. This appears to be by design. The MRB governments have instead used the bilateral agreements under the Master Agreement as the primary mechanism through which transboundary governance will occur. A commitment to coordinating across the bilateral agreements is needed to enhance the prospects for adaptive governance in the basin.},

  abstract = {Preliminary evidence suggests that Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from the Yukon River may be more susceptible to Ichthyophonus sp. infections than Chinook from stocks further south. To investigate this hypothesis in a controlled environment, we experimentally challenged juvenile Chinook from the Yukon River and from the Salish Sea with Ichthyophonus sp. and evaluated mortality, infection prevalence and infection load over time. We found that juvenile Chinook salmon from a Yukon River stock were more susceptible to ichthyophoniasis than were those from a Salish Sea stock. After feeding with tissues from infected Pacific herring Clupea pallasii, Chinook salmon from both stocks became infected. The infection was persistent and progressive in Yukon River stock fish, where infections sometimes progressed to mortality, and histological examinations revealed parasite dissemination and proliferation throughout the host tissues. In Salish Sea-origin fish, however, infections were largely transient; host mortalities were rare, and parasite stages were largely cleared from most tissues after 3-4 wk. Susceptibility differences were evidenced by greater cumulative mortality, infection prevalence, parasite density, proportion of fish demonstrating a cellular response, and intensity of the cellular response among fish from the Yukon River stock. These observed differences between Chinook salmon stocks were consistent when parasite exposures occurred in both freshwater and seawater. These results support the hypothesis that a longer-standing host-pathogen relationship, resulting in decreased disease susceptibility, exists among Salish Sea Chinook salmon than among Yukon River conspecifics.},

  abstract = {Inconnu ( Stenodus leucichthys ) stocks of the Mackenzie River drainage exhibit complex life histories. In a single stock, some fish may make occasional or regular movements between freshwater and marine environments while others lead a completely freshwater existence. Many inconnu migrate between the Mackenzie River system and the Beaufort Sea, but during spawning migrations, most are believed to move only as far south as the Rampart Rapids near the community of Fort Good Hope. However, an inconnu tagged in the Liard River in northern British Columbia in 2001 was recaptured near Inuvik (Northwest Territories) in 2002, and a second inconnu tagged in the Liard River in 2002 was recaptured near Tuktoyaktuk (Northwest Territories) in 2003. These two fish exhibited some of the longest freshwater migrations by a species from Canadian waters other than Pacific salmon. Otolith strontium distributions of these two fish confirmed migrations of close to 1800 km between fresh and marine waters and indicated different life histories. Additional inconnu tagged in the Liard River in 2002 were recaptured in or near Great Slave Lake in 2002 and 2003. The movements of all these fish suggest that the management of inconnu stocks will be far more complicated than previously thought: they point out the need for management plans and protection that incorporate large geographic areas.},

Salmon harvests voluntarily reported through the Pacific Salmon Collection Program (PSCP) suggest recent increases in both the abundance and distribution of Pacific salmon in the Arctic over the past decade. In the Canadian western Arctic, chum salmon have been harvested annually since 1997 and more abundant harvests appear to have increased in frequency. Pink salmon harvest has increased from the sporadic catch of individual fish prior to 2003 to 41 pink salmon reported in 2004, 18 reported in 2008, three reported in 2011, and eight reported in 2012 (i.e., predominantly in even-numbered years). Recent reports 0142 Dunmall et al.—Pacific Salmon in the Arctic also expand the known distribution of this species upstream in the Mackenzie River, eastward in the Beaufort Sea and one putative pink salmon was recorded off the east coast of Greenland. Since 2003, one kokanee, one coho, seven Chinook, and ten sockeye salmon have also been reported in the Mackenzie River watershed. Multiple fish identified by local subsistence harvesters as “unusual” were captured near Arctic Bay, Nunavut, in 2011 and 2012. Although abundance and distribution data obtained from voluntary harvest reports need to be interpreted with caution, Pacific salmon may be following thermally suitable habitat northward and benefiting from increased productivity in the Arctic. Reduced sea ice extent and longer durations of open water in the Arctic may also facilitate expanded marine migrations of juvenile and adult salmon. Efforts to document the harvest of Pacific salmon will continue. Pacific salmon may be demonstrating new marine pathways that facilitate the expansion of other similarly opportunistic species and, as such, may be harbingers highlighting major arctic changes.},

  abstract = {This research provides a new method to identify likely marine feeding grounds for migratory pelagic species that are problematic to directly study at sea. The method is based on stable isotope compositions of tissues that may be sampled without harming the target animals, and can be conducted retrospectively from tissue archives. The wild Atlantic salmon has been in steep decline throughout its native range over the past four decades, largely due to increases in marine mortality. This research investigated potential causes of this decline using stable isotope analysis of archived scale samples, taken from returning adult salmon over the past few decades. Investigations of UK scale holdings identified the River Frome and Northeast Coast Driftnet Fishery archives as the most available and useful, giving good spatial contrast and temporal coverage. After developing sampling and analytical protocols, carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition was measured in grilse (one-sea winter) and multi-sea winter (MSW) salmon scale samples taken from both archives over 23 and 14 years. Analyses were performed on the last marine growth season, giving a retrospective record of marine conditions experienced by each fish. Both isotopes are influenced by baseline environmental conditions, and climatic effects are found to exert strong controls on numbers of fish returning to both the Northeast Coast and River Frome populations. Trophic level and/or baseline nitrate effects are also found to influence returning abundance to these populations, although more strongly in the Frome. Yearly d13C values were correlated with median yearly sea surface temperature values for each degree of latitude and longitude across the North Atlantic, and maps produced of the correlation strengths. These maps suggest likely feeding grounds for each cohort within each population, with the River Frome grilse and MSW salmon respectively feeding near the shelf breaks of northeast and southwest Iceland. The Northeast Coast grilse and MSW salmon were, in contrast, feeding near the shelf breaks of the southern Norwegian Sea and the Bear Island Trench in the northern Norwegian Sea, respectively.},

  abstract = {We developed an individual‐based model (IBM) to understand the effects of hydropeaking on growth, survival and distribution of age 0+ to 1+ juveniles for high‐conservation value populations of native brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Atlantic salmon (S. salar) in river Gullspång, Sweden. We parameterized and applied inSTREAM (7.2‐SD) and calibrated the model by comparing predicted versus observed growth under the current hydropeaking regime (n=>1,200 model fish for 365 days). Our objective was to model growth, survival and distribution under flow scenarios with and without hydropeaking. We observed that hydropeaking generally resulted in modest (~10%) negative effects on growth and survival of both species. Survival was more affected than was growth, smaller fish more affected than larger fish. On‐peak (high) hydropeaking flows resulted in less profitable feeding conditions (less growth) and higher predation (lower survival). Thus, inSTREAM 7.2‐SD appears to capture ecologically‐relevant behavioral patterns under hydropeaking, for example, habitat selection, in response to rapid flow changes. Understanding such patterns for large rivers via manipulative field studies, even if possible, would be time‐consuming and costly. Our study demonstrates the potential of IBMs as powerful tools for testing research questions and assessing and prioritizing alternative management strategies in regulated rivers.},

  abstract = {The presence of bull trout ( Salvelinus confluentus ) is reported from four locations in the Sahtu Settlement Area of the Northwest Territories centered about 64°30'N and 125°00'W. These reports extend the geographical range of this species approximately 500 km north of the previous northernmost published localities in the southern Northwest Territories (~61°N, 125°W, Prairie Creek, Liard River drainage). The identity of these char is confirmed using quantitative criteria in a linear discriminant function from the literature shown to be 100% effective in distinguishing bull trout from Dolly Varden ( S. malma ). Regular captures of these fish at one location over several years indicate that these records likely represent established populations and not extralimital occurrences. We hypothesize that bull trout are more extensively distributed in high-gradient streams and rivers of the south-central Mackenzie River valley and likely also occur north of this area. Only limited scientific work has been done in the area, and data on taxonomy and distributions of species are generally lacking. In much of the previous literature, reports of char (other than lake trout, S . namaycush ) have identified the fish as Dolly Varden or arctic char ( S. alpinus ). These identifications are suspect, and care must be taken when interpreting such literature. The presence and vulnerability of bull trout present significant challenges for their conservation and management in this area.},

  year     = {2021},
  abstract = {Variations in water levels of seasonally ice-covered subarctic lakes are indicators of environmental and climatic change. Satellite altimetry enables remote sensing of these lakes, but the lake phenology is problematic as radar reflection surfaces include water, snow, and ice. Reflection from multiple surfaces gives rise to two-peak waveforms across ice-covered lakes. Misinterpretation of the altimetric height has caused extracted water levels to be low compared with gauge data. In this study, a modified retracker is used to determine heights from the first altimetric subwaveform. Using in situ snow depth and ice thickness, the first reflection surface is shown to correspond closely to the snow/ice interface when the lake is frozen. The modified retracker is applied to the Great Bear Lake (GBL), Great Slave Lake (GSL), and Lake Athabasca (ATL) of the Mackenzie River Basin for the period 1992–2020. Standard deviations (Std) of differences between lake levels from Jason-2 waveforms and in situ data across GBL and GSL are 0.06 m with the new methodology compared with 0.11 and 0.08 m, respectively, using the standard Ice retracker. With an Std of 0.11 m between altimetric and gauge lake levels, TOPEX/Poseidon is less accurate than the combined Jason missions (Std: 0.07 m).},

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {Mariners navigating within Canadian waters rely on Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) navigational charts to safely reach their destinations. To fulfil this need, CHS charts must accurately reflect the current state of Canadian coastal regions. While many coastal regions are stable, others are dynamic and require frequent updates. In order to ensure that important and potentially dangerous changes are reflected in CHS products, the organization, in partnership with the Canadian Space Agency, is exploring coastal change detection through satellite remote sensing (SRS). In this work, CHS examined a hybrid shoreline extraction approach which uses both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data. The approach was applied for a section of the Mackenzie River, one of Canada’s most dynamic river systems. The approach used RADARSAT-2 imagery as its primary information source, due to its high positioning accuracy (5 m horizontal accuracy) and ability to allow for low and high water line charting. Landsat represented the primary optical data source due to its long historical record of Earth observation data. Additional sensors, such as Sentinel-2 and WorldView, were also used where a higher resolution was required. The shoreline extraction process is based on an image segmentation approach that uses both the radar and optical data. Critical information was collected using the automated approach to support chart updates, resulting in reductions to the financial, human and time factors present within the ship-based hydrographic survey techniques traditionally used for chart improvements. The results demonstrate the potential benefit of wide area SRS change detection within dynamic waterways for navigational chart improvements. The work also demonstrates that the approach developed for RADARSAT-2 could be implemented with data from the forthcoming RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), which is critical to ensure project continuity.},

  abstract  = {The Mackenzie River, Canada's longest and largest river system, provides the greatest Western Hemisphere discharge to the Arctic Ocean. Recent reports of declining flows have prompted concern because (1) this influences Arctic Ocean salinity, stratification and polar ice; (2) a major tributary, the Peace River, has large hydroelectric projects, and further dams are proposed; and (3) the system includes the extensive and biodiverse Peace–Athabasca, Slave and Mackenzie deltas. To assess hydrological trends over the past century that could reflect climate change, we analysed historic patterns of river discharges. We expanded the data series by infilling for short gaps, calculating annual discharges from early summer‐only records (typical r2 > 0.9), coordinating data from sequential hydrometric gauges (requiring r2 > 0.8) and advancing the data to 2013. For trend detection, Pearson correlation provided similar outcomes to non‐parametric Kendall's τ and Spearman's ρ tests. There was no overall pattern for annual flows of the most southerly Athabasca River (1913–2013), while the adjacent, regulated Peace River displayed increasing flows (1916–2013, p < 0.05). These rivers combine to form the Slave River, which did not display an overall trend (1917–2013). The more northerly, free‐flowing Liard River is the largest tributary and displayed increasing annual flows (1944–2013, p < 0.01, ~3.5% per decade) because of increasing winter, spring, and summer flows, and annual maximum and minimum flows also increased. Following from the tributary contributions, the Mackenzie River flows gradually increased (Fort Simpson 1939–2013, p < 0.05, ~1.5% per decade), but the interannual patterns for the Liard and other rivers were correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, complicating the pattern. This conclusion of increasing river flows to the Arctic Ocean contrasts with some prior reports, based on shorter time series. The observed flow increase is consistent with increasing discharges of the large Eurasian Arctic drainages, suggesting a common northern response to climate change. Analyses of historic trends are strengthened with lengthening records, and with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation influence, we recommend century‐long records for northern rivers.

  title    = {High-Resolution Meteorological Forcing Data for Hydrological Modelling and Climate Change Impact Analysis in Mackenzie River Basin},
  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {Abstract. Cold regions hydrology is very sensitive to the impacts of climate warming. Impacts of warming over recent decades in western Canada include glacier retreat, permafrost thaw and changing patterns of precipitation, with increased proportion of winter precipitation falling as rainfall and shorter durations of snowcover, and consequent changes in flow regimes. Future warming is expected to continue these trends. Physically realistic and sophisticated hydrological models driven by reliable climate forcing can provide the capability to assess hydrological responses to climate change. However, the provision of reliable forcing data remains problematic. Hydrological processes in cold regions involve complex phase changes and so are very sensitive to small biases in the driving meteorology, particularly in temperature and precipitation, including precipitation phase. Cold regions often have sparse surface observations, particularly at high elevations that generate a large amount of runoff. This paper aims to provide an improved set of forcing data for large scale hydrological models for climate change impact assessment. The best available gridded data in Canada is from the high resolution forecasts of the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) atmospheric model and outputs of the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) but these datasets have a short historical record. The EU WATCH ERA-Interim reanalysis (WFDEI) has a longer historical record, but has often been found to be biased relative to observations over Canada. The aim of this study, therefore, is to blend the strengths of both datasets (GEM-CaPA and WFDEI) to produce a less-biased long record product (WFDEI-GEM-CaPA) for hydrological modelling and climate change impacts assessment over the Mackenzie River Basin. First, a multivariate generalization of the quantile mapping technique was implemented to bias-correct WFDEI against GEM-CaPA at 3 h × 0.125° resolution during the 2005–2016 overlap period, followed by a hindcast of WFDEI-GEM-CaPA from 1979. The derived WFDEI-GEM-CaPA data are validated against station observations as a preliminary step to assess its added value. This product is then used to bias-correct climate projections from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis Canadian Regional Climate Model (CanRCM4) between 1950–2100 under RCP8.5, and an analysis of the datasets shows the biases in the original WFDEI product have been removed and the climate change signals in CanRCM4 are preserved. The resulting bias-corrected datasets are a consistent set of historical and climate projection data suitable for large-scale modelling and future climate scenario analysis. The final product (WFDEI-GEM-CaPA, 1979–2016) is freely available at the Federated Research Data Repository at http://dx.doi.org/10.20383/101.0111 (Asong et al., 2018) while the original and corrected CanRCM4 data are available at https://doi.org/10.20383/101.0162 (Asong et al., 2019).},

  year     = {2015},
  abstract = {In the Inuvik, NT, upland tundra region, shoreline retrogressive thaw slumps currently occur along 8% of lakes often transports large volumes of inorganic material to adjacent lakes. Large reductions in DOC and colour (i.e. clearer lakes), and 2-10 fold increases in major ion concentrations have already been observed in slump-affected lakes. Using a gradient of slump disturbance, measured as the percent of catchment area disturbed (%CD), we observed significantly higher concentrations of several trace metals in the water column, (e.g. uranium, strontium, and lithium), indicative of thawed permafrost soils. Conversely, lower concentrations of several ubiquitous metals, (Fe, Mn, and Al,) suggest removal via sedimentation of incoming slump material. The removal of organics and particulates from the water column to the sediments due to thaw slump events is also the probable driver for lower nutrients, N and P, leading to significantly lower planktonic Chl-a concentrations by as much as two thirds when comparing the most disturbed lakes to reference lakes. Both phytoplankton and periphyton measurements indicate the greatest reductions in primary productivity in active slump-affected lakes as opposed to stabilized slump-affected lakes. Additionally, we compared our Chl-a and TP results to 10 other studies across Canada, with an emphasis on similar low-Arctic settings, and suggest that slump-affected lakes are hot-zones for ecological change under the context of climate warming. In these already nutrient-poor systems, future climate warming will likely accelerate thaw slumping and further reduce primary productivity in similar tundra systems},

  title    = {Climate Change Impact On Water Balance Components In Arctic River Basins},
  year     = {2023},
  abstract = {Climate change impact on the water balance components (including river runoff, evapotranspiration and precipitation) of five Arctic river basins (the Northern Dvina, Taz, Lena, Indigirka, and MacKenzie), located in different natural conditions, was investigated using a physically-based land surface model SWAP and meteorological projections simulated at half-degree spatial resolution by five Global Climate Models (GCM) for four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios from 2005 to 2100. After the SWAP model calibration and validation, 20 projections of changes in climatic values of the water balance components were obtained for each river basin. The projected changes in climatic river runoff were analyzed with climatic precipitation and evapotranspiration changes. On average, all rivers’ water balance components will increase by the end of the 21st century: precipitation by 12-30%, runoff by 10–30%, and evapotranspiration by 6-47% depending on the river basin. The partitioning of increment in precipitation between runoff and evapotranspiration differs for the selected river basins due to differences in their natural conditions. The Northern Dvina and Taz river runoff will experience the most negligible impact of climate change under the RCP scenarios. This impact will increase towards eastern Siberia and reach a maximum in the Indigirka basin. Analysis of the obtained hydrological projections made it possible to estimate their uncertainties by applying different GCMs and RCP scenarios. On average, the contribution of GCMs to the uncertainty of hydrological projections is nearly twice more significant than the contribution of scenarios in 2006–2036 and decreases over time to 1.1-1.2 in 2068–2099.},

  year     = {2022},
  abstract = {The Mackenzie Delta is an extensive river-mouth depocentre, the second largest delta on the Arctic Ocean, and lies in the zone of continuous permafrost. We report the first measurements of natural consolidation subsidence in a high-latitude delta with ice-bonded sediments. Several years of episodic GPS records on a network of 15 stable monuments throughout the central and outer delta reveal downward motion between 1.5 ± 0.7 and 5.3 ± 1.1 mm/yr relative to a nearby monument on bedrock. Additional shallow subsidence results from loss of near-surface excess ice with deeper seasonal thaw in a warming climate. Isostatic adjustment is a third component of subsidence, captured in the NAD83v70VG crustal velocity model. Sedimentation rates over much of the outer delta are less than the rate of subsidence combined with rising sea level. Scenarios for future inundation are evaluated using interpolated IPCC AR5 projections, NAD83v70VG, and a LiDAR DEM with realistic consolidation, thaw subsidence, and sedimentation rates, on time scales of 40 and 90 years. These reveal increases in area flooded at mean water level from 33% in 2010 to 65% or as much as 85% in 2100, depending on the emissions scenario, driving delta-front retreat and removing a large proportion of avian nesting habitat. The three components of subsidence together increase the relative sea-level rise by a factor of two to eight, depending on the scenario. Consolidation subsidence may also contribute to rising low-flow water levels in the central delta, increasing river-lake connectivity, with negative impacts on aquatic biodiversity and productivity.},
