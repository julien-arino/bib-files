  abstract	= {In this paper, we present an introduction to primate
		  biogeography at a continental level and then review the
		  literature as it pertains to primate studies. Primate
		  species diversity is highest in the Neotropics and Asia.
		  Most primates range into rain/humid forests in Africa,
		  Asia, and the Neotropics. Asia contains the highest total
		  number of primate species (N = 38) that are considered to
		  require conservation attention, followed closely by the
		  Neotropics (N = 33 species). These biogeographic patterns
		  reflect complex phylogenetic, geologic, and ecological
		  processes. The various biogeographic theories and models
		  used to explain these patterns can be organized into
		  several broad categories (1) descriptive studies, (2)
		  comparative-quantitative approaches, (3) refugia theory,
		  (4) phylogenetic approaches, (5) community ecology, and (6)
		  conservation biology. Descriptive models have been derived
		  from distribution data obtained during collecting
		  expeditions. These models focused on geographic variations
		  in species characteristics and barriers to dispersal (e.g.,
		  Glogerâ€™s Rule, Bergmannâ€™s Rule,
		  Allenâ€™s Rule, river barrier hypothesis). With the
		  advent of digitized statistical procedures, these barriers
		  became testable biogeographic hypotheses using
		  comparative-quantitative models. Thus, many researchers
		  have noted the importance of rivers as geographical
		  subdivisions of populations of a species.
		  Comparative-quantitative models have also involved studies
		  of species-area and distribution-abundance relationships.
		  Generally, larger areas are more species rich and widely
		  distributed primates tend to exist at higher densities.
		  Many researchers have also investigated various ecological
		  correlates (e.g., rainfall, latitude) to patterns of
		  primate species richness. There has been considerable
		  debate regarding the importance of Pleistocene Refugia for
		  understanding the historical biogeography of primates.
		  Phylogenetic or cladistic biogeography focuses on shared
		  derived characters, which can be used to reconstruct
		  biogeographical history. The presence or absence of species
		  within a geographic area has been investigated extensively
		  through studies of community ecology. Similarities between
		  primate communities are most likely if they share a common
		  biogeographic history. Composition of primate communities
		  can also reflect evolutionary niche dynamics. Finally,
		  researchers studying primate conservation biology have
		  synthesized methods from various biogeographic models to
		  understand and predict primate rarity and extinction
		  events. Much of the renewed interest in primate
		  biogeography tends to focus on the spatial and temporal
		  patterns that influence species origins and diversity.},
