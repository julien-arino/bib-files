  Abstract                 = {Current drug choices to treat extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) are scarce; therefore, information on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of alternative regimens is of utmost importance. The aim of this study was to describe the management, drug adverse effects and outcome of alternative combined treatment in a series of XDR-TB patients.A retrospective study was performed on 17 non-AIDS, pulmonary adult patients with XDR-TB admitted to a referral treatment centre for infectious diseases in Buenos Aires from 2002 through 2008. Drug susceptibility testing was performed under regular proficiency testing and confirmed at the national TB reference laboratory.Linezolid was included in the drug regimens of all patients; moxifloxacin and/or thioridazine were included in the regimens of 14 patients. Clinically tractable drug adverse effects were observed in nine patients, the most frequent being haematological disorders and neurotoxicity. In two patients, thioridazine was discontinued. Negative culture conversion was achieved in 15 patients, 11 completed treatment meeting cure criteria, 4 are still on follow-up with good evolution, 1 defaulted treatment and 1 was lost to follow-up.The combination of linezolid, moxifloxacin and thioridazine is recommended for compassionate use in specialized centres with expertise in the management of XDR-TB.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of sampling methods are available to recruit drug users and collect HIV risk behavior data. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a modified form of chain-referral sampling with a mathematical system for weighting the sample to compensate for its not having been drawn randomly. It is predicated on the recognition that peers are better able than outreach workers and researchers to locate and recruit other members of a "hidden" population. RDS provides a means of evaluating the reliability of the data obtained and also allows inferences about the characteristics of the population from which the sample is drawn. In this paper we present findings from a pilot study conducted to assess the effectiveness of RDS to recruit a large and diversified group of drug users in New York City. Beginning with eight seeds (i.e., initial recruits) we recruited 618 drug users (injecting and non-injecting) in 13 weeks. The data document both cross-gender and cross-race and -ethnic recruitment as well as recruitment across drug-use status. Sample characteristics are similar to the characteristics of the drug users recruited in other studies conducted in New York City. The findings indicate that RDS is an effective sampling method for recruiting diversified drug users to participate in HIV-related behavioral surveys.},

  Abstract                 = {Two decades ago, WHO declared tuberculosis a global emergency, and invested in the highly cost-effective directly observed treatment short-course programme to control the epidemic. At that time, most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were susceptible to first-line tuberculosis drugs, and drug resistance was not a major issue. However, in 2013, tuberculosis remains a major public health concern worldwide, with prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis rising. WHO estimates roughly 630 000 cases of MDR tuberculosis worldwide, with great variation in the frequency of MDR tuberculosis between countries. In the past 8 years, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis has emerged, and has been reported in 84 countries, heralding the possibility of virtually untreatable tuberculosis. Increased population movement, the continuing HIV pandemic, and the rise in MDR tuberculosis pose formidable challenges to the global control of tuberculosis. We provide an overview of the global burden of drug-resistant disease; discuss the social, health service, management, and control issues that fuel and sustain the epidemic; and suggest specific recommendations for important next steps. Visionary political leadership is needed to curb the rise of MDR and XDR tuberculosis worldwide, through sustained funding and the implementation of global and regional action plans.},

  Abstract                 = {A survey was conducted in 1995 to assess the prevalence of TB infection using the PPD skin test infection among 3931 inmates in all 21 jails in Lebanon. Forty-five percent of participants had a positive PPD skin test. The likelihood of testing positive was higher among men versus women, and among those who had been incarcerated for more than 3 years versus less than that. Compared to prisoners whose usual residence was Central Lebanon, those from North Lebanon and those from outside Lebanon (mostly Syria and Egypt) had a higher risk for PPD positivity, those from Bekaa a lower risk, and those from South Lebanon about the same risk. Among those with positive PPD tests, 7\% had abnormal chest X-rays suggestive of active infection. Results suggest that TB infection is an important health problem in correctional facilities in Lebanon and that special control programs should target North Lebanon. The importance of screening the incarcerated population with chest X-rays rather than PPD skin tests is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Resistance to anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs continues to present a major challenge to global public health. Resistance usually develops due to inadequate TB management, including improper use of medications, improper treatment regimens and failure to complete the treatment course. This may be due to an erratic supply or a lack of access to treatment, as well as to patient noncompliance. However, the emergence and transmission of drug-resistant TB, including the recently detected extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB), is driven, in part, by the synergistic relationship between TB and HIV (TB/HIV coinfection). There is evidence that persons infected with HIV are more likely to experience XDR-TB. XDR-TB is virtually untreatable with available TB medications. XDR-TB presents a grave global public health threat, particularly in high HIV prevalence settings. The present commentary discusses the current status of XDR-TB and draws attention to the urgency in addressing this problem, for both the global and Canadian public health networks. XDR-TB and the apparent XDR-TB and HIV association warrants further study.},

Stewart's quantitative analysis was applied as a complementary approach to determine the relative contributions of several non-respiratory components to the arterial acid-base response. Acute decrease in body temperature (TB) lowered PaCO2 (32.5 to 14.5 mmHg) and [HCO3-]a(24.20 mEq/L to 17.56 mEq/L), increased pHa (7.481 to 7.608) and diminished the [OH-]/[H+] ratio, but had no significant effect on [SID] or [Atot], although both total phosphorus [PT] and inorganic phosphate [Pi] increased. The acid-base changes found were intermediate between those predicted by alpha-stat and pH-stat hypotheses. Deviation from the regulative alpha-imidazole strategy was more apparent in the plasma than in the intraerythrocyte compartment. We conclude that blood pH changes observed were mainly caused by increased relative ventilation (lung ventilation per unit of CO2 removed) and by resulting changes in PCO2, with a minor metabolic component but without significant contribution from ionic shifts or changes in plasma protein concentration.},

  Abstract                 = {For the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB), potent new drugs are urgently needed. Linezolid is a promising drug, but its use is limited by adverse effects with prolonged administration of 600 mg twice daily. In order to reduce its adverse effects and maintain efficacy, we investigated whether linezolid in a reduced dosage resulted in drug serum concentrations exceeding a ratio of the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) over 24 hours (AUC(24)) [AUC(24)/MIC] of >100.This open-label, prospective pharmacokinetic study evaluated two doses (300 and 600 mg) of linezolid in MDR-TB patients, who received linezolid as part of their treatment. They received linezolid 300 mg twice daily for 3 days, followed by 600 mg twice daily. Blood samples taken at predefined intervals for measuring serum linezolid concentrations were processed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry procedure. The AUC(24)/MIC ratio was used as a predictive model of efficacy. Adverse effects of linezolid, including peripheral neuropathy, were evaluated by clinical and laboratory assessments.Eight patients were included in this study. The median duration of linezolid treatment was 56 days (interquartile range [IQR 44-82] days), with a median cumulative dose of 51,000 mg (IQR 33,850-60,450 mg). The median linezolid AUC over 12 hours (AUC(12)) values were 57.6 mg x h/L (IQR 38.5-64.2 mg x h/L) with the 300 mg dose and 145.8 mg x h/L (IQR 101.2-160.9 mg x h/L) with the 600 mg dose. The AUC(24)/MIC ratios were 452 (IQR 343-513) with the 300 mg dose and 1151 (IQR 656-1500) with the 600 mg dose. Linezolid was well tolerated.Seemingly effective serum concentrations were reached after 3 days of administration of linezolid 300 mg twice daily, i.e. the AUC(24)/MIC ratio was at least 100 in 7 of 8 patients. Larger numbers of patients should be studied to confirm the efficacy of the linezolid 300 mg twice-daily dosage in MDR-TB or XDR-TB treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {During the last few years, PCR-based methods have been developed to simplify and reduce the time required for genotyping Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) by standard approaches based on IS6110-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). Of these, MIRU-12-VNTR (Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units- variable number of tandem repeats) (MIRU-12) has been considered a good alternative. Nevertheless, some limitations and discrepancies with RFLP, which are minimized if the technique is complemented with spoligotyping, have been found. Recently, a new version of MIRU-VNTR targeting 15 loci (MIRU-15) has been proposed to improve the MIRU-12 format.We evaluated the new MIRU-15 tool in two different samples. First, we analyzed the same convenience sample that had been used to evaluate MIRU-12 in a previous study, and the new 15-loci version offered higher discriminatory power (Hunter-Gaston discriminatory index [HGDI]: 0.995 vs 0.978; 34.4\% of clustered cases vs 57.5\%) and better correlation (full or high correlation with RFLP for 82\% of the clusters vs 47\%). Second, we evaluated MIRU-15 on a population-based sample and, once again, good correlation with the RFLP clustering data was observed (for 83\% of the RFLP clusters). To understand the meaning of the discrepancies still found between MIRU-15 and RFLP, we analyzed the epidemiological data for the clustered patients. In most cases, splitting of RFLP-clustered patients by MIRU-15 occurred for those without epidemiological links, and RFLP-clustered patients with epidemiological links were also clustered by MIRU-15, suggesting a good epidemiological background for clustering defined by MIRU-15.The data obtained by MIRU-15 suggest that the new design is very efficient at assigning clusters confirmed by epidemiological data. If we add this to the speed with which it provides results, MIRU-15 could be considered a suitable tool for real-time genotyping.},

A retrospective re-view of the clinical and laboratory records of 1,810 suspected cases of TB was carried out between January 2004 and September 2008. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of each Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate were analyzed. During the study period, 312 M. tuberculosis culture confirmed cases were recorded; 230 were males and 82 were females. The majority of TB cases (36\%) were seen among expatriates from South and Southeast Asian countries. Fifty-one active TB cases (16\%) were reported in native people (Emaratis) of the country. The peak age group was between 16 and 45 years. Among first-line antituberculosis drugs, resistance to isoniazid was the most common (21\%), followed by streptomycin (14\%). MDR-TB was found in 15 cases (4.8\%). Although the prevalence of TB in UAE is fairly low, an increasing number of cultures confirmed TB and MDR-TB among native and expatriate patients, necessitating improved vigilance in case detection, effec-tive management and prevention of MDR and XDR-TB emergence in the country.},

  Abstract                 = {Thioridazine (TDZ) in combination with antibiotics to which extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is initially resistant yields a cure. This is due to the fact that TDZ enhances the killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis by non-killing macrophages, inhibits the genetic expression of efflux pumps of M. tuberculosis that extrude antibiotics prior to reaching their intended targets, and inhibits the activity of existing efflux pumps that contribute to the multidrug-resistant phenotype of M. tuberculosis. The combination of these effects of TDZ probably contributes to the successful recent cures of XDR-TB cases when the phenothiazine TDZ is used in combination with antibiotics to which the patient with XDR-TB was initially unresponsive.},

MTBC is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), which remains one of the leading causes of disease and morbidity world-wide. DNA fingerprinting methods such as MIRU are key components of modern TB control and tracking. The BN achieves high accuracy on four large MTBC genotype collections consisting of over 4700 distinct 12-loci MIRU genotypes. The BN captures distinct MIRU signatures associated with each lineage, explaining the excellent performance of the BN. The errors in the BN support the need for additional biomarkers such as the expanded 24-loci MIRU used in CDC genotyping labs since May 2009. The conditional independence assumption of each locus given the lineage makes the BN easily extensible to additional MIRU loci and other biomarkers.},

The role of exogenous reinfection as a cause of MDR and XDR TB in these settings has not been determined.We reviewed data from patients with culture-positive TB who later developed MDR or XDR TB in Tugela Ferry, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa during 2005-2006. We performed spoligotyping on initial isolates (obtained at the time of treatment initiation) and follow-up isolates obtained from these patients.We identified 23 patients who developed MDR or XDR TB after being treated for less resistant TB between June 2005 and June 2006. Both initial and follow-up isolates were available for spoligotyping for 17 of these patients. In all cases, the follow-up isolates' spoligotypes differed from those of the initial isolate, indicating exogenous reinfection. Two genotypes (shared type [ST] 34 and ST 60, associated with MDR and XDR TB, respectively) were responsible for 85\% of reinfections. All 17 patients had been hospitalized; all 15 whose HIV infection status was known were HIV-infected.Exogenous reinfection is an important mechanism for the development of MDR and XDR TB. In addition to strengthening TB treatment programs, effective infection control strategies are urgently needed to reduce the transmission of MDR and XDR TB.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is emerging as a major clinical and public health challenge in areas of sub-Saharan Africa where there is a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. TB drug-resistance surveillance in this region has been limited by laboratory capacity and the public health infrastructure; however, with the maturation of the HIV epidemic, the burden of drug-resistant TB is increasing rapidly. The recent discovery of large numbers of cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB in South Africa likely represents an unrecognized and evolving epidemic rather than sporadic, localized outbreaks. The combination of a large population of HIV-infected susceptible hosts with poor TB treatment success rates, a lack of airborne infection control, limited drug-resistance testing, and an overburdened MDR-TB treatment program provides ideal conditions for an MDR-TB and XDR-TB epidemic of unparalleled magnitude. In the present article, we review the history of drug-resistant TB in South Africa, describe its interaction with the HIV epidemic and the resultant consequences, and suggest measures necessary for controlling MDR-TB and XDR-TB in this context. A successful response to the emergence of MDR-TB and XDR-TB will necessitate increased resources for and collaboration between TB and HIV programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) have emerged in high-HIV-prevalence settings, which generally lack laboratory infrastructure for diagnosing TB drug resistance. Even where available, inherent delays with current drug-susceptibility testing (DST) methods result in clinical deterioration and ongoing transmission of MDR and XDR-TB. Identifying clinical predictors of drug resistance may aid in risk stratification for earlier treatment and infection control.We performed a retrospective case-control study of patients with MDR (cases), XDR (cases) and drug-susceptible (controls) TB in a high-HIV-prevalence setting in South Africa to identify clinical and demographic risk factors for drug-resistant TB. Controls were selected in a 1:1:1 ratio and were not matched. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and performed multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors.We enrolled 116, 123 and 139 patients with drug-susceptible, MDR, and XDR-TB. More than 85\% in all three patient groups were HIV-infected. In multivariate analysis, MDR and XDR-TB were each strongly associated with history of TB treatment failure (adjusted OR 51.7 [CI 6.6-403.7] and 51.5 [CI 6.4-414.0], respectively) and hospitalization more than 14 days (aOR 3.8 [CI 1.1-13.3] and 6.1 [CI 1.8-21.0], respectively). Prior default from TB treatment was not a risk factor for MDR or XDR-TB. HIV was a risk factor for XDR (aOR 8.2, CI 1.3-52.6), but not MDR-TB. Comparing XDR with MDR-TB patients, the only significant risk factor for XDR-TB was HIV infection (aOR 5.3, CI 1.0-27.6).In this high-HIV-prevalence and drug-resistant TB setting, a history of prolonged hospitalization and previous TB treatment failure were strong risk factors for both MDR and XDR-TB. Given high mortality observed among patients with HIV and drug-resistant TB co-infection, previously treated and hospitalized patients should be considered for empiric second-line TB therapy while awaiting confirmatory DST results in settings with a high-burden of MDR/XDR-TB.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the way optimization theory has been used in canopy models to analyse the adaptive significance of photosynthesis-related plant characteristics and their consequences for the structure and species composition of vegetation stands.In most studies simple optimization has been used with trait values optimal when they lead to maximum whole-stand photosynthesis. This approach is subject to the condition that the optimum for one individual is independent of the characteristics of its neighbours. This seems unlikely in vegetation stands where neighbour plants strongly influence each other's light climate. Not surprisingly, there are consistent deviations between predicted plant traits and real values: plants tend to be taller, distribute nitrogen more evenly among their leaves and produce more leaf area which is projected more horizontally than predicted by models.By applying game theory to individual plant-based canopy models, other studies have shown that optimal vegetation stands with maximum whole-stand photosynthesis are not evolutionarily stable. They can be successfully invaded by mutants that are taller, project their leaves more horizontally or that produce greater than optimal leaf areas. While these individual-based models can successfully predict the canopy structure of vegetation stands, they are invariably determined at unique optimal trait values. They do not allow for the co-existence of more than one species with different characteristics. Canopy models can contribute to our understanding of species coexistence through (a) simultaneous analysis of the various traits that determine light capture and photosynthesis and the trade-offs between them, and (b) consideration of trade-offs associated with specialization to different positions in the niche space defined by temporal and spatial heterogeneity of resources.},

  Abstract                 = {A condition is derived for reciprocal altruism to evolve by kin or group selection. It is assumed that many additively acting genes of small effect and the environment determine the probability that an individual is a reciprocal altruist, as opposed to being unconditionally selfish. The particular form of reciprocal altruism considered is TIT FOR TAT, a strategy that involves being altruistic on the first encounter with another individual and doing whatever the other did on the previous encounter in subsequent encounters with the same individual. Encounters are restricted to individuals of the same generation belonging to the same kin or breeding group, but first encounters occur at random within that group. The number of individuals with which an individual interacts is assumed to be the same within any kin or breeding group. There are 1 + i expected encounters between two interacting individuals. On any encounter, it is assumed that an individual who behaves altruistically suffers a cost in personal fitness proportional to c while improving his partner's fitness by the same proportion of b. Then, the condition for kin or group selection to prevail is [Formula: see text] if group size is sufficiently large and the group mean and the within-group genotypic variance of the trait value (i.e., the probability of being a TIT-FOR-TAT strategist) are uncorrelated. Here, C, Vb, and Tb are the population mean, between-group variance, and between-group third central moment of the trait value and r is the correlation between the additive genotypic values of interacting kin or of individuals within the same breeding group. The right-hand side of the above inequality is monotone decreasing in C if we hold Tb/Vb constant, and kin and group selection become superfluous beyond a certain threshold value of C. The effect of finite group size is also considered in a kin-selection model.},

  Abstract                 = {The Styblo model is the result of international collaboration aimed at the expansion of national tuberculosis (TB) programs in partner countries. This model is the foundation of the DOTS strategy launched in the 1990s and which was subsequently expanded as a global strategy. This paper discusses the impact and relevance of this body of work. The basic principles supporting the model still hold. There is a tendency to be all-inclusive when global strategies are devised, which increases the complexity of such strategies. Whereas it is relatively easy to standardize diagnosis and surveillance, this is not the case with patient care and treatment where, as recent experiences in TB programs show, universal recommendations can be controversial. It may be unwise to put forward global strategies when the terrain is as variable as it is in different parts of the world. Since the conception of the model, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic has been gaining force in Africa. As a result, TB control efforts on the continent have been severely undermined. The relevance of the model in this setting is questioned. Although HIV infection has contributed to outbreaks of drug-resistant TB, it has also facilitated the control of outbreaks of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. Where MDR-TB has reached critical proportions in the absence of HIV, it has proven difficult to control. Technological development has not kept up with the need for new tools. Whereas many policy analysts agree that a revised strategy is required, a convincing breakthrough has yet to appear.},

This study aimed to analyse data on antituberculosis drug resistance gathered by the WHO and International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Global Project on Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance.Data on drug susceptibility testing for four antituberculosis drugs--isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and streptomycin--were gathered in the third round of the Global Project (1999-2002) from surveys or ongoing surveillance in 79 countries or geographical settings. These data were combined with those from the first two rounds of the project and analyses were done. Countries that participated followed a standardised set of guidelines to ensure comparability both between and within countries.The median prevalence of resistance to any of the four antituberculosis drugs in new cases of tuberculosis identified in 76 countries or geographical settings was 10.2\% (range 0.0-57.1). The median prevalence of multidrug resistance in new cases was 1.0\% (range 0.0-14.2). Kazakhstan, Tomsk Oblast (Russia), Karakalpakstan (Uzbekistan), Estonia, Israel, the Chinese provinces Liaoning and Henan, Lithuania, and Latvia reported prevalence of multidrug resistance above 6.5\%. Trend analysis showed a significant increase in the prevalence of multidrug resistance in new cases in Tomsk Oblast (p<0.0001). Hong Kong (p=0.01) and the USA (p=0.0002) reported significant decreasing trends in multidrug resistance in new cases of tuberculosis.Multidrug resistance represents a serious challenge for tuberculosis control in countries of the former Soviet Union and in some provinces of China. Gaps in coverage of the Global Project are substantial, and baseline information is urgently required from several countries with high tuberculosis burden to develop appropriate control interventions.},

  Abstract                 = {Infectious diseases are the second leading cause of death worldwide. In order to better understand and treat them, an accurate evaluation using multi-modal imaging techniques for anatomical and functional characterizations is needed. For non-invasive imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), there have been many engineering improvements that have significantly enhanced the resolution and contrast of the images, but there are still insufficient computational algorithms available for researchers to use when accurately quantifying imaging data from anatomical structures and functional biological processes. Since the development of such tools may potentially translate basic research into the clinic, this study focuses on the development of a quantitative and qualitative image analysis platform that provides a computational radiology perspective for pulmonary infections in small animal models. Specifically, we designed (a) a fast and robust automated and semi-automated image analysis platform and a quantification tool that can facilitate accurate diagnostic measurements of pulmonary lesions as well as volumetric measurements of anatomical structures, and incorporated (b) an image registration pipeline to our proposed framework for volumetric comparison of serial scans. This is an important investigational tool for small animal infectious disease models that can help advance researchers' understanding of infectious diseases.We tested the utility of our proposed methodology by using sequentially acquired CT and PET images of rabbit, ferret, and mouse models with respiratory infections of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), H1N1 flu virus, and an aerosolized respiratory pathogen (necrotic TB) for a total of 92, 44, and 24 scans for the respective studies with half of the scans from CT and the other half from PET. Institutional Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care approvals were obtained prior to conducting this research. First, the proposed computational framework registered PET and CT images to provide spatial correspondences between images. Second, the lungs from the CT scans were segmented using an interactive region growing (IRG) segmentation algorithm with mathematical morphology operations to avoid false positive (FP) uptake in PET images. Finally, we segmented significant radiotracer uptake from the PET images in lung regions determined from CT and computed metabolic volumes of the significant uptake. All segmentation processes were compared with expert radiologists' delineations (ground truths). Metabolic and gross volume of lesions were automatically computed with the segmentation processes using PET and CT images, and percentage changes in those volumes over time were calculated. (Continued on next page)(Continued from previous page) Standardized uptake value (SUV) analysis from PET images was conducted as a complementary quantitative metric for disease severity assessment. Thus, severity and extent of pulmonary lesions were examined through both PET and CT images using the aforementioned quantification metrics outputted from the proposed framework.Each animal study was evaluated within the same subject class, and all steps of the proposed methodology were evaluated separately. We quantified the accuracy of the proposed algorithm with respect to the state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. For evaluation of the segmentation results, dice similarity coefficient (DSC) as an overlap measure and Haussdorf distance as a shape dissimilarity measure were used. Significant correlations regarding the estimated lesion volumes were obtained both in CT and PET images with respect to the ground truths (R2=0.8922,p<0.01 and R2=0.8664,p<0.01, respectively). The segmentation accuracy (DSC (\%)) was 93.4±4.5\% for normal lung CT scans and 86.0±7.1\% for pathological lung CT scans. Experiments showed excellent agreements (all above 85\%) with expert evaluations for both structural and functional imaging modalities. Apart from quantitative analysis of each animal, we also qualitatively showed how metabolic volumes were changing over time by examining serial PET/CT scans. Evaluation of the registration processes was based on precisely defined anatomical landmark points by expert clinicians. An average of 2.66, 3.93, and 2.52 mm errors was found in rabbit, ferret, and mouse data (all within the resolution limits), respectively. Quantitative results obtained from the proposed methodology were visually related to the progress and severity of the pulmonary infections as verified by the participating radiologists. Moreover, we demonstrated that lesions due to the infections were metabolically active and appeared multi-focal in nature, and we observed similar patterns in the CT images as well. Consolidation and ground glass opacity were the main abnormal imaging patterns and consistently appeared in all CT images. We also found that the gross and metabolic lesion volume percentage follow the same trend as the SUV-based evaluation in the longitudinal analysis.We explored the feasibility of using PET and CT imaging modalities in three distinct small animal models for two diverse pulmonary infections. We concluded from the clinical findings, derived from the proposed computational pipeline, that PET-CT imaging is an invaluable hybrid modality for tracking pulmonary infections longitudinally in small animals and has great potential to become routinely used in clinics. Our proposed methodology showed that automated computed-aided lesion detection and quantification of pulmonary infections in small animal models are efficient and accurate as compared to the clinical standard of manual and semi-automated approaches. Automated analysis of images in pre-clinical applications can increase the efficiency and quality of pre-clinical findings that ultimately inform downstream experimental design in human clinical studies; this innovation will allow researchers and clinicians to more effectively allocate study resources with respect to research demands without compromising accuracy.},

Two other passengers developed confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 infection, 12 and 48 hours after the flight. They reported no other potential sources of infection. Their seating was within two rows of infected passengers, implying a risk of infection of about 3.5\% for the 57 passengers in those rows. All but one of the confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 infected travellers reported cough, but more complex definitions of influenza cases had relatively low sensitivity. Rigorous follow-up by public health workers located 93\% of passengers, but only 52\% were contacted within 72 hours of arrival.A low but measurable risk of transmission of pandemic A/H1N1 exists during modern commercial air travel. This risk is concentrated close to infected passengers with symptoms. Follow-up and screening of exposed passengers is slow and difficult once they have left the airport.},

  Abstract                 = {Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health emergency. We investigated the characteristics and extent of XDR TB in California to inform public health interventions.XDR TB was defined as TB with resistance to at least isoniazid, rifampin, a fluoroquinolone, and 1 of 3 injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). Pre-XDR TB was defined as TB with resistance to isoniazid and rifampin and either a fluoroquinolone or second-line injectable agent but not both. We analyzed TB case reports submitted to the state TB registry for the period 1993-2006. Local health departments and the state TB laboratory were queried to ensure complete drug susceptibility reporting.Among 424 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases with complete drug susceptibility reporting, 18 (4.2\%) were extensively drug resistant, and 77 (18\%) were pre-extensively drug resistant. The proportion of pre-XDR TB cases increased over time, from 7\% in 1993 to 32\% in 2005 (P = .02)). Among XDR TB cases, 83\% of cases involved foreign-born patients, and 43\% were diagnosed in patients within 6 months after arrival in the United States. Mexico was the most common country of origin. Five cases (29\%) of XDR TB were acquired during therapy in California. All patients with XDR TB had pulmonary disease, and most had prolonged infectious periods; the median time for conversion of sputum culture results was 195 days. Among 17 patients with known outcomes, 7 (41.2\%) completed therapy, 5 (29.4\%) moved, and 5 (29.4\%) died. One patient continues to receive treatment.XDR TB and pre-XDR TB cases comprise a substantial fraction of MDR TB cases in California, indicating the need for interventions that improve surveillance, directly observed therapy, and rapid drug susceptibility testing and reporting.},

  pages       = {55--65},
  volume      = {40},
  abstract    = {Over one-third of the world's population has been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). New drug designs are necessitated by the appearance of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). This work presents four hydrazide compounds that inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth at potency comparable to isoniazid. The hydrazide drugs A, B, C, and D were synthesized utilizing microwave excitation methodologies. Hydrazide agents are produced from parent carboxyl compounds. All reactions were accomplished in dry conditions. Using suitable molecular scaffolds the final hydrazides possessed the desired properties in Log P, polar surface area, molecular weight, etc. All four hydrazide compounds induced at least 60\% inhibition of TB at concentrations at less than 31.5 microgram/mL. Measured as relative survival, all four hydrazide compounds induced greater than 95\% death of TB bacteria at concentrations less than 31.5 microgram/mL. Drugs A, B, C, D exhibited zero violations of the Rule of 5, indicating favorable bioavailability. Although isoniazid, A, B, C, and D were determined to have a polar surface area less than 70 Angstroms2, the values of Log P (a measurement of lipophilicity) showed a broad range of -1.463 (drug C) to 4.46 (drug A). The numerical values of polar surface area suggests that all drugs would have greater than 50\% intestinal absorption. For all drugs the number of amine (-NH) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups remains constant at three, with number of oxygens and nitrogens varying only three to four. ANOSIM (analysis of similarity) indicated that isoniazid, A, B, C, and D are highly similar. Correlation of molecular properties for all five drugs is greater than r = 0.9500. Drugs A, B, C, and D are members of two homologous series of anti-tuberculosis agents. All hydrazides effectively inhibited TB at 31.5 micrograms/mL and lower concentrations.},

  Abstract                 = {Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis has spread among hospitalised patients in South Africa, but the epidemic-level effect of hospital-based infection control strategies remains unknown. We modelled the plausible effect of rapidly available infection control strategies on the overall course of the XDR tuberculosis epidemic in a rural area of South Africa.We investigated the effect of administrative, environmental, and personal infection control measures on the epidemic trajectory of XDR tuberculosis in the rural community of Tugela Ferry. Assessments were done with a mathematical model incorporating over 2 years of longitudinal inpatient and community-based data. The model simulated inpatient airborne tuberculosis transmission, community tuberculosis transmission, and the effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy.If no new interventions are introduced, about 1300 cases of XDR tuberculosis are predicted to occur in the area of Tugela Ferry by the end of 2012, more than half of which are likely to be nosocomially transmitted. Mask use alone would avert fewer than 10\% of cases in the overall epidemic, but could prevent a large proportion of cases of XDR tuberculosis in hospital staff. The combination of mask use with reduced hospitalisation time and a shift to outpatient therapy could prevent nearly a third of XDR tuberculosis cases. Supplementing this approach with improved ventilation, rapid drug resistance testing, HIV treatment, and tuberculosis isolation facilities could avert 48\% of XDR tuberculosis cases (range 34-50\%) by the end of 2012. However, involuntary detention could result in an unexpected rise in incidence due to restricted isolation capacity.A synergistic combination of available nosocomial infection control strategies could prevent nearly half of XDR tuberculosis cases, even in a resource-limited setting. XDR tuberculosis transmission will probably continue in the community, indicating the need to develop and implement parallel community-based programmes.},

Isoniazid (INH) resistant TB was observed to increase by <1\% per year, even when using pessimistic assumptions about resistance emergence. The use of tuberculin skin testing had little impact as a screening procedure, while secondary treatment was observed to nearly double the impact of a preventive treatment program. Regardless of whether or not preventive treatment was implemented, INH-resistant TB rose in the context of increasing HIV prevalence, but was minimally amplified by preventive treatment itself.IPT programs implemented through ARV clinics may be effective at reducing TB incidence. The resistance contribution of IPT appears unlikely to supersede its overall incidence and mortality benefits.},

Roy Polio Clinic and Hospital for Crippled Children in 1965-80. Yearly statistics indicate a rising trend in the incidence of polio, with the lowest number of cases (522) encountered in 1966 and the highest number (2208) in 1979. 48\% of patients attened the hospital in the acute stage of the disease and 10\% were seen in the residual stage. The cases came from virtually all the states of India, indicating polio's endemic characteristic. An unexpected finding was that the polio cases were equally distributed between urban (50.03\%) and rural (49.98\%) areas. The duration of illness was 1-30 days in 48\% of cases, 31 days-2 years in 42\% of cases, and over 2 years in another 10\%. Of interest was the observation of a uniform fluctuation (a peak followed by a lull) in alternate years. It is speculated that, in the years with a higher disease incidence, the immunity status of the population improves from subclinical infection. These findings point to a need for continuing emphasis on the prevention and control of poliomyelitis as well as proper surveillance and recording.},

  Abstract                 = {A prospective epidemiological survey was carried out over a period of seven weeks in a medical intensive care unit. Bacteria from patients, staff and air were monitored and the transmission of isolated microorganisms was followed. Handwashing samples revealed pathogenic bacteria in 30.8\% of physicians (average number of colony forming units: 71,300 per hand) and 16.6\% of nurses (39,800 cfu per hand). Air cultures yielded pathogens in 15\% of sampling periods and nine of 53 patients were found to be colonized with Gram-negative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus or Candida spp. The spectrum of bacteria recovered from patients and air was generally different, whereas strains recovered from patients and their attendants' hands were indistinguishable on multiple occasions. The results of this study confirm that direct contact is the principal pathway of microbial transmission, whereas little evidence for a significant role of airborne transmission is shown. The call for more extensive air-filtering and ventilation systems in medical intensive care units is not supported by the results shown in this communication.},

  Abstract                 = {Formulation and evaluation of public health policy commonly employs science-based mathematical models. For instance, epidemiological dynamics of TB is dominated, in general, by flow between actively and latently infected populations. Thus modelling is central in planning public health intervention. However, models are highly uncertain because they are based on observations that are geographically and temporally distinct from the population to which they are applied.We aim to demonstrate the advantages of info-gap theory, a non-probabilistic approach to severe uncertainty when worst cases cannot be reliably identified and probability distributions are unreliable or unavailable. Info-gap is applied here to mathematical modelling of epidemics and analysis of public health decision-making.Applying info-gap robustness analysis to tuberculosis/HIV (TB/HIV) epidemics, we illustrate the critical role of incorporating uncertainty in formulating recommendations for interventions. Robustness is assessed as the magnitude of uncertainty that can be tolerated by a given intervention. We illustrate the methodology by exploring interventions that alter the rates of diagnosis, cure, relapse and HIV infection.We demonstrate several policy implications. Equivalence among alternative rates of diagnosis and relapse are identified. The impact of initial TB and HIV prevalence on the robustness to uncertainty is quantified. In some configurations, increased aggressiveness of intervention improves the predicted outcome but also reduces the robustness to uncertainty. Similarly, predicted outcomes may be better at larger target times, but may also be more vulnerable to model error.The info-gap framework is useful for managing model uncertainty and is attractive when uncertainties on model parameters are extreme. When a public health model underlies guidelines, info-gap decision theory provides valuable insight into the confidence of achieving agreed-upon goals.},

Mathematical modelling and experience in resource-rich countries suggest HIV drug-resistance transmission will increase as antiretroviral therapy coverage increases, but its rise will be limited initially. Transmission surveys should begin in geographic areas in each country where antiretroviral therapy coverage is widespread. Reports from resource-limited countries suggest that antiretroviral therapy programs are as effective as in resource-rich countries, which should limit HIV drug resistance if effectiveness is maintained with antiretroviral therapy expansion. Surveillance of HIV drug resistance emerging in treatment and other factors will support implementation of prevention measures on a population level.Standardized surveillance of transmitted and treatment-associated HIV drug resistance is critical to the success of antiretroviral therapy expansion in developing countries. Routine assessment of prescribing practices, availability of and access to appropriate regimens for adults and children, antiretroviral drug supply continuity, and measures to prevent HIV transmission will supply critical information for HIV drug-resistance prevention.},

An integral component of pandemic preparedness in many countries was the targeted use of antiviral therapy for containment, disease mitigation, and treatment. The 2009 pandemic marked the first pandemic during which influenza antivirals were available for global use. Although most national pandemic plans included provisions for antiviral treatment, these pre-determined protocols required frequent updating as more information became available about the virus, and its susceptibility to antiviral agents, the epidemiology of infection, and the population groups that were most susceptible to severe disease. National public health agencies in countries with both plans for use of antivirals and pre-existing stockpiles, including those in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, operated distinctly different antiviral distribution and treatment programs from one another. In the 3 years following the pandemic, there is still little comparison of the diversity of national antiviral treatment policies and drug distribution mechanisms that were implemented, whether they had any mitigating effects and which might be most efficient. The purpose of this study is to outline roles of antiviral medicines in a pandemic period, provide insights into the diversity of antiviral treatment and distribution policies applied by selected countries between April 2009-July 2010, and to stimulate discussion on whether these policies remain appropriate for implementation in future pandemics.},

  Abstract                 = {To study the impact of the HIV epidemic on tuberculosis (TB) incidence in developing countries.A simple mathematical model is constructed using figures from published reports to estimate the rise of TB incidence as the HIV epidemic expands.Two groups with different risk of developing TB are identified: individuals with dual infection of HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the rest of the population. The model is based on a combination of the incidence and the percentage of TB in these two groups. The expected rise in TB incidence and the percentage of TB cases that will be HIV-positive are plotted against the prevalence of HIV.Unless appropriate action is taken, TB incidence in developing countries will double as the prevalence of HIV infection reaches 13 per hundred adults.95\% of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the world live in developing countries. HIV infection greatly increases the risk of developing active TB among those with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Thus researchers have used data from existing research to develop a mathematical model to gauge the increase in TB incidence in developing countries while considering rising HIV prevalence among adults. They look at 2 groups with sizable differences in risk of acquiring TB: adults with both HIV and M. tuberculosis infections and all other adults. The researchers plot the expected increase in TB incidence and percentage of TB cases that also have HIV infection against HIV prevalence. According to the model, when the prevalence of HIV infection hits 13\% of adults in developing countries, the number of new TB cases doubles. Most of this increase will occur in areas that already lack diagnostic services, drugs, hospital beds, and other needed supplies. TB chemoprophylaxis treatment of HIV-positive people could result in a lower increase in TB incidence, however. WHO has set a goal of 50\% reduction in TB incidence by 2002. Public health officials could use this model to plan TB control programs to bring about a reduction in the increase. Even though TB control programs can help stem the projected increase, it will be very difficult for developing countries with high HIV prevalence to hold back the projected rise in TB incidence. Developing countries must take considerable appropriate action soon to prevent doubling of TB incidence as HIV prevalence nears 13\% of adults.},

  Abstract                 = {Therapy of tumors expressing somatostatin receptors, sstr, has recently been clinically tested using somatostatin analogues labeled with (111)In and (90)Y. Several other radionuclides, i.e., (131)I, (161)Tb, (64)Cu, (188)Re, (177)Lu, and (67)Ga, have also been proposed for this type of therapy. The aim of this work was to investigate the usefulness of the above-mentioned radionuclides bound to somatostatin analogues for tumor therapy.Biokinetic data of (111)In-labeled octreotide in mice and man were used, primarily from our studies but sometimes from the literature. Dosimetric calculations were performed with the assumption that biokinetics were similar for all radionuclides bound to somatostatin analogues. The cumulated tumor:normal-tissue activity concentration, TNC was calculated for the various physical half-lives of the radionuclides. Using mathematical models, the tumor:normal-tissue mean absorbed dose rate ratio, TN D and tumor:normal-tissue mean absorbed dose ratio, TND, were calculated for various tumor sizes in mice and humans.TNC of radionuclide-labeled octreotide increased with physical half-life for most organs, both in mice and in humans. TN D showed that radionuclides emitting electrons with too high energy are not suitable for therapy of small tumors. Furthermore, radionuclides with a higher frequency of photon emissions relative to electron emissions will yield lower TN D and are thus less suitable for therapy than radionuclides with a lower frequency of photon emissions. The TND was highest for (161)Tb in both mice and humans.The results demonstrate that long-lived radionuclides, which emit electrons with rather low energy and which have low frequency of photon emissions, should be the preferred therapy for disseminated small sstr-expressing tumors.},

  Abstract                 = {Hepatitis A outbreaks are well documented among men who have sex with men (MSM). This analysis examines characteristics associated with hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection among a large group of young adult MSM from five USA cities.The Young Men's Survey was a cross-sectional prevalence study of HIV infection and related behavioural risk factors among MSM aged 15-29 years during 1994-2000. Serum specimens from HIV-negative participants were retrospectively tested for antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV). Data were stratified by ethnicity and analysed with logistic regression.Overall anti-HAV prevalence was 18.4\% among the 2708 participants, and varied by ethnicity from 6.9 to 45.3\% and was highest among Hispanic and Asian men (P < 0.001). Prevalence increased with age across all racial/ethnic groups. Among white men, anti-HAV positivity was associated with having 20 or more lifetime male sex partners for those aged 15-22 years (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.1, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.0-4.1) and ever having had unprotected anal sex for those aged 23-29 years (AOR=2.4, 95\% CI=1.2-4.5).Factors associated with a history of HAV infection among MSM in non-outbreak settings are probably similar to those among non-MSM. MSM are still at risk for HAV infection as a result of outbreaks occurring in MSM communities. Additional studies of hepatitis A vaccination coverage are needed to determine if strategies to vaccinate MSM are adequate.},

  Abstract                 = {Whole genome sequencing (WGS) technology holds great promise as a tool for the forensic epidemiology of bacterial pathogens. It is likely to be particularly useful for studying the transmission dynamics of an observed epidemic involving a largely unsampled 'reservoir' host, as for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in British and Irish cattle and badgers. BTB is caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the M. tuberculosis complex that also includes the aetiological agent for human TB. In this study, we identified a spatio-temporally linked group of 26 cattle and 4 badgers infected with the same Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) type of M. bovis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between sequences identified differences that were consistent with bacterial lineages being persistent on or near farms for several years, despite multiple clear whole herd tests in the interim. Comparing WGS data to mathematical models showed good correlations between genetic divergence and spatial distance, but poor correspondence to the network of cattle movements or within-herd contacts. Badger isolates showed between zero and four SNP differences from the nearest cattle isolate, providing evidence for recent transmissions between the two hosts. This is the first direct genetic evidence of M. bovis persistence on farms over multiple outbreaks with a continued, ongoing interaction with local badgers. However, despite unprecedented resolution, directionality of transmission cannot be inferred at this stage. Despite the often notoriously long timescales between time of infection and time of sampling for TB, our results suggest that WGS data alone can provide insights into TB epidemiology even where detailed contact data are not available, and that more extensive sampling and analysis will allow for quantification of the extent and direction of transmission between cattle and badgers.},

Humanitarian agencies usually postpone the decision to offer TB treatment and opportunities to treat TB patients are often missed. This paper looks at the problem of tuberculosis treatment in these emergencies and questions whether treatment guidelines could be more flexible than international recommendations. A mathematical model is used to calculate the risks and benefits of different treatment scenarios with increasing default rates. Model outcomes are compared to a situation without treatment. An economic analysis further discusses the findings in a trade-off between the extra costs of treating relapses and failures and the savings in future treatment costs. In complex emergencies, if a TB programme could offer 4-month treatment for 75\% of its patients, it could still be considered beneficial in terms of public health. In addition, the proportion of patients following at least 4 months of treatment can be used as an indicator to help evaluate the public health harm and benefit of the TB programme.},

Our data also confirm that disappearance of entire elements is the main event in age-related loss of trabecular bone. In addition, our study demonstrated that Tb.Wi is lower in women than in men in the IC site, and a preferential loss of the thinner trabeculae could be seen in this group. Up to 50 years, Tb.N was found higher in women in both sites. B.Ar and Tb.Wi values are markedly higher in the TI site (+/- 15\%); Tb.N values were similar. Measured and calculated Tb.Wi values show systematic differences. In a pilot study in 14 IC biopsies with widely diverging B.Ar values, we tested the validity of several equations currently used for derived parameters in the structural analysis of cancellous bone sections. The equation for mean trabecular number passed the test, whereas the validity of the equations for mean trabecular separation and Tb.Wi appeared limited. We found anisotropy of iliac bone to increase as B.Ar decreases.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last two or three decades, growing numbers of parents in the industrialized world are choosing not to have their children vaccinated. In trying to explain why this is occurring, public health commentators refer to the activities of an anti-vaccination 'movement'. In the light of three decades of research on (new) social movements, what sense does it make to attribute decline in vaccination rates to the actions of an influential anti-vaccination movement? Two sorts of empirical data, drawn largely from UK and The Netherlands, are reviewed. These relate to the claims, actions and discourse of anti-vaccination groups on the one hand, and to the way parents of young children think about vaccines and vaccination on the other. How much theoretical sense it makes to view anti-vaccination groups as (new) social movement organizations (as distinct from pressure groups or self-help organizations) is as yet unclear. In any event there is no simple and unambiguous demarcation criterion. From a public health perspective, however, to focus attention on organized opponents of vaccination is appealing because it unites health professionals behind a banner of reason. At the same time it diverts attention from a potentially disruptive critique of vaccination practices; the critique in fact articulated by many parents. In the light of current theoretical discussion of 'scientific citizenship' this paper argues that identifying anti-vaccination groups with other social movements may ultimately have the opposite effect to that intended.},

MDR-TB and, in particular, the emergence of XDR-TB, have re-opened the debate on the importance, and nature, of treatment supervision for basic TB control and the management of drug-resistant TB. Enforcing compulsory measures regarding TB patients raises questions of respect for human rights. Yet, international law provides for rights-limiting principles, which would justify enforcing compulsory measures against TB patients who refuse to have diagnostic procedures or who refuse to be monitored and treated once disease is confirmed. This article analyzes under what circumstances compulsory measures for TB patients may be enforced under international law. Compulsory measures for TB patients may, in fact, be justified on legal grounds provided that these measures are foreseen in the law, that they are used as a last resort, and that safeguards are in place to protect affected individuals. The deadly nature of the disease, its epidemiology, the high case fatality rate, and the speed at which the disease leads to death when associated with HIV are proven.},

Because the effectiveness of interventions varies with time, it has been suggested that epidemic phases should be considered in the design of prevention strategies. This study aimed to examine the impact of HIV epidemic phases on the effectiveness of HIV interventions based on gonorrhoea screening and condom use, targeted to core groups. The results are based on a mathematical model of gonorrhoea and HIV transmission in a relatively slow spreading HIV epidemic using Cotonou (Benin) as an example. For epidemics with a low reproductive potential modest core group interventions can significantly reduce HIV incidence and prevalence. As the epidemic matures, effective interventions should also incorporate core and non-core populations. For epidemics with a high reproductive potential, core group interventions are necessary but not sufficient to have a rapid and large scale impact. A more general population approach is also needed early in the epidemic. Epidemic phases are also important in the evaluation of prevention strategies.},

The biological basis was uncertain, but could be related to increased TB susceptibility among lower producing dairy cows. In this study, the relationship between somatic cell count (as an objective measure of udder health) and SICTT reactivity (as a proxy for TB infection status) was investigated. Somatic cell counts of TB infected cows, both during and prior to the lactation of diagnosis of TB infection, were examined and compared to non-infected cows. All Irish dairy herds restricted from trading between June 2004 and May 2005 as a result of two or more TB reactors (test positive) to the SICTT were considered for study. Data were collected on 4340 cows from 419 herds. Previous lactation data for the cows were taken into consideration and all lactations on a cow were analysed together with the years of lactations. There was an inherent hierarchical structure in the data, with lactations nested within cows and cows within herds and so a linear mixed model with two random effects was used to describe the data. Milk production (305-day milk yield) was also included in the model as a fixed effect. The results of the study showed that for all lactations and years under investigation, somatic cell counts for SICTT reactor cows when compared to the non-reactor cows were not significantly different. In this study population, TB infection status was not associated with udder health.},

  Abstract                 = {This study describes the relationship between bovine tuberculosis (TB) and milk yield in TB-infected dairy herds in Ireland. The study had two objectives: to determine whether cows detected as TB reactors (and thus subject to immediate slaughter) were likely to be the higher milk-producing cows, and to determine whether subclinical TB infection was associated with reduced milk production at or around the time of disclosure (detection). All Irish dairy herds restricted from trading between the 1(st) June 2004 and the 31(st) May 2005 as a result of two or more TB reactors by the Single Intradermal Comparative Tuberculin Test (SICTT) were considered for study. The data consisted of 419 herds. Data were collected on all TB reactors and a random sample of 5 non-reactor cows in these herds: a data set of 4340 cows (2342 TB reactors and 1998 non-reactors). Previous milk data for the cows were taken into consideration and thus all lactations on a cow were analysed together with the years of lactations. There was an inherent hierarchical structure in the data, with lactations nested within cows and cows within herds and thus a linear mixed model with two random effects was used to describe the data. The results of this study showed that for all lactations and years under investigation, milk yield was significantly lower for TB reactor cows, with differences ranging from 120kg (2003, lactation 3) to 573kg (2001, lactation 1), when compared to the non-reactor cows.},

  Abstract                 = {Elemental mapping consists in searching the distribution of a given chemical species over an extended specimen area, with relation to topographical or structural features. It can be done with EELS core signals from a combination of several energy filtered images. One major problem encountered in the processing of such sequences of images lies in the extrapolation errors due to a difficult estimate of the background below the characteristic signal. The chosen method must be sufficiently reliable to avoid the risk of both "false positive" and "false negative" values: the first category may stem from spurious signals or from a non-satisfactory fit of the background. The second category is mainly due to a limited sensitivity. The EELS signal is often much weaker than the background intensity; an extrapolation error can therefore transform a negative value into a positive one, or vice versa. The purpose of the present contribution is to check the validity of the processing at different levels: i) different mathematical models of background; ii) different types of fitting procedures (one-parameter and two-parameters fits); iii) different fitting methods and several associated manipulations, such as a quasi local estimation of the involved fitting parameters. The statistical validity of those techniques is discussed through several tests on real images obtained from different specimens (Co/CeO2 catalysts, ferritin molecules, U and Tb staining clusters). Progress is made on the way of quantitative elemental mapping at a given confidence level, and towards the identification of single atoms.},

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models predict that the future of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) epidemic will depend to a large extent on the transmission efficiency or relative fitness of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis compared to drug-susceptible strains. Molecular epidemiological studies comparing the spread of drug-resistant to that of drug-susceptible strains have yielded conflicting results: MDR strains can be up to 10 times more or 10 times less transmissible than pan-susceptible strains. Experimental work performed with model organisms has highlighted a level of complexity in the biology of bacterial drug resistance that is generally not considered during standard epidemiological studies of TB transmission. Recent experimental studies in M. tuberculosis indicate that drug resistance in this organism could be equally complex. For example, the relative fitness of drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis can be influenced by the specific drug resistance-conferring mutation and strain genetic background. Furthermore, compensatory evolution, which has been shown to mitigate the fitness defects associated with drug resistance in other bacteria, could be an important factor in the emergence and spread of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. However, much more work is needed to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms and evolutionary forces that drive drug resistance in this pathogen. Such increased knowledge will allow for better epidemiological predictions and assist in the development of new tools and strategies to fight drug-resistant TB.},

Surprisingly, DOTS has been reported to reduce the transmission of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and standardized short-course chemotherapy regimens with first-line agents have been found to be adequate treatments for some patients with drug resistant tuberculosis, including multi-drug resistance. These paradoxical observations and the apparent heterogeneity in treatment outcome of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis when using standard regimens may be due in part to limitations of in vitro drug susceptibility testing based on unique but mistakenly used techniques in diagnostic mycobacteriology. Experimental data and mathematical models indicate that the fitness cost conferred by a resistance determinant is the single most important parameter which determines the spread of drug resistance. Chromosomal alterations that result in resistance to first-line antituberculosis agents, e.g. isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, may or may not be associated with a fitness cost. Based on work in experimental models and from observations in clinical drug resistant isolates a picture emerges in which, among the various resistance mutations that appear with similar rates, those associated with the least fitness cost are selected in the population.},

Extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR) is also resistant to more than 3 of the 6 classes of second line drugs including fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. The multidrug resistance is increasing in Asia and Eastern Europe. For the moment, the phenomena is rare in France (involving 1,1\% of tuberculosis cases with 4\% of MDR tested XDR). The best preventive measure consists in a proper use of antituberculosis drugs with combined therapy including at least 3 active drugs during the first 2 months. Another challenge is to be aware of the possiblility of resistance and to prevent further transmission to other patients by airborne isolation measures, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.},

Central to these planning efforts in the health-care sector are strategies to minimise the transmission of influenza to health-care workers and patients. The infection control precautions necessary to prevent airborne, droplet, and contact transmission are quite different and will need to be decided on and planned before a pandemic occurs. Despite vast clinical experience in human beings, there continues to be much debate about how influenza is transmitted. We have done a systematic review of the English language experimental and epidemiological literature on this subject to better inform infection control planning efforts. We have found that the existing data are limited with respect to the identification of specific modes of transmission in the natural setting. However, we are able to conclude that transmission occurs at close range rather than over long distances, suggesting that airborne transmission, as traditionally defined, is unlikely to be of significance in most clinical settings. Further research is required to better define conditions under which the influenza virus may transmit via the airborne route.},

The leakage of preencapsulated Tb3+ was also measured. The analysis of the data provided estimates for the rate of aggregation C11, and the rate of fusion per se, f11. An increase in cholesterol contents results in a decrease in C11 values. Similarly, aggregation of PS/cholesterol vesicles is slower than that of PS vesicles in the presence of 650 mM NaCl. With 100 or 200 mM NaCl, the overall fusion rate of PS/cholesterol vesicles is slower than that of PS vesicles; the rate being reduced by an increase in cholesterol contents. With 600 mM NaCl, the overall fusion rate of PS/cholesterol 9:1 vesicles is faster than that of PS vesicles, and results are well-simulated by assuming no delay in vesicle aggregation up to dimers. Emerging f11 values are larger in PS/cholesterol than in PS vesicles. An analysis of fusion kinetics of several lipid concentrations shows that f11 values of PS/cholesterol 3:1 vesicles are 5-times larger than those of PS vesicles, when fusion occurs in a medium containing 200 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM Ca2+. The increase in Na+ concentration from 100 to 200 mM, or 600 mM results in a 50- or 150-fold reduction in f11 values of PS vesicles. It is suggested that incorporation of cholesterol in PS vesicles results in enhancement of Ca2+-induced fusogenic capacity.},

The removal or replacement of metal ions was monitored by changes in sensitized Tb(III) luminescence or in intrinsic protein tryptophan fluorescence as quenching ions [Eu(III) or Yb(III)] were bound or removed or as the apoprotein was formed. In experiments wherein the bound metal ions were removed by mixing the parvalbumin with an excess of 1,2-diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid (DCTA), the kinetic traces were best fit by a double exponential with koff rate constants of 1.07 and 5.91 s-1 for Ca(II), 1.54 and 10.5 s-1 for Cd(II), and approximately 0.05 and approximately 0.5 s-1 for all of the trivalent lanthanide ions. In experiments wherein the bound metal ions were exchanged with an excess of a different metal ion, pseudo-first-order rate constants were proportional to the concentration of excess attacking metal ion for both the fast and slow processes in most experiments. In these cases, extrapolation of the rate constants to zero concentration of attacking metal ion gave values which agree well with the DCTA scavenging results. This finding demonstrates that the off rate constants do not depend on the occupancy of the neighboring site and therefore implies that there is no significant cooperativity in metal ion binding between the two sites in parvalbumin.},

  Abstract                 = {Proximity to an infectious TB case is a potential risk in any close contact setting. However, the rapid growth in airline transportation is in stark contrast to the lack of evidence about the prevalence of TB among airline passengers and crew. The rate of ventilation in the aircraft cabin is far superior to other forms of transportation and reduces the risk of airborne transmission.This study calculated TB disease rates among passengers and cabin crew during the 5-year study period. The principal study outcome was the number of notifications of confirmed TB disease cases and potential under-reporting was estimated. The airline rates were compared with the WHO definition of low incidence--"a TB notification rate below 10 per 100,000 population and declining".The TB case notification rate was 0.05 per 100,000 long-haul passengers. The risk increased seven-fold on flights from TB-endemic areas in Africa or India. The aircraft cabin remains classified as a low TB incidence environment on all routes within a wide margin of error. Low occupational prevalence was observed in the cabin crew workforce.Airline passengers are considered to be a select group with low TB rates. This study provides important evidence that confirms the aircraft as a low-risk setting for transmission of TB and emphasizes the presence of environmental-control measures that reduce the risk as far as possible.},

  Abstract                 = {Progress in understanding the biological processes that allow Mycobacterium tuberculosis to be a successful parasite have accelerated in the last twenty years. This progress has been stimulated by the return of tuberculosis (TB) as an important disease in industrialized countries, by its increase in emergent nations in the tail of population increases and poverty and by the spread of multiple drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis as a result of treatment failures. Progress on M. tuberculosis biology has also been fueled by advances in microbiology and molecular biology, including molecular genetics, genomics, proteomics and in vitro and in vivo models of infection. The study of latency or dormancy, a phenomenon central to understanding the persistence of M. tuberculosis and the development of TB in individuals, its spread in human populations and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant/tolerant organisms, has been preferred targets for investigators in this area. In this manner, factors that trigger M. tuberculosis latency (e. g, hypoxia, nutrient starvation, NO exposure) have been characterized and the metabolic shifts to host lipid utilization, tolerance to antimicrobials and resistance to host immune mechanisms involved in latency have been determined. Similarly, genetic changes and the resulting antimicrobial mechanisms mediating the MDR and XDR states have been characterized and potential new vaccines that avoid reactivation from latency and infection are being developed. Despite this progress, and given the fact that effective anti tuberculosis therapy was developed and first introduced clinically at the end of the 1940s, there are now more cases of latent and active TB worldwide than ever before. This reinforces the concept of TB as a bacterial disease with strong social and economical! determinants which are presently stimulating increased transmission in many human groups, undermining diagnostics, treatment and prevention. It suggests that in a scenario of global economical crisis the struggle against TB will be weakened, unless efforts are included to alleviate poverty, decrease economic inequality, improve public health and allow democracy and political organization.},

  Abstract                 = {Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis are generally thought to have high mortality rates. However, many cases can be treated with the right combination and rational use of available antituberculosis drugs. This Review describes the evidence available for each drug and discusses the basis for recommendations for the treatment of patients with MDR and XDR tuberculosis. The recommended regimen is the combination of at least four drugs to which the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate is likely to be susceptible. Drugs are chosen with a stepwise selection process through five groups on the basis of efficacy, safety, and cost. Among the first group (the oral first-line drugs) high-dose isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol are thought of as an adjunct for the treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis. The second group is the fluoroquinolones, of which the first choice is high-dose levofloxacin. The third group are the injectable drugs, which should be used in the following order: capreomycin, kanamycin, then amikacin. The fourth group are called the second-line drugs and should be used in the following order: thioamides, cycloserine, then aminosalicylic acid. The fifth group includes drugs that are not very effective or for which there are sparse clinical data. Drugs in group five should be used in the following order: clofazimine, amoxicillin with clavulanate, linezolid, carbapenems, thioacetazone, then clarithromycin.},

A decision tree was built to represent the complications associated with measles cases and adverse events following immunisation. Monte-Carlo Simulation techniques were used to account for uncertainty.From the perspective of society, we estimated the average cost per measles case to be US$276, US$307 and US$254 for the NL, the UK and Canada, respectively, and the average cost of adverse events following immunisation per vaccinee to be US$1.43, US$1.93 and US$1.51 for the NL, UK and Canada, respectively.These average cost estimates could be combined with incidence estimates and costs of immunisation programmes to provide estimates of the cost of measles to industrialised countries. Such estimates could be used as a basis to estimate the potential economic gains of global measles eradication.},

  Abstract                 = {The incidence of reported pertussis has increased during the past decade and poses a growing health and economic burden in developed countries, despite high rates of primary vaccination. Administration of a booster dose of acellular pertussis vaccine to adolescents may help reduce this burden, not only by reducing infections in vaccinated individuals but also by reducing transmission of Bordetella pertussis to other individuals, particularly infants. An epidemiologic model was created to assess the health and economic impact of implementing a program of routine acellular pertussis immunization in adolescents 11-18 years of age in the United States, considering both the reduction in cases in those vaccinated and among the unvaccinated population (due to herd immunity). Inputs for the base case were defined according to information derived from published literature and were supplemented by estimates provided by members of the Global Pertussis Initiative. Both direct and indirect costs were included (in 2002 US dollars) using U.S. data. Outcomes were evaluated over the lifetime of a cohort of potential adolescent vaccine candidates. Because of uncertainty in many of the inputs, extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. With 80\% vaccination coverage of adolescents and a 20\% reduction of other cases because of herd immunity, >68,000 cases and 41 pertussis-related deaths would be avoided in the subsequent 10 years by routine administration of acellular pertussis boosters to a single cohort of adolescents in the United States. This strategy would be cost-effective, incurring from 6000 US dollars to 22,000 US dollars per life-year gained. The level of herd immunity attained and the true incidence of pertussis are critical determinants of cost effectiveness, as is the duration of immunity resulting from immunization. The cost of immunization and the discount rate also play a role. Although there is considerable uncertainty surrounding key inputs, the results indicate that the conditions required for adolescent immunization to be economically warranted are realistic.},

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of viral shedding and symptoms following influenza virus infection are key factors when considering epidemic control measures. The authors reviewed published studies describing the course of influenza virus infection in placebo-treated and untreated volunteers challenged with wild-type influenza virus. A total of 56 different studies with 1,280 healthy participants were considered. Viral shedding increased sharply between 0.5 and 1 day after challenge and consistently peaked on day 2. The duration of viral shedding averaged over 375 participants was 4.80 days (95\% confidence interval: 4.31, 5.29). The frequency of symptomatic infection was 66.9\% (95\% confidence interval: 58.3, 74.5). Fever was observed in 37.0\% of A/H1N1, 40.6\% of A/H3N2 (p = 0.86), and 7.5\% of B infections (p = 0.001). The total symptoms scores increased on day 1 and peaked on day 3. Systemic symptoms peaked on day 2. No such data exist for children or elderly subjects, but epidemiologic studies suggest that the natural history might differ. The present analysis confirms prior expert opinion on the duration of viral shedding or the frequency of asymptomatic influenza infection, extends prior knowledge on the dynamics of viral shedding and symptoms, and provides original results on the frequency of respiratory symptoms or fever.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis has re-emerged as a public health concern in high-income countries in the last few decades. The European region accounts for only 5\% of world TB cases. The incidence of new TB cases in Europe varies from very low rates in Scandinavian countries (six to eight cases/100,000 population) to rates as high as 231 cases/100,000 population in Tajikistan; the Russian Federation is eleventh among the 22 high-burden TB countries. The estimated detection rate of new sputum smear-positive pulmonary cases and the treatment success rate in 2007 were poor compared with other WHO regions: 51\% of cases were diagnosed and 70\% of them completed a full course of anti-TB therapy, which is still a long way from the World Health Assembly targets (detection of 70\% of infectious cases and successful treatment of 85\% of them). The low success rate is largely attributable to the increasing number of drug-resistant TB cases: Eastern European countries are among those with the highest rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB (TB resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid) in the world. By the end of September 2009, at least one case of extensively drug-resistant TB (named XDR-TB and defined as a MDR-TB strain with additional resistance to any fluoroquinolone, and to at least one of three injectable drugs used in anti-TB treatment) had been reported by 25 countries in the WHO European Region. In Western Europe, TB continues to cause disease among elderly native-born individuals, although high-risk groups including immigrants, prisoners, HIV-infected persons and drug addicts significantly contribute to the overall burden. Improved TB control in Europe requires a large coordinated effort by all stakeholders, including governments, governmental and non-governmental institutions, as well as the academic and private sectors and affected communities.},

Proposed definitions are ambiguous, and extensive drug resistance is encompassed by the already defined extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. There is no evidence that proposed totally resistant TB differs from strains encompassed by XDR TB. Susceptibility tests for several drugs are poorly reproducible. Few laboratories can test all drugs, and there is no consensus list of all anti-TB drugs. Many drugs are used off-label for highly drug resistant TB, and new drugs formulated to combat resistant strains would render the proposed category obsolete. Labeling TB strains as totally drug resistant might lead providers to think infected patients are untreatable. These challenges must be addressed before defining a new category for highly drug-resistant TB.},

  Abstract                 = {Nigeria is one of only four countries that have never interrupted poliovirus transmission (the others are Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan). A resurgence in wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission occurred in Nigeria during 2003-2004 after a loss of public confidence in oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and suspension of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs)* in several northern states. Subsequently, WPV spread within Nigeria and ultimately into 20 previously polio-free countries during 2003-2006. Even after national SIAs resumed, limited acceptance and ongoing operational problems resulted in low polio vaccination coverage and continued WPV transmission. Beginning in 2006, health authorities in Nigeria introduced new initiatives to control the spread of WPV, including a focus on interrupting type 1 WPV (WPV1) transmission and use of monovalent type 1 OPV (mOPV1) for most of the SIAs to increase vaccine effectiveness. Nigeria also instituted changes in SIA implementation to increase community acceptance of vaccination. Subsequently, 285 polio cases were reported in Nigeria in 2007, the lowest number since sensitive surveillance has been in place. As of August 12, 2008, confirmed polio cases reported in Nigeria totaled 556 (including 511 WPV1 cases), compared with 176 cases (53 WPV1) reported during the same period in 2007. This report updates overall progress toward polio eradication in Nigeria during 2007-2008. Given the increase in WPV transmission thus far in 2008, urgent measures are needed to reach all children during SIAs to bring WPV under control in Nigeria.},

However, major innovations to the national polio-eradication program in Nigeria were initiated in 2006. These innovations, if sustained, should advance the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Nigeria (2006 population: 140 million) experienced a resurgence in wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission during 2003-2004 after a loss of public confidence in oral polio vaccine (OPV) and suspension of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in certain northern states. Subsequently, WPV spread within Nigeria and into 19 polio-free countries.

To increase the effectiveness of polio-eradication measures and community acceptance of vaccination, in 2006, health authorities in Nigeria introduced monovalent type 1 OPV (mOPV1) vaccine and changed the way SIAs were implemented.

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis (TB) is still a major public health problem, compounded by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-TB co-infection and recent emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB. In this context, aspartokinase of mycobacterium tuberculosis has drawn attention for designing novel anti-TB drugs. Asp kinase is an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of 4-phospho-L-aspartate from L-aspartate and involved in the branched biosynthetic pathway leading to the synthesis of amino acids lysine, threonine, methionine and isoleucine. An intermediate of lysine biosynthetic branch, mesodiaminopimelate is also a component of the peptidoglycan which is a component of bacterial cell wall. To interfere with the production of all these amino acids and cell wall, it is possible to inhibit Asp kinase activity. This can be achieved using Asp kinase inhibitors. In order to design novel Asp kinase inhibitors as effective anti-TB drugs, it is necessary to have an understanding of the binding sites of Asp kinase. As no crystal structure of the enzyme has yet been published, we built a homology model of Asp kinase using the crystallized Asp kinase from M. Jannaschii, as template structures (2HMF and 3C1M). After the molecular dynamics refinement, the optimized homology model was assessed as a reliable structure by PROCHECK, ERRAT, WHAT-IF, PROSA2003 and VERIFY-3D. The results of molecular docking studies with natural substrates, products and feedback inhibitors are in agreement with the published data and showed that ACT domain plays an important role in binding to ligands. Based on the docking conformations, pharmacophore model can be developed by probing the common features of ligands. By analyzing the results, ACT domain architecture, certain key residues that are responsible for binding to feedback inhibitors and natural substrates were identified. This would be very helpful in understanding the blockade mechanism of Asp kinase and providing insights into rational design of novel Asp kinase inhibitors for M.tuberculosis.},

  abstract    = {Drug-resistant tuberculosis has brought back the spectre of pre-antibiotic days. WHO surveillance data from 2007 showed multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)-tubercle bacillus resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin accounting for 4.8\% of all new and subsequent cases of tuberculosis. India and China-the two most populated countries of the world, house the maximum number of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases. In eastern European and central Asian countries, more than 6\% of new TB cases are MDR-TB, whereas the number is <3\% in the countries of the western world. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has emerged with the prospect of tuberculosis becoming an incurable disease. A surveillance spreading over the six continents showed 10\% of MDR-TB cases were also XDR-TB. The fact that tuberculosis is the most common opportunistic infection among HIV-infected patients in developing countries makes the challenge almost insurmountable. The mortality of HIV and MDR-TB co-infected patients is exceedingly high. The absence of guidelines for treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis and of infrastructure for delivery of DOT program and rapid laboratory diagnostic facilities, including drug susceptibility testing for both first and second-line drugs, and lack of trained human resource in most of the developing world account for the emergence and perpetuation of this menacing problem. WHO along with partnership with Green Light Committee and individual national governments has started DOT plus program to control this global epidemic.},

These two forms of highly drug-resistant TB threaten to make TB into an untreatable and highly fatal disease, particularly in resource-poor countries with a high prevalence of AIDS. The focus of this review is to highlight the current extent of the problem.There is a great variability in clinical outcomes for MDR-TB, in part due to differences in the definitions of outcome measures and retrospective nature of the studies. Outcomes for XDR-TB are uniformly worse than those for MDR-TB.A multifaceted approach is needed to prevent a more widespread epidemic of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Rapid diagnostic assays to detect highly drug-resistant TB are essential in preventing delays in treatment of MDR-TB and XDR-TB and curbing their spread. Development of new drugs to effectively treat all forms of TB in a shorter period of time is urgently needed.},

  Abstract                 = {Several molecules related to antigen presentation, including gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), are encoded by polymorphic genes. Some polymorphisms were found to affect susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) when they were considered singly in epidemiological studies, but how multiple polymorphisms interact to determine susceptibility to TB in an individual remains an open question. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in some genes may counteract or intensify the effects of polymorphisms in other genes. For example, an increase in IFN-gamma expression may counteract the weak binding that a particular MHC variant displays for a peptide from Mycobacterium tuberculosis to establish the same T-cell response as another, more strongly binding MHC variant. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model of antigen presentation based on experimental data for the known effects of genetic polymorphisms and simulated time courses when multiple polymorphisms were present. We found that polymorphisms in different genes could affect antigen presentation to the same extent and therefore compensate for each other. Furthermore, we defined the conditions under which such relationships could exist. For example, increased IFN-gamma expression compensated for decreased peptide-MHC affinity in the model only above a certain threshold of expression. Below this threshold, changes in IFN-gamma expression were ineffectual compared to changes in peptide-MHC affinity. The finding that polymorphisms exhibit such relationships could explain discrepancies in the epidemiological literature, where some polymorphisms have been inconsistently associated with susceptibility to TB. Furthermore, the model allows polymorphisms to be ranked by effect, providing a new tool for designing association studies.},

  abstract    = {Osteoporosis is now defined as a disease characterized by a decreased bone mass associated with micro-architectural modification of trabecular bone leading to an increased fragility and to bone fractures. Various histomorphometric methods have been described to measure bone architecture on histological sections. However, not all of methods are strictly equivalent and some of them appear able to detect differences earlier in the course of the disease. We have compared 8 histomorphometric methods known to characterize the architecture of trabecular bone in 55 male osteoporotic patients. Measurements were done on transiliac bone biopsies: Trabecular number, thickness and separation (Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp); Trabecular Bone Pattern Factor (TBPf); Euler-Poincaré's number (E); Interconnectivity Index (ICI); strut analysis of the trabecular network with the ratio of nodes/free-end (N/F); star volume of the bone marrow (Vm) and trabeculae (Vtrab) and the Kolmogorov fractal dimension of the trabecular boundaries (D). Relationships between the various architectural parameters were studied by hierarchical cluster analysis. Linear, hyperbolic and exponential correlations were found between trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) and architectural parameters. Cluster analysis demonstrates the link between these architectural parameters. ICI, E and TBPf which reflect the amount of open/closed marrow cavities clustered together and appeared related to Tb.Sp, which are indicators of the mean size of marrow cavities. Tb.Th, Vm and N/F flocked together as they reflect the trabecular size. Tb.N and D segregated together and seemed to best describe the trabecular network complexity. These histomorphometric techniques are correlated but correlations may be linear or non linear. Several histomorphometric techniques need to be used in parallel to appreciate the pathophysiological mechanisms of osteoporotic states.},

The Universal Immunization Program (UIP) achieved this target 3 months earlier than intended. In fact, at the end of December 1990, it achieved 110.6\% for DPT3, 142.16\% for OPV3, 151.96\% for BCG, and 97\% for measles. UIP was able to surpass its targets by emphasizing team work. Government, the private sector, UNICEF, and the voluntary sector made up the Apex Coordination Committee on Immunization headed up by the mayor. The committee drafted an action plan which included routine immunization sessions on a fixed day and intensive immunization drives. Further the involved organizations pooled together cold chain equipment. In addition, the District Family Welfare Bureau was the distribution center for vaccines, syringes, immunization cards, report formats, vaccine carriers, and ice packs. Health workers administered immunizations from about 300 centers generally on Wednesday, National Immunization Day. Intensive immunization drives focused on measles immunizations. UIP leaders encouraged all center to routinely record coverage and submit monthly progress reports to the District Family Welfare Bureau. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation coordinated promotion activities and social mobilization efforts. Promotion included radio and TV announcements, newspaper advertisements, cinema slides, billboards, and posters. The original UIP plan to use professional communicators to mobilize communities was ineffective, so nongovernmental organizations entered the slums to encourage people to encourage their neighbors to immunize their children. Further Islamic, Protestant, and Catholic leaders encouraged the faithful to immunize their children. A UNICEF officer noted that this success must be sustained, however.},

  Abstract                 = {In a population of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, random chromosomal mutation that results in genetic resistance to anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs occurs at a relatively low frequency. Anti-TB drugs impose selection pressure so that mycobacterial mutants gradually outnumber susceptible bacilli and emerge as the dominant strains. Resistance to two or more anti-TB drugs represents cumulative results of sequential mutation. The fourth report on global anti-TB drug resistance provides the latest data on the extent of such problem in the world. The median prevalence of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in new TB cases was 1.6\%, and in previously treated TB cases 11.7\%. Of the half a million MDR-TB cases estimated to have emerged in 2006, 50\% were in China and India. The optimal duration of any given combination of anti-TB drugs for treatment of MDR- and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has not been defined in controlled clinical trials. Standardized treatment may be feasible for MDR-TB patients not previously treated with second-line drugs, but a different strategy needs to be applied in the treatment of MDR-TB patients who have received second-line drugs before. Unfortunately, the reliability of drug susceptibility testing of most second-line anti-TB drugs is still questionable. Drug-resistant TB is not necessarily less virulent. Findings from modelling exercise warned that if MDR-TB case detection and treatment rates increase to the World Health Organization target of 70\%, without simultaneously increasing MDR-TB cure rates, XDR-TB prevalence could increase exponentially. Prevention of development of drug resistance must be accorded the top priority in the era of MDR-/XDR-TB.},

Potential risk factors associated with the readmission were recorded during hospital stay and follow-up visits, including age, sex, length of stay, substance abuse, need of assistance in the activities of daily living (ADL), comorbidities, non-compliance, drug complications and use of non-standard drug regimen.Up to 20.1\% of patients were readmitted. Factors independently associated with early unplanned readmission were need of assistance in ADL, drug complications, the need to use a non-standard drug regimen and more than three non-chest comorbidities.A significant readmission rate was found in these patients and potential risk factors were identified. Ambulatory treatment for TB may not be appropriate for selected patients. Local guidelines for the management of TB patients at high risk of readmission is needed.},

  Abstract                 = {Vaccine safety is increasingly a major aspect of immunization programmes. Parents are becoming more aware of safety issues relating to vaccines their babies might receive. As a consequence, public health initiatives have had to take note of pressures brought to bear by individual parents and groups. Now we document a new phase in vaccine safety where it has been used to achieve political objectives. In 1988, the World Health Assembly declared its intention to eradicate poliomyelitis from the globe by the year 2000. This goal had to be postponed to 2005 for a number of reasons. Although the progress has been spectacular in achieving eradication in almost all nations and areas, the goal has been tantalizingly elusive. But arguably the most difficult country from which to eradicate the virus has been Nigeria. Over the past two years, tension has arisen in the north against immunizing against polio using the oral polio vaccine (OPV). Although this vaccine has been used in every other country in the world including other Muslim states, some religious leaders in the north found reason in August 2003 to advise their followers not to have their children vaccinated with OPV. Subsequent to this boycott, which the Kano governor had endorsed for a year and then ended in July 2004, cases of polio occurred in African nations previously free of the virus, and the DNA finger-print of the virus indicated it had come from Nigeria. In other words, Nigeria became a net exporter of polio virus to its African neighbours and beyond. Now the disease has spread to a dozen formerly polio-free countries, including Sudan and Indonesia. We show that, while the outward manifestations of the northern Nigerian intransigence were that of distrust of vaccine, the underlying problem was actually part of a longstanding dispute about political and religious power vis a vis Abuja. It is unlikely that polio transmission will be interrupted by 2005 if this dispute is allowed to run its course.},

In approximately half the countries where resistance has been reported, estimates are based on surveys conducted in public sector facilities. However, in locations where a substantial fraction of TB cases seek care with private providers, these surveys may not accurately measure resistance in the entire population.We describe a mathematical model to investigate biases associated with sampling only from public sector cases in India, where TB treatment is offered in both public and private sectors. We then propose and demonstrate a weighted estimator as an efficient method for including small numbers of cases from the private sector as a way to recover valid estimates of resistance in the population under study.We find that public sector surveys rarely provide valid estimates of drug-resistance among new and retreatment cases. Further, the magnitude and direction of the bias are sensitive to many parameters describing the health-seeking behaviours and treatment outcomes of tuberculosis patients, disallowing simple adjustments to recover accurate estimates.In locations where large numbers of tuberculosis patients are diagnosed and treated by private sector practitioners who are not typically included in drug resistance surveys, targeted surveys for assessing drug resistance are required to validly estimate resistance.},

Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for HIV-TB coinfected individuals reduces the reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections and is being evaluated as a potential community-wide strategy for improving TB control. We developed a mathematical model of TB/HIV coepidemics to examine the impact of community-wide implementation of IPT for TB-HIV coinfected individuals on the dynamics of drug-sensitive and -resistant TB epidemics. We found that community-wide IPT will reduce the incidence of TB in the short-term but may also speed the emergence of drug-resistant TB. We conclude that community-wide IPT in areas of emerging HIV and drug-resistant TB should be coupled with diagnostic and treatment policies designed to identify and effectively treat the increasing proportion of patients with drug-resistant TB.},

While antibiotic resistance is cited as a potential threat to efforts aimed at controlling the spread of this pathogen, it is not clear how drug resistance affects disease dynamics. The effect of mutational events that lead to antibiotic-resistant phenotypes may or may not have a predictable effect on the fitness of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains. Here, we review the literature on laboratory studies of the fitness of drug-resistant tuberculosis, we examine the evidence from cluster studies, and we consider the effect of drug resistance on disease dynamics in mathematical models. On the basis of these diverse lines of evidence, we conclude that the fitness estimates of drug-resistant M tuberculosis are quite heterogeneous and that this variation may preclude our ability to predict future trends of this pathogen.},

When investigating the resurgence of TB it is very important epidemiologically to take into account the influence of AIDS prevalence on TB. This paper develops a procedure establishing HIV prevalence in TB for people in Armenia, Quindío, by using a mathematical model. This was done by building two deterministic models and relating them through a linear transfer function model. To parameters involved in these models had to be estimated to relate them; a technique was then built from unbiased estimators of minimum variance and secondary information for the parameters of each disease, taking into account the town's Secretariat of Health's secondary information. The model for Armenia led to concluding that tuberculosis resulted from people who had suffered from tuberculosis 4 periods (trimesters) ago and those sick from AIDS 2 periods ago, including the present. The procedure described in this work was seen to be applicable to the pathologies to which it is related.},

As expected, HIV is a key driver of TB epidemics and affects their age-distribution and their scale. The level of development of a country and its wealth also vary with the shape and scale of a country's TB epidemic. Immigration has an influence on the shape of TB epidemics, which is particularly pronounced in highly developed countries with low levels of TB disease in the native population.

The model is used to compare the effectiveness of TB chemotherapy with three strategies for prevention: highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the treatment of latent TB infection (TLTI) and the reduction of HIV transmission.Even where the prevalence of HIV infection is high, finding and curing active TB is the most effective way to minimize the number of TB cases and deaths over the next 10 years. HAART can be as effective, but only with very high levels of coverage and compliance. TLTI is comparatively ineffective over all time scales. Reducing HIV incidence is relatively ineffective in preventing TB and TB deaths over 10 years but is much more effective over 20 years.In countries where the spread of HIV has led to a substantial increase in the incidence of TB, TB control programmes should maintain a strong emphasis on the treatment of active TB. To ensure effective control of TB in the longer term, methods of TB prevention should be carried out in addition to, but not as a substitute for, treating active cases.},

  Abstract                 = {To detail clinical and polysomnographic characteristics in patients affected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (Tb.g.) human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) at different stages of evolution and to measure and compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of hypocretin-1 with narcoleptic patients and neurologic controls.Twenty-five untreated patients affected with T.b.g. HAT were included. The patients were evaluated using a standardized clinical evaluation and a specific interview on sleep complaints. Diagnosis of stages I and II and intermediate stage was performed by CSF cell count and/or presence of trypanosomes: 4 patients were classified as stage II, 13 stage I, and 8 "intermediate" stage. Seventeen untreated patients completed continuous 24-hour polysomnography. We measured CSF levels of hypocretin-1 in all patients at different stages and evolutions, and we compared the results with 26 patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy and 53 neurologic controls.CSF hypocretin-1 levels were significantly higher in T.b.g. HAT (423.2 +/- 119.7 pg/mL) than in narcoleptic patients (40.16 +/- 60.18 pg/ mL) but lower than in neurologic controls (517.32 +/- 194.5 pg/mL). One stage I patient had undetectable hypocretin levels and 1 stage II patient showed intermediate levels, both patients (out of three patients) reporting excessive daytime sleepiness but without evidence for an association with narcolepsy. No differences were found in CSF hypocretin levels between patients with HAT stages; however, the presence of major sleep-wake cycle disruptions was significantly associated with lower CSF hypocretin-1 level with a same tendency for the number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods.The present investigation is not in favor of a unique implication of the hypocretin system in T.b.g. HAT. However, we propose that dysfunction of the hypothalamic hypocretin region may participate in sleep disturbances observed in African trypanosomiasis.},

  abstract    = {Tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) may be negative in the absence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) or in the presence of active tuberculosis (TB). The same phenomenon likely holds for interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs).A mathematical model of LTBI test specificity was developed using elementary probability theory. Implications for IGRA study design, and data collection and analysis are presented.The model demonstrates that the specificity of any test for LTBI is theoretically affected by its sensitivity to active TB, and by the distribution of TB, LTBI and healthy controls. Moreover, changing cut-off points to increase the sensitivity for active TB will cause a decline in the specificity for LTBI. Published data are used to demonstrate these counterintuitive results.As a result of the markedly dissimilar health statuses associated with a negative LTBI test, IGRA specificity for LTBI and sensitivity to active TB depend upon TB and LTBI prevalence. A trade-off exists between the specificity of IGRAs to LTBI and sensitivity to active TB. Field studies of IGRAs will require standardized collection of symptoms of active TB to distinguish LTBI suspects from TB suspects. Different cut-off points for IGRA use in TB suspects and LTBI suspects will likely be needed.},

The infection had become widespread in sheep in England and Wales before this discovery. It was decided to eradicate the disease by slaughter rather than use vaccine. The virus was a Pan-Asia O strain that caused few lesions in sheep and this made the identification of infected flocks very difficult leading to a long drawn-out epidemic. Over four million animals were slaughtered in 2000 herds and flocks. The last outbreak was in September.}

However, this traditional view has been challenged recently, largely due to the evidence originating from the M. marinum-zebrafish model. As a genetically tractable model, zebrafish provide unprecedented opportunities to address the pathogenesis of tuberculosis from a systems biology perspective. The latest data from this model are summarized in this review, special attention is given to the shared pathway and network between zebrafish and humans.

In the 2 1/2-year period following initiation of the vaccination campaign in September 1980, 83\% of children in the target population were covered and no cases of paralytic poliomyelitis were reported from the area. This coverage rate of 83\% stands in contrast with the 64\% rate obtained in Bombay's Ward B, a residential area for middle and upper-income people, and the 70\% rate in Ward E, another slum district where household visits were not conducted. This experience demonstrates that it is possible to abolish paralytic poliomyelitis through adequate vaccination coverage even in slum areas located in the middle of highly endemic areas. Experience further demonstrated that it is not necessary to withhold oral polio vaccine from children with minor illnesses such as diarrhea or immediately before or after breastfeeding. These 2 contraindications have in the past increased the difficulty of obtaining adequate vaccine coverage rates among young children.},

To test the usefulness of the design rules, we consider as a case study the map-labeling problem, an NP-hard problem from cartography. We compare the predictions of the theoretical models with the actual performance of the GA for the map-labeling problem. Experiments show that the predictions match the observed scale-up behavior of the GA, thereby strengthening our claim that the design rules can guide the design of competent selecto-recombinative GAs for realistic problems.},

  Abstract                 = {In vitro interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) assays have emerged as novel alternatives to the tuberculin skin test (TST) for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. These assays have been evaluated in low incidence countries, mainly in adults, and have been shown to be more specific than TST. Because few studies have been done in high incidence countries, and because paediatric data are limited, we compared a whole-blood IFN-gamma assay with TST among hospitalized Indian children.Between July 2004 and June 2005, a total of 105 consecutively admitted children (median age 6 years; 82\% had BCG scars) in whom TB was suspected or had history of contact with an index case were recruited at a rural hospital in India. All children underwent TST, and the QuantiFERON-TB-Gold In Tube (QFT) assay.The overall prevalence of TB infection was similar with both tests. With a TST cut-off point of > or =10mm, 10 of 105 (9.5\%; 95\% CI 3.8, 15.2) children were TST positive. With a cut-off point of IFN-gamma> or =0.35IU/ml, 11 of 105 (10.5\%; 95\% CI 4.5, 16.4) were QFT positive. The concordance between TST and QFT was substantial (agreement 95.2\%; kappa [kappa] 0.73; 95\% CI for kappa 0.53, 0.92). Agreement between TST and QFT results was 100\% (kappa 1.0) in BCG scar-negative children as compared to 94\% (kappa 0.63) in scar-positive children. BCG was not associated with the results of either TST or QFT (P>0.05 for both tests). The number of children with bacteriologically confirmed active TB was too small to permit the estimation of sensitivity of the tests.In a rural, predominantly BCG-vaccinated paediatric population in India, the TST and QFT assay produced comparable results. BCG vaccination did not significantly affect either TST or QFT results. Larger studies are needed to compare the sensitivity of the IFN-gamma assay with that of the TST in children with bacteriologically and/or clinically confirmed TB.},

  Abstract                 = {The transmission of tuberculosis is a recognized risk in health-care settings. Several recent outbreaks of tuberculosis in health-care settings, including outbreaks involving multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have heightened concern about nosocomial transmission. In addition, increases in tuberculosis cases in many areas are related to the high risk of tuberculosis among persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Transmission of tuberculosis to persons with HIV infection is of particular concern because they are at high risk of developing active tuberculosis if infected. Health-care workers should be particularly alert to the need for preventing tuberculosis transmission in settings in which persons with HIV infection receive care, especially settings in which cough-inducing procedures (e.g., sputum induction and aerosolized pentamidine [AP] treatments) are being performed. Transmission is most likely to occur from patients with unrecognized pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis who are not on effective antituberculosis therapy and have not been placed in tuberculosis (acid-fast bacilli [AFB]) isolation. Health-care facilities in which persons at high risk for tuberculosis work or receive care should periodically review their tuberculosis policies and procedures, and determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk of tuberculosis transmission in their particular settings. The prevention of tuberculosis transmission in health-care settings requires that all of the following basic approaches be used: a) prevention of the generation of infectious airborne particles (droplet nuclei) by early identification and treatment of persons with tuberculous infection and active tuberculosis, b) prevention of the spread of infectious droplet nuclei into the general air circulation by applying source-control methods, c) reduction of the number of infectious droplet nuclei in air contaminated with them, and d) surveillance of health-care-facility personnel for tuberculosis and tuberculous infection. Experience has shown that when inadequate attention is given to any of these approaches, the probability of tuberculosis transmission is increased. Specific actions to reduce the risk of tuberculosis transmission should include a) screening patients for active tuberculosis and tuberculous infection, b) providing rapid diagnostic services, c) prescribing appropriate curative and preventive therapy, d) maintaining physical measures to reduce microbial contamination of the air, e) providing isolation rooms for persons with, or suspected of having, infectious tuberculosis, f) screening health-care-facility personnel for tuberculous infection and tuberculosis, and g) promptly investigating and controlling outbreaks. Although completely eliminating the risk of tuberculosis transmission in all health-care settings may be impossible, adhering to these guidelines should minimize the risk to persons in these settings.},

  Abstract                 = {On the basis of studies from developed countries, the case-fatality ratio (CFR) of poliomyelitis generally ranges from 2\%-5\% among children <5 years of age to 10\%-30\% among adults. However, little information is available for poliomyelitis-related CFR in developing countries. We conducted a study to determine the CFR in India, 1 of the 4 remaining countries with endemic wild poliovirus (WPV) circulation, during outbreaks of WPV infection during 2002 and 2006 and during the inter-epidemic years of 2003-2005.We conducted a descriptive analysis with use of data from the acute flaccid paralysis surveillance system in India. Variables analyzed included age, caregiver-reported vaccination status, date of paralysis onset, laboratory results, final case classification, and survival outcome. Our analysis also accounted for surveillance changes that occurred in 2005, impacting case definitions and final classification.In 2006, 45 deaths occurred among 676 WPV cases in India, yielding a CFR of 6.7\%. By comparison, in 2002, there were 66 deaths among 1600 reported WPV cases (CFR, 4.2\%) and during 2002-2005, CFR was 1.5\%-5.2\%. All 45 deaths were among 644 (95\%) WPV cases in children aged <5 years (CFR, 7.0\%). Among those who died, 33 (73\%) were children aged <2 years (CFR, 7.1\%).The CFR among children aged <2 years in India is high compared with previously published CFRs for young children, in part because of improved case finding through enhanced surveillance techniques. Fatal cases emphasize the lethal nature of the disease and the importance of achieving polio eradication in India.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis (TB) is characterized by a subclinical phase (symptoms absent or not considered abnormal); prediagnostic phase (symptoms noticed but diagnosis not pursued); and clinical phase (care actively sought). Diagnostic capacity during these phases is limited.To estimate the population-level impact of TB case-finding strategies in the presence of subclinical and prediagnostic disease.We created a mathematical epidemic model of TB, calibrated to global incidence. We then introduced three prototypical diagnostic interventions: increased sensitivity of diagnosis in the clinical phase by 20\% ("passive"); early diagnosis during the prediagnostic phase at a rate of 10\% per year ("enhanced"); and population-based diagnosis of 5\% of undiagnosed prevalent cases per year ("active").If the subclinical phase was ignored, as in most models, the passive strategy was projected to reduce TB incidence by 18\% (90\% uncertainty range [UR], 11-32\%) by year 10, compared with 23\% (90\% UR, 14-35\%) for the enhanced strategy and 18\% (90\% UR, 11-28\%) for the active strategy. After incorporating a subclinical phase into the model, consistent with population-based prevalence surveys, the active strategy still reduced 10-year TB incidence by 16\% (90\% UR, 11-28\%), but the passive and enhanced strategies' impact was attenuated to 11\% (90\% UR, 8-25\%) and 6\% (90\% UR, 4-13\%), respectively. The degree of attenuation depended strongly on the transmission rate during the subclinical phase.Subclinical disease may limit the impact of current diagnostic strategies for TB. Active detection of undiagnosed prevalent cases may achieve greater population-level TB control than increasing passive case detection.},

Expanding access to culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) for TB diagnosis may help control this epidemic, but the potential impact of existing and novel TB diagnostics is uncertain. By fitting to World Health Organization epidemiological estimates, we developed a compartmental difference-equation model of the TB/HIV epidemic among South African adults. Performing culture and DST in 37\% of new cases and 85\% of previously treated cases was projected to save 47,955 lives (17.2\% reduction in TB mortality, 95\% simulation interval (S.I.) 8.9-24.4\%), avert 7,721 MDR-TB cases (14.1\% reduction, 95\% S.I. 5.3-23.8\%), and prevent 46.6\% of MDR-TB deaths (95\% S.I. 32.6-56.0\%) in South Africa over 10 years. Used alone, expanded culture and DST did not reduce XDR-TB incidence, but they enhanced the impact of transmission-reduction strategies, such as respiratory isolation. In South Africa, expanding TB culture and DST could substantially reduce TB, and particularly MDR-TB, mortality. Control of XDR-TB will require additional interventions, the impact of which may be enhanced by improved TB diagnosis.},

  Abstract                 = {To explore the potential impact of enhanced tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic techniques as a TB control strategy in an adult population with high HIV prevalence.A compartmental difference-equation model of TB/HIV was developed using parameter estimates from the literature.The impact of five TB control interventions (rapid molecular testing, mycobacterial culture, community-wide and HIV-targeted active case finding, and highly active antiretroviral therapy) on TB incidence, prevalence, and mortality was modeled in a steady-state population with an HIV prevalence of 17\% and annual TB incidence of 409 per 100 000. Sensitivity analyses assessed the influence of each model parameter on the interventions' mortality impact.Enhanced diagnostic techniques (rapid molecular testing or culture) are each projected to reduce TB prevalence and mortality by 20\% or more, an impact similar to that of active case-finding in 33\% of the general community and greater than the effect achievable by case-finding or antiretroviral treatment efforts in HIV-positive patients alone. The projected impact of enhanced diagnostics on TB incidence (< 10\% reduction) is smaller. The impact of TB diagnostics is sensitive to the quality of existing diagnostic standards and the level of access to diagnostic services, but is robust across a wide range of population parameters including HIV and TB incidence.Enhanced TB diagnostic techniques may have substantial impact on TB morbidity and mortality in HIV-endemic regions. As TB rates continue to increase in these areas, enhanced diagnostic techniques merit further consideration as TB control strategies.},

At pH 5.5 there are six specific Gd(III)-binding sites on the IgG. These six sites can be divided into two classes; two very 'tight' sites on the Fc fragment (Kd approx. 5 muM) and two weaker sites on each Fab region (Kd approx. 140 muM). Ca(II) does not apparently compete for these metal-binding sites. The metal-binding parameters for IgG can be explained as the sum of the metal binding to the isolated Fab and Fc fragments, suggesting that there is no apparent interaction between the Fab and Fc regions in the IgG molecule. The binding of Gd(III) to Fab and Fc fragments was also monitored by measuring changes in the electron-spin-resonance spectrum of Gd(III) in the presence of each fragment and also by monitoring the effects of Gd(III) on the protein fluorescence at 340 nm (excitation 295 nm). The fluorescence of Tb(III) solutions of 545 nm (excitation 295 nm) is enhanced slightly on addition of Fab or Fc.},

Inequities in cervical cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment and HPV vaccination may arise from a number of barriers including access to healthcare, cultural beliefs, and limited awareness of options.Initiatives to promote uptake of prophylactic HPV vaccination that target high-risk women need to be implemented before existing disparities widen. Although acceptability of HPV vaccination is promising, uptake is still low among low-income populations and specific racial/ethnic minorities. To address limited vaccine uptake it may be beneficial to establish national/state guidelines as well as culturally relevant interventions at the individual and community levels. The successful implementation of multiple integrated initiatives on HPV awareness, knowledge, and vaccination will diminish existing disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality.},

Features of vaccination are discussed, including the long persistence of humoral antibodies and long duration of effective protection. The possibility of changes in virulence of yellow fever strains is mentioned. In some of the modern outbreaks, virulence for human beings appears to be lower than virulence noted some centuries ago, and a hypothesis is advanced. The possible influence of virus-protecting antibodies acquired by infection by other flaviviruses is mentioned. With respect to the vectors of yellow fever, the possibility of differing susceptibility and of different behaviour of various strains is discussed. Transovarial transmission of the virus in the vector mosquito is mentioned as a possible mechanism for long persistence of the virus in nature. Infection of ticks and transovarial transmission of virus in ticks are also mentioned. The need for a diagnostic test to differentiate immunity produced by a naturally acquired infection from immunity induced by vaccination is stressed.},

  Abstract                 = {The results of a study on the epidemiology of airborne (aerobic) surgical infections are presented. The first phase of the study was carried out in a surgical suite which contained no environmental or traffic control systems. The second phase of the study took place within a modern "up to date" operating room suite containing multiple air screens as well as an elaborate ventilation system utilizing HEPA type filters which provided the operating room with clinically sterile air. One hundred and fifty-six patients were also studied. All patients underwent major procedures. The ratio of clean, clean-contaminated, and dirty cases was the same in both groups. Preoperatively, a nasal swab, clean voided urine (or vaginal swab) and a rectal swab were obtained on each patient. Daily nasal cultures and cultures of suspected sites of infection were obtained postoperatively. Daily nasal cultures and "glove sweat" cultures were obtained on all personnel attending the patient. Environmental cultures of the operating room, the operating room hallway, recovery room and patients' rooms were also taken. All samples were checked for the presence of staphylococci, streptococci, Escherichia coli, proteus species, enterobacter, klebsiella, and pseudomonas. In all, 15,000 cultures were taken during the study. The rate of infection was essentially the same in both phases of the study. Environmental air only occasionaly served as the source of infecting organisms. The results of the study support the conclusion that the most common source of infecting organisms in surgical infections is thepatient or those around him. The most common time of contamination is during the surgical procedure itself. Surgical infections can best be minimized by meticulous observation of fundamental principles of antisepsis rather than by dependence on elaborate and costly ventilation and air control systems.},

Approaches are required to minimize the increase in resistant strains, such as good antibiotic stewardship and the limiting of antibiotic use to appropriate circumstances. There are instances when drug dose and/or schedule can be used to minimize the probability that mutants will take over the bacterial population. Over the past several years, significant advances have been made in understanding the relationship between drug concentrations and amplification of resistant mutant subpopulations. In this review, we examine the use of preclinical models for facilitating this understanding. We also use mathematical techniques, including Monte Carlo simulation, to bridge between the identification of exposures to minimize resistance and the examination of candidate drug doses to achieve this end. Examples are provided for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In each instance, quinolone antimicrobials were examined. More investigations with other pathogens and drug classes are required.},

  abstract    = {Use of the old antipsychotic phenothiazine thioridazine (THZ) for therapy of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) infection is now being seriously considered. It is reported that THZ primarily acts on enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and membrane proteins, particularly efflux pumps, as well as oxidoreductases and proteins involved in aerobic respiration that overlap with a number of conventional antituberculous drugs. It targets the products of the Rv3160c-Rv3161c operon, which are perhaps required for the detoxification of THZ, members of the sigma factor SigB regulon that play a crucial role in protecting the pathogen against cell envelope damage, and Rv2745c, a transcription factor that regulates ATP-dependent proteolysis. Some of these genes have been shown to be essential for the survival or persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the infected host. Since THZ targets multiple pathways, including those involved in cell wall processes and respiratory chain components, it may serve as a model for multi-target drug development, as well as constitute a highly potent addition to a combination of antituberculous drug regimens. The discussion of some of the patents relevant to thioridazine to combat tuberculosis is also included in the present manuscript.},

  Abstract                 = {A quantitative structure activity relationship study was performed on different groups of anti-tuberculosis drug compound for establishing quantitative relationship between biological activity and their physicochemical /structural properties. In recent years, a large number of herbal drugs are promoted in treatment of tuberculosis especially due to the emergence of MDR (multi drug resistance) and XDR (extensive drug resistance) tuberculosis. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is resistant to front-line drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin, the most powerful anti-TB drugs) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is resistant to front-line and second-line drugs. The possibility of drug resistance TB increases when patient does not take prescribed drugs for defined time period. Natural products (secondary metabolites) isolated from the variety of sources including terrestrial and marine plants and animals, and microorganisms, have been recognized as having antituberculosis action and have recently been tested preclinically for their growth inhibitory activity towards Mycobacterium tuberculosis or related organisms. A quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies were performed to explore the antituberculosis compound from the derivatives of natural products . Theoretical results are in accord with the in vitro experimental data with reported growth inhibitory activity towards Mycobacterium tuberculosis or related organisms. Antitubercular activity was predicted through QSAR model, developed by forward feed multiple linear regression method with leave-one-out approach. Relationship correlating measure of QSAR model was 74\% (R(2) = 0.74) and predictive accuracy was 72\% (RCV(2) = 0.72). QSAR studies indicate that dipole energy and heat of formation correlate well with anti-tubercular activity. These results could offer useful references for understanding mechanisms and directing the molecular design of new lead compounds with improved anti-tubercular activity. The generated QSAR model revealed the importance of structural, thermodynamic and electro topological parameters. The quantitative structure activity relationship provides important structural insight in designing of potent antitubercular agent.},

Refined behavioural and epidemiological models should be able to investigate the mechanisms by which early diagnosis could be achieved, in addition to the consequent epidemiological effects.},

In monitoring progress in tuberculosis control, the ultimate aim for all countries is to count tuberculosis cases (incidence) accurately through routine surveillance. Disease prevalence surveys are costly and laborious, but give unbiased measures of tuberculosis burden and trends, and are justified in high-burden countries where many cases and deaths are missed by surveillance systems. Most countries in which tuberculosis is highly endemic do not yet have reliable death registration systems. Verbal autopsy, used in cause-of-death surveys, is an alternative, interim method of assessing tuberculosis mortality, but needs further validation. Although several new assays for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have recently been devised, the tuberculin skin test remains the only practical method of measuring infection in populations. However, this test typically has low specificity and is therefore best used comparatively to assess geographical and temporal variation in risk of infection. By 2015, every country should be able to assess progress in tuberculosis control by estimating the time trend in incidence, and the magnitude of reductions in either prevalence or deaths.},

  Abstract                 = {The discovery of high prevalences of antibiotic resistance in some pathogens, in some parts of the world, has provoked fears of a widespread loss of drug efficacy. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate the evolution of resistance to four major anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin) in 47 sites around the world. The model provides a new method of estimating the relative risk of treatment failure for patients carrying drug-resistant strains and the proportion of patients who develop resistance after failing treatment. Using estimates of these two quantities together with other published data, we reconstructed the epidemic spread of isoniazid resistance over the past 50 years. The predicted median prevalence of resistance among new cases today was 7.0\% (range 0.9-64.3\%), close to the 6.3\% (range 0-28.1\%) observed. Predicted and observed prevalences of resistance to isoniazid plus rifampicin (multidrug-resistant or MDR-TB) after 30 years of combined drug use were also similar, 0.9\% (0.1-5.9\%) and 1.0\% (range 0-14.1\%), respectively. With current data, and under prevailing treatment practices, it appears that MDR-TB will remain a localized problem, rather than becoming a global obstacle to tuberculosis control. To substantiate this result, further measurements are needed of the relative fitness of drug-resistant strains.},

Estimates derived from relatively poor data were strongly influenced by panel member opinion. Objective estimates were derived from high-quality data collected recently by approved procedures.Agreement was reached by (1) participants reviewing methods and data and making provisional estimates in closed workshops held at WHO's 6 regional offices, (2) principal authors refining estimates using standard methods and all available data, and (3) country experts reviewing and adjusting these estimates and reaching final agreement with WHO staff.In 1997, new cases of TB totaled an estimated 7.96 million (range, 6.3 million-11.1 million), including 3.52 million (2.8 million-4.9 million) cases (44\%) of infectious pulmonary disease (smear-positive), and there were 16.2 million (12.1 million-22.5 million) existing cases of disease. An estimated 1.87 million (1.4 million-2.8 million) people died of TB and the global case fatality rate was 23\% but exceeded 50\% in some African countries with high HIV rates. Global prevalence of MTB infection was 32\% (1.86 billion people). Eighty percent of all incident TB cases were found in 22 countries, with more than half the cases occurring in 5 Southeast Asian countries. Nine of 10 countries with the highest incidence rates per capita were in Africa. Prevalence of MTB/HIV coinfection worldwide was 0.18\% and 640000 incident TB cases (8\%) had HIV infection. The global burden of tuberculosis remains enormous, mainly because of poor control in Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern Europe, and because of high rates of M tuberculosis and HIV coinfection in some African countries.},

  Abstract                 = {To examine the impact of HIV on infectiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).A cross-sectional tuberculin survey carried out among household contacts of HIV-1-positive and negative patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB. Contacts were also examined for active TB.Index cases were recruited from patients attending the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia and household contacts were examined during visits to their homes within Lusaka.A total of 207 contacts of 43 HIV-positive patients, and 141 contacts of 28 HIV-negative patients with pulmonary TB were examined.Proportion of contacts of HIV-positive and negative index cases with a positive tuberculin response (diameter of induration > or = 5 mm to a dose of 2 tuberculin units).Fifty-two per cent of contacts of HIV-positive pulmonary TB patients had a positive tuberculin response compared with 71\% of contacts of HIV-negative patients (odds ratio, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.72; P < 0.001). This difference persisted after allowing for between-household variations in the tuberculin response. Tuberculin response in the contact was related to age of contact, intimacy with the index case and crowding in the household. However, the effect of HIV status of the index case was not confounded by these variables. Tuberculin response in the contact was also related to the number of bacilli seen in the sputum smear of the index case which partially explained the effect of HIV status of the index case. Active TB was diagnosed in 4\% of contacts of HIV-positive and 3\% of contacts of HIV-negative cases, respectively (P = 0.8).HIV-positive patients with pulmonary TB may be less infectious than their HIV-negative counterparts and this may partly be explained by lower bacillary load in the sputum.Between April and December 1989, the chest clinic of the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in 141 adults, 95 (67\%) of whom were HIV-1 seropositive. Health workers made home visits to 71 of the index cases (43 HIV-1 positive and 28 HIV-1 negative) to learn whether the 348 household members would also develop TB, thus allowing researchers to determine the effect of HIV on infectiousness of TB. Contacts of HIV-1 positive patients developed TB at a lower rate than did those of HIV-1 negative patients (52\% vs. 71\%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.43; p .001). This difference continued even after controlling for between-household variations, indicating that confounding variables did not account for the difference. Age of contact, intimacy with the index case, and crowding in the household were associated with the tuberculin response in the contact, but they did not confound the effect of HIV status. Tuberculin response in the contact was associated with the number of bacilli in the sputum smear (crude OR = 3.13; p = .013, and adjusted OR =1.84; p = .28), suggesting that the number of bacilli somewhat explained the difference in infectiousness between HIV-1 positive and HIV-1 negative patients. 12 contacts (8 of HIV-positive cases and 4 of HIV-negative cases) developed active TB after the TB diagnosis in the index case. These findings clearly demonstrated that infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis was less likely in household members of HIV-1 positive cases than in those of HIV-1 negative cases. The lower bacillary load in the sputum in HIV- 1 cases may have accounted somewhat for the lower infectiousness of pulmonary TB.},

Trimmed versions of meta-analytic estimators for the risk difference, adapted from procedures designed for a random-effects analysis, can resist the impact of a few anomalous studies. A simulation study compared untrimmed and trimmed versions of four meta-analytic procedures that give weighted averages of risk differences. An adaptation of Winsorized estimates of components of variance gains some resistance to anomalous studies when estimating variability. The simulations found that a modified version of the DerSimonian-Laird estimator is attractive when risk differences reveal the added variability described by a random-effects model, and that a 20 per cent trimmed, weighted version of this procedure offers resistance against the impact of highly anomalous results. Among four trimmed procedures considered, the trimmed version of the modified DerSimonian-Laird estimator offers the best performance over a wide range of simulation designs and sample sizes. None of the methods, whether trimmed or untrimmed, is uniformly preferable. A published meta-analysis of a vaccination against TB provides data that serve to illustrate differences among the eight procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug-resistant tuberculosis has been reported since the early days of the introduction of chemotherapy. However, most of the evidence was limited to developed countries. In 1992, the Third World Congress on Tuberculosis concluded that there was little recent information on the global magnitude of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. Through the WHO/IUATLD Global Project on Drug-Resistance Surveillance launched in 1994, a large number of reliable and accurate data have allowed us to understand the magnitude of the problem of MDR-TB. The data available suggest that globally MDR-TB is not a problem (median = 1\% in 64 countries/geographical sites surveyed) of the same magnitude as that of drug-susceptible tuberculosis. However, MDR-TB is at critical levels in specific regions of the world. Hot spots for MDR-TB include Estonia, Latvia, the Oblasts of Ivanovo and Tomsk in Russia, and the provinces of Henan and Zhejiang Provinces in China. Trends confirm that MDR-TB is limited to local epidemics but the evidence is not yet irrefutable, as many countries have only provided short-term data. Two-thirds of the world's countries and, more importantly, half of the 22 tuberculosis high-burden countries, have not yet provided data. Mathematical modelling suggests that 3.2\% (or 273,000) of the world's estimated new tuberculosis cases (95\% confidence intervals: 185,000 and 414,000) were MDR-TB in 2000. Adoption of DOTS to prevent the generation of resistant strains and careful introduction of second-line drugs to treat patients with MDR are the top priorities for proper control/containment of MDR-TB.},

  Abstract                 = {Paediatric multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis is a public health challenge of growing concern, accounting for an estimated 15\% of all global cases of MDR tuberculosis. Clinical management is especially challenging, and recommendations are based on restricted evidence. We aimed to assess existing evidence for the treatment of MDR tuberculosis in children.We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies reporting treatment outcomes for children with MDR tuberculosis. We searched PubMed, Ovid, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO, and BioMedCentral databases up to Oct 31, 2011. Eligible studies included five or more children (aged ≤16 years) with MDR tuberculosis within a defined treatment cohort. The primary outcome was treatment success, defined as a composite of cure and treatment completion.We identified eight studies, which reported treatment outcomes for a total of 315 patients. We recorded much variation in the characteristics of patients and programmes. Time to appropriate treatment varied from 2 days to 46 months. Average duration of treatment ranged from 6 months to 34 months, and duration of follow-up ranged from 12 months to 37 months. The pooled estimate for treatment success was 81·67\% (95\% CI 72·54-90·80). Across all studies, 5·9\% (95\% CI 1·3-10·5) died, 6·2\% (2·3-10·2) defaulted, and 39·1\% (28·7-49·4) had an adverse event. The most common drug-related adverse events were nausea and vomiting. Other serious adverse events were hearing loss, psychiatric effects, and hypothyroidism.The treatment of paediatric MDR tuberculosis has been neglected, but when children are treated outcomes can be achieved that are at least as good as those reported for adults. Programmes should be encouraged to report outcomes in children to improve the knowledge base for care, especially as new drugs become available.None.},

  Abstract                 = {To examine the effects on LDL cholesterol of the combined use of statins and phytosterols/-stanols, in vivo studies and clinical trials are necessary. However, for a better interpretation of the experimental data as well as to possibly predict cholesterol levels given a certain dosing regimen of statins and phytosterols/-stanols a more theoretically based approach is helpful. This study aims to construct a mathematical model to simulate reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in persons who combine the use of statins with a high intake of phytosterols/-stanols, e.g. by the use of functional foods.The proposed model includes the cholesterol pool size in the liver and serum levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. Both an additional and a multiplicative effect of phytosterol/-stanol intake on LDL cholesterol reduction were predicted from the model. The additional effect relates to the decrease of dietary cholesterol uptake reduction, the multiplicative effect relates to the decrease in enterohepatic recycling efficiency, causing increased cholesterol elimination through bile. From the model, it was demonstrated that a daily intake of 2 g phytosterols/-stanols reduces LDL cholesterol level by about 8\% to 9\% on top of the reduction resulting from statin use. The additional decrease in LDL cholesterol caused by phytosterol/-stanol use at the recommended level of 2 g/d appeared to be similar or even greater than the decrease achieved by doubling the statin dose.We proposed a simplified mathematical model to simulate the reduction in LDL cholesterol after separate and combined intake of statins and functional foods acting on intestinal (re)absorption of cholesterol or bile acids in humans. In future work, this model can be extended to include more complex (regulatory) mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death globally. TB had been considered conquered in Europe but has re-emerged as a significant problem, partly because of poor TB control programs and the link with HIV infection, migrants and other vulnerable populations, but also because a mood of complacency led to declining investment in research and public health infrastructure. In the European Union (EU), efforts initiated by the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC) now assess how research can better inform policy development and indicate the gaps and uncertainties in the scientific evidence base. A growing number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains are now resistant to the first-line anti-TB drugs, necessitating use of second-line drugs which are more expensive, less effective and more toxic. The presence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB in the EU illustrates that there are problems with TB management and control. In the EU, the aggregated rate of notified TB is approximately 18 cases per 100,000 population (range 4-120 cases/100,000 in different Member States). The highest rates are found in Eastern European countries. Only about half of EU countries routinely perform drug susceptibility testing linked to notification of TB cases. It is important for the European Commission (EC) to network regional reference laboratories to support molecular epidemiology and exchange of data via creation of interactive international databases of Mtb genotypic and phenotypic information. EU countries should help develop TB laboratory services by investing in training and provision of assistance to maintain quality control in neighbouring Eastern European countries. Improved TB care necessitates research across the spectrum to include fundamental and epidemiological science, research and development (R&D) for new drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, and operational research. Total R&D investment in TB by the EC and Member States is low by comparison with the USA despite Europe being on the frontline of the epidemic. Thus, alternative funding models for targeting TB research priorities by the EU are required. Increasing the visibility of TB as a priority issue for the EU requires the scientific community, with the academies of science, as appropriate, to communicate to politicians, healthcare providers, funders and the public at large about the current threat posed by drug-resistant TB. Any global strategy for TB control must also take into account measures to address the social, environmental and economic issues which are inextricably linked with TB. The academies conclude that, overall, the EU has failed so far to respond sufficiently to the global TB threat but can still draw on considerable strengths in its science. The EU also has a humanitarian responsibility to support TB control in developing countries. It remains very important for the EC that neither biomedical research nor investment in health services should become a casualty of the current economic recession.},

An increase in fluorescence of macrophages incubated with varying concentrations of fluorescein isothiocyanate or Tb-DOTA-tuftsin/pentapeptide conjugates was observed in a concentration-dependent manner. Tb-DOTA-pentapeptide had a greater affinity to macrophages than Tb-DOTA-tuftsin. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation strengthened the internalization of peptide conjugates by macrophages through the tuftsin receptor mechanism. Tb-DOTA-tuftsin/pentapeptide conjugates are likely to be a promising optical reagents as probes of the immune response with involvement of macrophage cells in a variety of diseases. Gd-DOTA-tuftsin conjugate was also evaluated as a cell-specific contrast agent in in vitro MRI experiments. In this context, the macrophages labelled by Gd-DOTA-tuftsin were highly magnetic and detectable by MRI, which confirms that this vectorized MRI probe has the potential to image macrophage-mediated inflammation in diseases like brain traumas and stroke. Tuftsin receptor-specific biological-function domain may have a modified in vivo biodistribution profile, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics subsequent to its conjugation to a metal ion-binding backbone.},

  Abstract                 = {Regional differences in vaccination uptake are common in both developed and developing countries, and are often linked to the availability of healthcare services and socioeconomic factors. In 2007, 0.9 million eligible Indonesian children missed measles vaccination, and 19 456 cases of measles were documented among Indonesian children. The authors investigated rural-urban differentials in measles vaccination coverage among young Indonesian children, and sought to identify key factors influencing the probability of a child receiving the first dose of measles vaccination in Indonesia.Data used in the analyses were sourced from the nationally representative Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey 2007. The influence of location of residence, household wealth, maternal and paternal education, total children ever born and use of skilled birth attendants on measles vaccination coverage was investigated using bivariate analysis and chi-square tests. The independent effects of these variables were established using binomial logistic regression analysis.Indonesia's 2007 first-dose measles national vaccination coverage was, at 72.8\%, lower than the 2008 global first-dose measles vaccination average coverage of 82\%. Bivariate analysis revealed that the first-dose measles vaccination coverage in rural areas of Indonesia was 68.5\%, compared with 80.1\% in urban regions (p < 0.001). The apparent significance of rural residence in impairing vaccination coverage was marginal after controlling for the sex of the child, maternal age, maternal and paternal education, wealth, and access to skilled health workers.Apart from sustainable initiatives to increase measles vaccination coverage globally, it is important to close the rural-urban gap in Indonesia's measles vaccination uptake. Addressing critical determinants of inferior measles vaccination coverage in Indonesia's rural regions will facilitate major improvements in Indonesia's child health trends. This article suggests initiatives for addressing three of such determinants in Indonesia's rural areas: poverty, parental education and access to skilled health workers.},

The interaction between noncommunicable and infectious diseases like TB has important implications with regard to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Smoking, diabetes mellitus, anti-TNFα drugs and other immunosuppressive therapies are well known major risk factors associated with TB. The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent literature on these risk factors and interventions that reduce the risk.Mathematical models and aggregate data from the field show that smoking, diabetes and anti-TNFα drugs independently increase the risk of developing active TB. There is consensus on the great need for screening for active TB disease in patients with these conditions and targeted preventive interventions through a combined multidisciplinary approach.Smoking, diabetes mellitus, anti-TNFα drugs and new immunosuppressive treatments represent important common risk factors for TB. A high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of TB should be considered in patients with these risk factors, and active screening and prevention should be undertaken. Further operational research is needed to optimize screening for latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, instituting preventive intervention measures.},

  Abstract                 = {To investigate the microstructural differences and responsible mechanisms in early bone formation in anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) in the spine using rhBMP-2 (INFUSE), equine bone protein extract (COLLOSS E) or autograft.Twelve Danish female landrace pigs underwent a 3-level ALIF procedure at L3-6. PEEK interbody cages packed with rhBMP-2, COLLOSS E, or autograft were inserted. The animals were divided into two groups of six, and observed for four and eight weeks postoperatively. MicroCT was performed for evaluation of microstructure of the bone within the cage. A mathematical finite element model was developed to investigate the aqueous behavior within the cages when exposed to external compressive forces.At 4 weeks postoperative bone surface volume fraction (BS/TV) using rhBMP-2 was higher than with use of COLLOSS E and autograft, while trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) was lower using rhBMP-2 at this time-point. At eight weeks BS/TV and trabecular number (Tb.N.) were still higher using rhBMP-2 than autograft and COLLOSS E. Connectivity density was significantly higher using rhBMP-2 than using autograft or COLLOSS E at both time-points. Between four- and eight-week time-points BV/TV and Tb.Th. rose while Tb.N. declined using rhBMP-2. The degree of anisotropy and the calculated amount of trabeculae with main direction along the spinal axis, were higher at four weeks using COLLOSS E. rhBMP-2 had the highest amount of trabeculae directed along the spinal axis at eight weeks. A change in main direction between four and eight weeks was observed for both autograft and rhBMP-2. The numerical results from the finite element model verify that significantly different flow pattern emerges as the boundary conditions are altered. At four weeks there was an evident correlation between trabecular orientation and flow pattern using rhBMP-2.This study reveals large differences in microstructure in the early osteogenesis and explains important mechanisms of early bone formation using rhBMP-2, COLLOSS E or autograft treatment. These differences might explain some of the unfortunate events reported such as edema, swelling, and excessive bone formation using different bone graft substitutes in spinal fusion procedures.},

We demonstrate that M. tuberculosis strains from lineage 2 (East Asian lineage and Beijing sublineage) acquire drug resistances in vitro more rapidly than M. tuberculosis strains from lineage 4 (Euro-American lineage) and that this higher rate can be attributed to a higher mutation rate. Moreover, the in vitro mutation rate correlates well with the bacterial mutation rate in humans as determined by whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates. Finally, using a stochastic mathematical model, we demonstrate that the observed differences in mutation rate predict a substantially higher probability that patients infected with a drug-susceptible lineage 2 strain will harbor multidrug-resistant bacteria at the time of diagnosis. These data suggest that interventions to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis should target bacterial as well as treatment-related risk factors.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the ecology of drug-resistant pathogens is essential for devising rational programs to preserve the effective lifespan of antimicrobial agents and to abrogate epidemics of drug-resistant organisms. Mathematical models predict that strain fitness is an important determinant of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission, but the effects of strain diversity have been largely overlooked. Here we compared the impact of resistance mutations on the transmission of isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis in San Francisco during a 9-y period. Strains with a KatG S315T or inhA promoter mutation were more likely to spread than strains with other mutations. The impact of these mutations on the transmission of isoniazid-resistant strains was comparable to the effect of other clinical determinants of transmission. Associations were apparent between specific drug resistance mutations and the main M. tuberculosis lineages. Our results show that in addition to host and environmental factors, strain genetic diversity can influence the transmission dynamics of drug-resistant bacteria.},

  Abstract                 = {Although progress has been made to reduce global incidence of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis during the past decade threatens to undermine these advances. However, countries are responding far too slowly. Of the estimated 440,000 cases of MDR tuberculosis that occurred in 2008, only 7\% were identified and reported to WHO. Of these cases, only a fifth were treated according to WHO standards. Although treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis is possible with currently available diagnostic techniques and drugs, the treatment course is substantially more costly and laborious than for drug-susceptible tuberculosis, with higher rates of treatment failure and mortality. Nonetheless, a few countries provide examples of how existing technologies can be used to reverse the epidemic of MDR tuberculosis within a decade. Major improvements in laboratory capacity, infection control, performance of tuberculosis control programmes, and treatment regimens for both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant disease will be needed, together with a massive scale-up in diagnosis and treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis to prevent drug-resistant strains from becoming the dominant form of tuberculosis. New diagnostic tests and drugs are likely to become available during the next few years and should accelerate control of MDR and XDR tuberculosis. Equally important, especially in the highest-burden countries of India, China, and Russia, will be a commitment to tuberculosis control including improvements in national policies and health systems that remove financial barriers to treatment, encourage rational drug use, and create the infrastructure necessary to manage MDR tuberculosis on a national scale.},

Recently, we reported the formulation and characterization of the nitroimidazo-oxazine PA-824 for efficient aerosol delivery as dry powder porous particles and the subsequent disposition in guinea pigs after pulmonary administration. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of these PA-824 therapeutic aerosols on the extent of TB infection in the low-inoculum aerosol infection guinea pig model. Four weeks after infection by the pulmonary route, animals received daily treatment for 4 weeks of either a high or a low dose of PA-824 dry powder aerosol. Animals received PA-824 cyclodextrin/lecithin suspensions orally as positive controls, and those receiving placebo particles or no treatment were negative controls. The lungs and spleens of animals receiving the high dose of inhaled PA-824 particles exhibited a lower degree of inflammation (indicated by wet tissue weights), bacterial burden, and tissue damage (indicated by histopathology) than those of untreated or placebo animals. Treatment with oral PA-824 cyclodextrin/lecithin suspension resulted in a more significant reduction in the bacterial burden of lungs and spleen, consistent with a dose that was larger than inhaled doses (eight times the inhaled low dose and four times the inhaled high dose). However, histopathological analysis revealed that the extent of tissue damage was comparable in groups receiving the oral or either inhaled dose. The present studies indicate the potential use of PA-824 dry powder aerosols in the treatment of TB.},

TAD is widely used in operating theaters as a surgical guideline in relation to the fixation of trochanteric fractures, and in clinical studies as a predictor of lag screw cut-out. In order to visualize better this concept, the locus of points having the same TAD was plotted and the dependence of TAD on the location of the lag screw tip was also reported. It was shown that TAD should be adjusted for the size of the femoral head (a variable which varies a lot according to the sex of the patient) while no correlation was found between TAD and bone morphometry indices obtained from micro-CT data (BV/TV and Tb.Th). Therefore, these results seem to suggest that TAD lacks mechanical justification and that predictors which are based on mechanical properties, such as bone density, should be investigated further.},

Their wall consists of a relatively thick layer of smooth muscle cells and so-called epithelioid cells. The epithelioid cell is a specialized myogenic cell phenotype expressing nitric oxide synthase. We studied the innervation of the different segments of arteriovenous anastomoses in the rabbit ear using antisera against neuropeptide Y, tyrosine hydroxylase, calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, as well as neuron-specific enolase, calbindin D and neurotubulin. The participation was especially examined of neuropeptidergic innervation and a possible morphological connection to the occurrence of epithelioid cells and a paracrine function. The NADPH diaphorase reaction and alpha-smooth muscle actin immunoelectron microscopy served to distinguish epithelioid cells from smooth muscle cells. Using conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found the most dense innervation pattern of pan-neuronal markers (neurotubulin, neuron-specific enolase), tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive nerve fibres and neuropeptidergic nerve fibres (neuropeptide Y, calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P) around the intermediate segment in arteriovenous anastomoses, whereas the venous segment was barely marked. Single nerve fibres penetrated into the medial layer and reached the epithelioid cells. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we found intercellular contacts between epithelioid cells, but not the gap junction protein connexin 43. Here, we report for the first time a correlation of the innervation pattern with epithelioid cell type in arteriovenous anastomoses. Our findings suggest that epithelioid cells of the arteriovenous anastomoses are controlled by a dense network of neuropeptidergic nerve fibres in functional connection to their paracrine role as a nitric oxide producer.},

  Abstract                 = {Detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), a frequent cause of treatment failure, takes 2 or more weeks to identify by culture. Rifampicin (RIF) resistance is a hallmark of MDR-TB, and detection of mutations in the rpoB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using molecular beacon probes with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a novel approach that takes </=2 days. However, qPCR identification of resistant isolates, particularly for isolates with mixed RIF-susceptible and RIF-resistant bacteria, is reader dependent and limits its clinical use. The aim of this study was to develop an objective, reader-independent method to define rpoB mutants using beacon qPCR. This would facilitate the transition from a research protocol to the clinical setting, where high-throughput methods with objective interpretation are required. For this, DNAs from 107 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates with known susceptibility to RIF by culture-based methods were obtained from 2 regions where isolates have not previously been subjected to evaluation using molecular beacon qPCR: the Texas-Mexico border and Colombia. Using coded DNA specimens, mutations within an 81-bp hot spot region of rpoB were established by qPCR with 5 beacons spanning this region. Visual and mathematical approaches were used to establish whether the qPCR cycle threshold of the experimental isolate was significantly higher (mutant) compared to a reference wild-type isolate. Visual classification of the beacon qPCR required reader training for strains with a mixture of RIF-susceptible and RIF-resistant bacteria. Only then had the visual interpretation by an experienced reader had 100\% sensitivity and 94.6\% specificity versus RIF resistance by culture phenotype and 98.1\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity versus mutations based on DNA sequence. The mathematical approach was 98\% sensitive and 94.5\% specific versus culture and 96.2\% sensitive and 100\% specific versus DNA sequence. Our findings indicate the mathematical approach has advantages over the visual reading, in that it uses a Microsoft Excel template to eliminate reader bias or inexperience, and allows objective interpretation from high-throughput analyses even in the presence of a mixture of RIF-resistant and RIF-susceptible isolates without the need for reader training.},

The effectiveness of screening depends on several factors, including pathogen natural history and epidemiology, human behavior, and characteristics of the source epidemic. We developed a mathematical model to understand how these factors combine to influence screening outcomes. We analyzed screening programs for six emerging pathogens in the early and late stages of an epidemic. We show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance. For pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage. However, even in the most optimistic scenario arrival screening will miss the majority of cases.},

  Abstract                 = {For millennia, humans have sought and found purpose, solace, values, understanding, and fellowship in religious practices. Buddhist nuns performed variolation against smallpox over 1000 years ago. Since Jenner developed vaccination against smallpox in 1796, some people have objected to and declined vaccination, citing various religious reasons. This paper reviews the scriptural, canonical basis for such interpretations, as well as passages that support immunization. Populous faith traditions are considered, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Subjects of concern such as blood components, pharmaceutical excipients of porcine or bovine origin, rubella strain RA 27/3, and cell-culture media with remote fetal origins are evaluated against the religious concerns identified. The review identified more than 60 reports or evaluations of vaccine-preventable infectious-disease outbreaks that occurred within religious communities or that spread from them to broader communities. In multiple cases, ostensibly religious reasons to decline immunization actually reflected concerns about vaccine safety or personal beliefs among a social network of people organized around a faith community, rather than theologically based objections per se. Themes favoring vaccine acceptance included transformation of vaccine excipients from their starting material, extensive dilution of components of concern, the medicinal purpose of immunization (in contrast to diet), and lack of alternatives. Other important features included imperatives to preserve health and duty to community (e.g., parent to child, among neighbors). Concern that 'the body is a temple not to be defiled' is contrasted with other teaching and quality-control requirements in manufacturing vaccines and immune globulins. Health professionals who counsel hesitant patients or parents can ask about the basis for concern and how the individual applies religious understanding to decision-making about medical products, explain facts about content and processes, and suggest further dialog with informed religious leaders. Key considerations for observant believers for each populous religion are described.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis (TB) remains a deadly infectious disease affecting millions of people worldwide; 95\% of TB cases, with 98\% of death occur in developing countries. The situation in South Africa merits special attention. A total of 21,913 sputum specimens of suspected TB patients from three provinces of South Africa routinely submitted to the TB laboratory of Dr. George Mukhari (DGM) Hospital were assayed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) growth and antibiotic susceptibility. The genetic diversity of 338 resistant strains were also studied. DNA isolated from the strains were restricted with Pvu II, transferred on to a nylon membrane and hybridized with a PCR-amplified horseradish peroxidase 245 bp IS6110 probe. Of the 338 resistant strains, 2.09\% had less than 5 bands of IS6110, and 98\% had 5 or more bands. Unique restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns were observed in 84.3\% of the strains, showing their epidemiological independence, and 15.7\% were grouped into 22 clusters. Thirty-two strains (61.5\%) from the 52 that clustered were from Mpumalanga, 16/52 (30.8\%) from Gauteng, and 4/52 (9.6\%) from Limpopo province. Clustering was not associated with age. However, strains from male patients in Mpumalanga were more likely to be clustered than strains from male patients in Limpopo and/or Gauteng province. The minimum estimate for the proportion of resistant TB that was due to transmission is 9.06\% (52-22 = 30/331). Our results indicate that transmission of drug-resistant strains may contribute substantially to the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we introduce a simple mathematical analysis to reexamine vesicle dynamics in the quasispherical limit (small deformation) under a shear flow. In this context, a recent paper [Misbah, Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 028104 (2006)] revealed a dynamic referred to as the vacillating-breathing (VB) mode where the vesicle main axis oscillates about the flow direction and the shape undergoes a breathinglike motion, as well as the tank-treading and tumbling (TB) regimes. Our goal here is to identify these three modes by obtaining explicit analytical expressions of the vesicle inclination angle and the shape deformation. In particular, the VB regime is put in evidence and the transition dynamics is discussed. Not surprisingly, our finding confirms the Keller-Skalak solutions (for rigid particles) and shows that the VB and TB modes coexist, and whether one prevails over the other depends on the initial conditions. An interesting additional element in the discussion is the prediction of the TB and VB modes as functions of a control parameter Γ, which can be identified as a TB-VB parameter.},

  Abstract                 = {Airliner cabins have high occupant density and long exposure time, so the risk of airborne infection transmission could be high if one or more passengers are infected with an airborne infectious disease. The droplets exhaled by an infected passenger may contain infectious agents. This study developed a method to predict the amount of expiratory droplets inhaled by the passengers in an airliner cabin for any flight duration. The spatial and temporal distribution of expiratory droplets for the first 3 min after the exhalation from the index passenger was obtained using the computational fluid dynamics simulations. The perfectly mixed model was used for beyond 3 min after the exhalation. For multiple exhalations, the droplet concentration in a zone can be obtained by adding the droplet concentrations for all the exhalations until the current time with a time shift via the superposition method. These methods were used to determine the amount of droplets inhaled by the susceptible passengers over a 4-h flight under three common scenarios. The method, if coupled with information on the viability and the amount of infectious agent in the droplet, can aid in evaluating the infection risk.The distribution of the infectious agents contained in the expiratory droplets of an infected occupant in an indoor environment is transient and non-uniform. The risk of infection can thus vary with time and space. The investigations developed methods to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of expiratory droplets, and the inhalation of these droplets in an aircraft cabin. The methods can be used in other indoor environments to assess the relative risk of infection in different zones, and suitable measures to control the spread of infection can be adopted. Appropriate treatment can be implemented for the zone identified as high-risk zones.},

Indoor environments such as the airliner cabins may be susceptible to infection from such airborne contagious agents. The present investigation computed the transport of the droplets exhaled by the index patient seated in the middle of a seven-row, twin-aisle, fully occupied cabin using the CFD simulations. The droplets exhaled were from a single cough, a single breath, and a 15-s talk of the index patient. The expiratory droplets were tracked by using Lagrangian method, and their evaporation was modeled. It was found that the bulk airflow pattern in the cabin played the most important role on the droplet transport. The droplets were contained in the row before, at, and after the index patient within 30 s and dispersed uniformly to all the seven rows in 4 minutes. The total airborne droplet fraction reduced to 48, 32, 20, and 12\% after they entered the cabin for 1, 2, 3, and 4 min, respectively, because of the ventilation from the environmental control system.It is critical to predict the risk of airborne infection to take appropriate measures to control and mitigate the risk. Most of the studies in past either assume a homogenous distribution of contaminants or use steady-state conditions. The present study instead provides information on the transient movement of the droplets exhaled by an index passenger in an aircraft cabin. These droplets may contain active contagious agents and can be potent enough to cause infection. The findings can be used by medical professionals to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of risk of infection to various passengers in the cabin.},

The aim of this study was to investigate anti-tuberculosis potential of the plants using Mycobacterium smegmatis as a rapid screening model for detection of anti-mycobacterial activity and further to evaluate the active plants for anti-tuberculosis activity against M. tuberculosis using radiometric BACTEC assay.The 15 plants were screened for anti-mycobacterial activity against M. smegmatis by the disk diffusion assay. The ethanolic extracts of Mallotus philippensis, Vitex negundo, Colebrookea oppositifolia, Rumex hastatus, Mimosa pudica, Kalanchoe integra and Flacourtia ramontchii were active against M. smegmatis in primary screening. The anti-tuberculosis potential was identified in the leaves extracts of Mallotus philippensis by radiometric BACTEC assay. The ethanolic extract of M. philippensis showed anti-tuberculosis activity against virulent and avirulent strains of M. tuberculosis H(37) Rv and M. tuberculosis H(37) Ra with minimum inhibitory concentration 0·25 and 0·125 mg ml(-1), respectively. The inhibition in growth index values of M. tuberculosis was observed in the presence of ethyl acetate fraction at a minimum concentration of 0·05 mg ml(-1).We found that BACTEC radiometric assay is a valuable method for detection of anti-tuberculosis activity of the plant extracts. The results indicate that ethanolic extract and ethyl acetate fraction of M. philippensis exhibited significant anti-mycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis.These findings provide scientific evidence to support the traditional medicinal uses of M. philippensis and indicate a promising potential of this plant for the development of anti-tuberculosis agent.},

  Abstract                 = {Finding more effective vaccines against tuberculosis (TB) and improved preventive treatments against endogenous reactivation of latent TB is strategic to block transmission and reach the WHO goal of eliminating TB by 2050. Key related open questions in TB research include: i) what are the determinants of a strong memory response upon primary infection? ii) what is the role of cytokines towards protective memory response against a secondary infection? iii) what are the mechanisms responsible for the increased risk of reactivation in elderly individuals? To address these questions, we explored a computational model of the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis including a mathematical description of immunosenescence and the generation and maintenance of immune memory. Sensitivity analysis techniques, together with extensive model characterization and in silico experiments, were applied to identify key mechanisms controlling TB reactivation and immunological memory. Key findings of this study are summarized by the following model predictions: i) increased strength and duration of memory protection is associated with higher levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-[Formula: see text] (TNF) during primary infection; ii) production of TNF, but not of interferon-[Formula: see text], by memory T cells during secondary infection is a major determinant of effective protection; iii) impaired recruitment of CD4+ T cells may promote reactivation of latent TB infections in aging hosts. This study is a first attempt to consider the immune dynamics of a persistent infection throughout the lifetime of the host, taking into account immunosenescence and memory. While the model is TB specific, the results are applicable to other persistent bacterial infections and can aid in the development, evaluation and refinement of TB treatment and/or vaccine protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {This study longitudinally examines the relation between a history of experiencing childhood and adult physical or sexual abuse, and male condom use by women with or at risk for HIV. Abuse history and prospective condom use data were collected from 214 HIV infected and 189 uninfected women participating in the HIV Epidemiology Research Study (HERS) who were inconsistent condom users at baseline and received two safer sex counseling sessions. Analyses were conducted to assess the association between abuse history and condom use while controlling for sociodemographic variables and other risk factors. HIV-uninfected women with a history of adult physical abuse were five times less likely to report consistent condom use at 1-year follow-up than uninfected women without a history of abuse while holding control variables constant. Expectations of a negative reaction by the partner to suggested condom use did not explain this association. Though in the same direction as in uninfected women, abuse history was not significantly related to consistent condom use among HIV-infected women. These data indicate the need to develop risk prevention strategies tailored to uninfected women with a history of adult abuse. In lieu of specialized interventions, health care providers should assess women's abuse history and supplement HIV prevention counseling with mental health counseling when indicated.},

The global TB emergency has been further exacerbated by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB strains that are resistant to our best antibiotics and very difficult to treat. This review also focuses on the emergence of XDR-TB strains, the global health impact, and existing treatment options and outcomes for XDR-TB disease. Finally, this review briefly describes new anti-tuberculosis drugs currently in Phase II clinical evaluations and the impetus for discovering new antibacterial compounds to target drug-resistant M. tuberculosis and improve tuberculosis therapy.},

Serum progesterone averaged 44.7 nmol X l-1 in L and 0.7 nmol X l-1 in F. After a 4-h resting period, exercise was performed between 3 and 4 A.M., when the L-F core temperature difference is maximal. Preexercise esophageal (Tes), tympanic (Tty), and rectal (Tre) temperatures averaged 0.6 degrees C higher in L. During exercise Tes, Tty, and Tre averaged 0.5 degrees C higher. The thresholds for chest sweating and cutaneous vasodilation (heat clearance technique) at the thumb and forearm were elevated in L by an average of 0.47 degrees C, related to mean body temperature (Tb(es) = 0.87Tes + 0.13Tskin), Tes, Tty, or Tre. The above-threshold chest sweat rate and cutaneous heat clearances were also increased in L. The mean exercise heart rate was 170.0 beats X min-1 in L and 163.8 beats X min-1 in F. The mean exercise VO2 in L (2.21 l X min-1) was 5.2\% higher than in F (2.10 l X min-1), the metabolic rate was increased in L by 5.6\%, but the net efficiency was 5.3\% lower. No significant L-F differences in the respiratory exchange ratio and postexercise plasma lactate were demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

We compared the effects of antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) to that of existing family planning (FP) use and estimated the burden of pediatric HIV disease due to unwanted fertility.Using the demographic software Spectrum, a baseline mathematical projection to estimate the current pediatric HIV burden in Uganda was compared to three hypothetical projections: 1) without ARV-PMTCT (to estimate the effect of ARV-PMTCT), 2) without contraception (effect of existing FP use), 3) without unwanted fertility (effect of unmet FP needs). Key input parameters included HIV prevalence, ARV-PMTCT uptake, MTCT probabilities, and TFR. We estimate that in 2007, an estimated 25,000 vertical infections and 17,000 pediatric AIDS deaths occurred (baseline projection). Existing ARV-PMTCT likely averted 8.1\% of infections and 8.5\% of deaths. FP use likely averted 19.7\% of infections and 13.1\% of deaths. Unwanted fertility accounted for 21.3\% of infections and 13.4\% of deaths. During 2008-2012, an estimated 131,000 vertical infections and 71,000 pediatric AIDS deaths will occur. The projected scale up of ARV-PMTCT (from 39\%-57\%) may avert 18.1\% of infections and 24.5\% of deaths. Projected FP use may avert 21.6\% of infections and 18.5\% of deaths. Unwanted fertility will account for 24.5\% of infections and 19.8\% of deaths.Existing FP use contributes as much or more than ARV-PMTCT in mitigating pediatric HIV in Uganda. Expanding FP services can substantially contribute towards PMTCT.},

  Abstract                 = {Nosocomial clustering with transmission to health care workers, patients and visitors is a prominent feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Hospital outbreaks of SARS typically occurred within the first week after admission of the very first SARS cases when the disease was not recognized and before isolation measures were implemented. In the majority of nosocomial infections, there was a history of close contact with a SARS patient, and transmission occurred via large droplets, direct contact with infectious material or by contact with fomites contaminated by infectious material. In a few instances, potential airborne transmission was reported in association with endotracheal intubation, nebulised medications and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation of SARS patients. In all SARS-affected countries, nosocomial transmission of the disease was effectively halted by enforcement of routine standard, contact and droplet precautions in all clinical areas and additional airborne precautions in the high-risk areas. In Hong Kong, where there are few private rooms for patient isolation, some hospitals have obtained good outcome by having designated SARS teams and separate wards for patient triage, confirmed SARS cases and step-down of patients in whom SARS had been ruled out. In conclusion, SARS represents one of the new challenges for those who are involved in hospital infection control. As SARS might re-emerge, all hospitals should take advantage of the current SARS-free interval to review their infection control programmes, alert mechanisms, response capability and to repair any identified inadequacies.},

The association between TB and transport occupation and MDR-TB and transport occupation is high (respectively OR 3.06, 95\%CI 2.2-4.2 and OR 3.14, 95\%CI 1.1-9.1).These results indicate that the use of informal public transport is a risk factor for TB infection and an occupational risk in countries with characteristics similar to those in Peru.},

  Abstract                 = {The visible fluorescence of terbium(III) when bound to a calcium binding site of thermolysin is greatly enhanced with an excitation maximum at 280 nm but substitution of cobalt(II) for zinc at the active site decreases the intensity by 89.5\%. Treatment with N-bromosuccinimide quenches enzyme tryptophan and Tb(III) fluorescence to a similar extent and suggests the operation of tryptophan vector Tb(III) vector Co(II) energy relay system in the enzyme. Dipoledipole radiationless energy transfer between the Tb(III) donor and the Co(II) acceptor can account for this quenching. The inherent characteristics of the metal pair limits the value of the orientation factor, K2, of the Förster equation, thereby reducing uncertainties in distance measurements by energy transfer compared with other systems. A quantum yield of 0.51 yields a value of R0, the distance for 50\% energy transfer, of 19.6 A, and a distance, R, between Tb(III) and Co(II) of 13.7 A, a value identical to that measured for the distance between the active site zinc atom and calcium atom number 1 by x-ray analysis in native thermolysin crystals. The limits of confidence of this measurement are discussed. Energy transfer between two different metal atom sites of a protein provides a new class of probes to measure intramolecular distances of biological macromolecules in solution.},

  Abstract                 = {Antiviral therapy and vaccination are important strategies for controlling pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) but efficacy depends on the timing of administration and is often limited by supply shortage. Patients with dyspnea, tachypnea, evidence of hypoxemia, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph should be hospitalized. Patients with severe illness or underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of more severe disease should be treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir as soon as possible, without waiting for the results of laboratory tests. Lung-protective ventilation strategy with a low tidal volume and adequate pressure, in addition to a conservative fluid management approach, is recommended when treating adult patients with ARDS. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has emerged as an important rescue therapy for critically ill patients. Use of systemic steroids was associated with delayed viral clearance in severe acute respiratory syndrome and H3N2 infection. Low-dose corticosteroids may be considered in the treatment of refractory septic shock. Passive immunotherapy in the form of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin may be explored as rescue therapy. More data are needed to explore the potential role of IV gamma globulin and other drugs with immunomodulating properties, such as statins, gemfibrozil, and N-acetyl-cysteine. Health-care workers must apply strict standard and droplet precautions when dealing with suspected and confirmed case and upgrade to airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Nonpharmacologic measures, such as early case isolation, household quarantine, school/workplace closure, good community hygiene, and restrictions on travel are useful measures in controlling an influenza pandemic at its early phase.},

  Abstract                 = {The spread of infectious disease via commercial airliner travel is a significant and realistic threat. To shed some light on the feasibility of detecting airborne pathogens, a sensor integration study has been conducted and computational investigations of contaminant transport in an aircraft cabin have been performed. Our study took into consideration sensor sensitivity as well as the time-to-answer, size, weight and the power of best available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. We conducted computational fluid dynamics simulations to investigate three types of scenarios: (1) nominal breathing (up to 20 breaths per minute) and coughing (20 times per hour); (2) nominal breathing and sneezing (4 times per hour); and (3) nominal breathing only. Each scenario was implemented with one or seven infectious passengers expelling air and sneezes or coughs at the stated frequencies. Scenario 2 was implemented with two additional cases in which one infectious passenger expelled 20 and 50 sneezes per hour, respectively. All computations were based on 90 minutes of sampling using specifications from a COTS aerosol collector and biosensor. Only biosensors that could provide an answer in under 20 minutes without any manual preparation steps were included. The principal finding was that the steady-state bacteria concentrations in aircraft would be high enough to be detected in the case where seven infectious passengers are exhaling under scenarios 1 and 2 and where one infectious passenger is actively exhaling in scenario 2. Breathing alone failed to generate sufficient bacterial particles for detection, and none of the scenarios generated sufficient viral particles for detection to be feasible. These results suggest that more sensitive sensors than the COTS devices currently available and/or sampling of individual passengers would be needed for the detection of bacteria and viruses in aircraft.},

  Abstract                 = {The incidence of tuberculosis in Japan is the highest among developed countries, with approximately 42,000 new cases reported in 1997, marking the first increase in 38 years. The growing incidence among the elderly and group infections among young adults may be responsible for this increase. Infection with tubercle bacilli(TB) occurs via airborne transmission, which involves dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei on evaporated droplets that may remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be dispersed widely by air currents, therefore, special air handling and ventilation are required to prevent airborne transmission. Patients with infectious TB must be placed in a single room with negative pressure and a ventilation rate of 6 or more air changes per hour. Health care workers must wear an N95 mask when entering the room, and if an incident involving possible TB infection occurs in the hospital, the concerned people should be examined for Tuberculin reaction. Two to 12 weeks after the TB infection has occurred, the tuberculin reaction converts to positive. However, most Japanese people have been vaccinated with BCG, so assessment of the results is difficult. A comparison of the diameter of erythema before and after the potential infection may be the most confirmatory. If latent TB infection is suspected, preventive therapy with isoniazid must be considered. Special biohazard systems in the clinical laboratory and autopsy room have also been proposed to prevent TB dispersal. DOTS(Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course) is useful to prevent the emergence of multi-drug-resistant TB. In some areas of Japan that have low levels of compliance with TB therapy, trials of DOTS have been started.},

Hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin reduce the risk of the baby becoming a carrier, but with only a short window period after birth to deliver this potentially life-saving intervention. We reviewed the evidence on the magnitude of the risk. If the carrier mother is e antigen positive (highly infective), the calculated risk to the infant without intervention is 75.2\%, reduced to 6.0\% by giving vaccine and immunoglobulin at birth. If the mother is surface antigen positive but e antigen negative, the risk to the infant without intervention is 10.3\%, reduced to 1.0\% by giving vaccine and immunoglobulin. If vaccine is accepted but immunoglobulin refused, as for example by some Jehovah's Witnesses, the risk to babies of e antigen positive mothers is reduced to 21.0\% and to babies of e antigen negative mothers to 2.6\%. These figures can be used to inform parents and as a possible basis for child protection proceedings if parents decline vaccine and/or immunoglobulin. We argue from the perspective of the best interests of the child that the severity of the condition justifies initiating child protection proceedings whenever a baby is born to a hepatitis B carrier mother and, despite concerted attempts to persuade them, the parents refuse vaccine and/or immunoglobulin.},

Arguments used to justify making immunizations compulsory include enhancing the health of the community and treating as paramount the rights of the child to be protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. But compulsory immunization infringes the autonomy of parents to make choices about child rearing, an autonomy which we generally respect unless doing so seriously endangers the child's health. We present a historical review and ethics discussion on whether routine childhood immunizations should be compulsory. We conclude that, for both ethical and practical reasons, routine immunization should not be compulsory if adequate levels of immunization can be achieved by other means.},

The first is the issue of compulsory immunisation: what should be done about parents who fail to immunise their children? The second is: given competing demands on health care budgets, how should principles of justice in access and distribution inform vaccination programmes? This paper considers these two issues in the light of traditional ethical principles. With respect to the first, we argue that compulsion is justified only in cases in which we know with practical certainty that parental failure to immunise puts their own child or other children at high risk of severe illness. We also argue that the state should compensate those who suffer vaccine-related injury. With respect to the second, we claim that allocating resources according to health care need requires establishing priorities between public health programmes such as immunisation and other treatment programmes.},

Initially, QuickBird 0.61 m data, encompassing visible bands and the near infra-red bands, were selected to synthesize images of land cover attributes of the study site. Data of residential addresses of individual patients with smear-positive MDR-TB were geocoded, prevalence rates calculated and then digitally overlaid onto the satellite data within a 2 km buffer of 31 georeferenced health centers, using a 10 m2 grid-based algorithm. Geographical information system (GIS)-gridded measurements of each health center were generated based on preliminary base maps of the georeferenced data aggregated to block groups and census tracts within each buffered area. A three-dimensional model of the study site was constructed based on a digital elevation model (DEM) to determine terrain covariates associated with the sampled MDR-TB covariates. Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the linear relationship between the DEM and the sampled MDR-TB data. A SAS/GIS(R) module was then used to calculate univariate statistics and to perform linear and non-linear regression analyses using the sampled predictor variables. The estimates generated from a global autocorrelation analyses were then spatially decomposed into empirical orthogonal bases using a negative binomial regression with a non-homogeneous mean. Results of the DEM analyses indicated a statistically non-significant, linear relationship between georeferenced health centers and the sampled covariate elevation. The data exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation and the decomposition of Moran's coefficient into uncorrelated, orthogonal map pattern components revealed global spatial heterogeneities necessary to capture latent autocorrelation in the MDR-TB model. It was thus shown that Poisson regression analyses and spatial eigenvector mapping can elucidate the mechanics of MDR-TB transmission by prioritizing clinical and environmental-sampled predictor variables for identifying high risk populations.},

  Abstract                 = {The phenomenon of drug resistance in tubercle bacilli (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) has been recognized since the early years of chemotherapy of tuberculosis (TB). However it was not until the mid-1990s, that the magnitude of the problem was highlighted by the first global report of the World Health Organization on the prevalence of anti-TB drug resistance. Up to now, four such reports have been released. Not only have they shown that drug resistance is present worldwide, but they have also demonstrated its expansiveness and a high tendency for progression. The two most detrimental forms of drug-resistant TB are multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. Whereas MDR-TB implies resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the most potent drugs in the first-line regimen, XDR-TB is defined as MDR-TB with resistance to any of the fluoroquinolones and any of the second-line injectable drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). The emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB are among the key factors contributing to the persistence of TB within the human population. This article outlines the current epidemiological status of drug-resistant TB in the world, Europe, and Poland.},

Recent studies have described XDR-TB strains from all continents. Worldwide prevalence of XDR-TB is estimated to be c. 6.6\% in all the studied countries among multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. The emergence of XDR-TB strains is a reflection of poor tuberculosis management, and controlling its emergence constitutes an urgent global health reality and a challenge to tuberculosis control activities in all parts of the world, especially in developing countries and those lacking resources and as well as in countries with increasing prevalence of HIV/AIDS.},

The definition has applicable clinical value and has allowed for more uniform surveillance in varied international settings. Recent surveillance data have indicated that the prevalence of tuberculosis drug resistance has risen to the highest rate ever recorded. The gold standard for drug-susceptibility testing has been the agar proportion method; however, this technique requires several weeks for results to be determined. More sensitive and specific diagnostic tests are still unavailable in resource-limited settings. Clinical manifestations, although variable in different settings and among different strains, have in general shown that XDR tuberculosis is associated with greater morbidity and mortality than non-XDR tuberculosis. The treatment of XDR tuberculosis should include agents to which the organism is susceptible, and should continue for a minimum of 18-24 months. However, treatment continues to be limited in tuberculosis-endemic countries largely because of weaknesses in national tuberculosis health-care models. The ultimate strategy to control drug-resistant tuberculosis is one that implements a comprehensive approach incorporating innovation from the political, social, economic, and scientific realms.},

  Abstract                 = {The largest recorded outbreak of a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), detected in Nigeria, provides a unique opportunity to analyze the pathogenicity of the virus, the clinical severity of the disease, and the effectiveness of control measures for cVDPVs as compared with wild-type poliovirus (WPV).We identified cases of acute flaccid paralysis associated with fecal excretion of type 2 cVDPV, type 1 WPV, or type 3 WPV reported in Nigeria through routine surveillance from January 1, 2005, through June 30, 2009. The clinical characteristics of these cases, the clinical attack rates for each virus, and the effectiveness of oral polio vaccines in preventing paralysis from each virus were compared.No significant differences were found in the clinical severity of paralysis among the 278 cases of type 2 cVDPV, the 2323 cases of type 1 WPV, and the 1059 cases of type 3 WPV. The estimated average annual clinical attack rates of type 1 WPV, type 2 cVDPV, and type 3 WPV per 100,000 susceptible children under 5 years of age were 6.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 5.9 to 7.7), 2.7 (95\% CI, 1.9 to 3.6), and 4.0 (95\% CI, 3.4 to 4.7), respectively. The estimated effectiveness of trivalent oral polio vaccine against paralysis from type 2 cVDPV was 38\% (95\% CI, 15 to 54\%) per dose, which was substantially higher than that against paralysis from type 1 WPV (13\%; 95\% CI, 8 to 18\%), or type 3 WPV (20\%; 95\% CI, 12 to 26\%). The more frequent use of serotype 1 and serotype 3 monovalent oral polio vaccines has resulted in improvements in vaccine-induced population immunity against these serotypes and in declines in immunity to type 2 cVDPV.The attack rate and severity of disease associated with the recent cVDPV identified in Nigeria are similar to those associated with WPV. International planning for the management of the risk of WPV, both before and after eradication, must include scenarios in which equally virulent and pathogenic cVDPVs could emerge.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this study was to propose a model for the ultrasonic frequency-dependent backscatter coefficient in cancellous bone. This model allows us to address the inverse problem and to predict the mean trabecular thickness. A weak scattering model is used and the backscatter coefficient is expressed in terms of an autocorrelation function of the medium. Different autocorrelation functions (Gaussian, exponential and densely populated media) were used to compute the backscatter coefficient and comparison is made with experimental data for 19 specimens and for frequency ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 MHz. For each specimen, a nonlinear regression was performed and the mean trabecular thickness is estimated. Experimental data and theoretical predictions were averaged over the 19 specimens. A good agreement between experimental data and predictions was found for both the magnitude and the frequency-dependence of the backscatter coefficient. We also found a good agreement between the experimental mean trabecular thickness (Tb. Th = 130 +/- 6.5 micro m) derived from the analysis of bone 3-D microarchitecture using high-resolution microtomography and theoretical predictions (d(Gauss) = 140 +/- 10 micro m, d(exponential) = 153 +/- 12.5 micro m and d(dense) = 138 +/- 6.5 micro m). These results open interesting prospects for the estimation of the mean trabecular thickness from in vivo measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health threat in South Korea.We analyzed baseline epidemiological data for 250 patients enrolled in an ongoing prospective observational study of TB at a large tertiary referral hospital in South Korea.Twenty-six subjects with XDR TB were identified; all were patients who had previously received TB therapy. Cumulative previous treatment duration (range, 18-34 months; odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-59), number of previously received second-line anti-TB drugs (OR, 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.5), and female sex (OR, 3.2; 95\% CI, 1.1-8.3) were significantly associated with XDR TB in crude analyses. After controlling for other factors in a multivariable model, cumulative previous treatment duration remained significantly associated with XDR TB (OR, 5.8; 95\% CI, 1.0-61). Subjects with XDR TB were more likely to produce culture-positive sputum at 6 months, compared with patients with non-multidrug resistant TB (risk ratio, 13; 95\% CI, 5.1-53). Kanamycin resistance was found to be predictive of 6-month culture positivity after adjustment for ofloxacin and streptomycin resistance (risk ratio, 3.9; 95\% CI, 1.9-11).XDR TB was found to be associated with the cumulative duration of previous treatment with second-line TB drugs among subjects in a tertiary care TB hospital. Patients with XDR TB were more likely to not respond to therapy, and successful conversion of sputum culture results to negative was correlated with initial susceptibility to both fluoroquinolones and kanamycin but not to streptomycin.},

In these 26 counties we assessed which patient-related and treatment-related factors were associated with non-cure.We conducted a prospective cohort study. Smear positive pulmonary TB patients treated at the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were interviewed before start of treatment and during the fifth month of treatment using structured questionnaires. Information on treatment outcome was extracted from patient records. Patients cured at the end of treatment were compared to patients with unsuccessful treatment outcomes (failure, default, and death).A total of 841 patients were registered between January-June 2007 of which 792 (94\%) were cured. Independent risk factors for non-cure were having a low income (<3000 RMB per year), not having medical insurance, a delay in health care seeking >30 days, a positive smear test result two months after start of treatment, not being aware of the need to go to the CDC for medical follow up during treatment, and not seeing the need for treatment observation.Reducing the financial burden of TB disease and providing health education to improve compliance with treatment could increase the proportion of patients with successful treatment outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Websites opposing vaccination are prevalent on the Internet. Web 2.0, defined by interaction and user-generated content, has become ubiquitous. Furthermore, a new postmodern paradigm of healthcare has emerged, where power has shifted from doctors to patients, the legitimacy of science is questioned, and expertise is redefined. Together this has created an environment where anti-vaccine activists are able to effectively spread their messages. Evidence shows that individuals turn to the Internet for vaccination advice, and suggests such sources can impact vaccination decisions - therefore it is likely that anti-vaccine websites can influence whether people vaccinate themselves or their children. This overview examines the types of rhetoric individuals may encounter online in order to better understand why the anti-vaccination movement can be convincing, despite lacking scientific support for their claims. Tactics and tropes commonly used to argue against vaccination are described. This includes actions such as skewing science, shifting hypotheses, censoring dissent, and attacking critics; also discussed are frequently made claims such as not being "anti-vaccine" but "pro-safe vaccines", that vaccines are toxic or unnatural, and more. Recognizing disingenuous claims made by the anti-vaccination movement is essential in order to critically evaluate the information and misinformation encountered online.},

This paper builds upon previous research by analyzing the arguments proffered on anti-vaccination websites, determining the extent of misinformation present, and examining discourses used to support vaccine objections. Arguments around the themes of safety and effectiveness, alternative medicine, civil liberties, conspiracy theories, and morality were found on the majority of websites analyzed; misinformation was also prevalent. The most commonly proposed method of combating this misinformation is through better education, although this has proven ineffective. Education does not consider the discourses supporting vaccine rejection, such as those involving alternative explanatory models of health, interpretations of parental responsibility, and distrust of expertise. Anti-vaccination protestors make postmodern arguments that reject biomedical and scientific "facts" in favour of their own interpretations. Pro-vaccination advocates who focus on correcting misinformation reduce the controversy to merely an "educational" problem; rather, these postmodern discourses must be acknowledged in order to begin a dialogue.},

  Abstract                 = {An observational study was carried out, using data collected from four areas in the Irish midlands, between 1989 and 2004, to critically evaluate the long-term effects of proactive badger culling and to provide insights into reactive badger culling tuberculosis (TB) prevalence in cattle. Confirmed cattle herd TB incidence is the outcome measure used throughout. Relative to reactive culling, proactive badger culling was associated with a decrease in incidence in each of the 16 years of observation, which encompassed periods of both intensive and less-intensive badger removal. By 2004, we observed a decrease of 22\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 15-29, P<0.001] in the entire proactive and 37\% (95\% CI 25-47, P<0.001), in the inner proactive removal areas. The size of the decrease increased with time (P=0.055). There was a decrease (constant over time) of at least 14\% (95\% CI 76-97, P=0.013) in incidence in the inner compared to the outer control area (herds < or = 2 km, >2 km, from proactive removal area boundaries, respectively). Incidence in the outer proactive removal area (herds < 1.6 km from the proactive removal boundary) was similar to the inner control area (P=0.890). Incidence in the outer control area and total control area, compared to a neighbouring area some distance away, increased over the course of the study. Differences with the total control area were not statistically significant but the outer control area was 11\% higher than the neighbouring area by 2004 (borderline significance P=0.057).},

Control of livestock infections depends in part on the spatial and social structure of the wildlife host. Here we describe spatial association of M. bovis infection in a badger population using data from the first year of the Four Area Project in Ireland. Using second-order intensity functions, we show there is strong evidence of clustering of TB cases in each the four areas, i.e. a global tendency for infected cases to occur near other infected cases. Using estimated intensity functions, we identify locations where particular strains of TB cluster. Generalized linear geostatistical models are used to assess the practical range at which spatial correlation occurs and is found to exceed 6 in all areas. The study is of relevance concerning the scale of localized badger culling in the control of the disease in cattle.},

We review the history of surgical therapy for tuberculosis and reports of its role in treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis. 26 case series and cohort studies were included, and together showed that surgical resection is beneficial in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, the results might not be applicable in all settings because investigations were observational and typically included patients with less severe disease, and all surgeries were done at specialised thoracic-surgery centres. Well designed studies are needed to establish the efficacy of surgery in treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis.},

  Abstract                 = {In the United States, an increasingly disproportionate burden of tuberculosis among the foreign-born population has led to calls for improvements in the detection and treatment of latent infection in new immigrants. Current treatment guidelines do not take into account global differences in drug-resistance patterns or their implications for the treatment of immigrants. The use of multinational surveillance systems to guide the management of latent infection according to region-specific drug-resistance profiles could improve the efficiency of efforts to reduce the burden of tuberculosis in immigrants to the United States.We constructed a decision-analysis model by using a hypothetical cohort of all documented immigrants entering the United States from developing nations. Region-specific drug-resistance profiles were derived from data on 30,388 cases of infection. The model examined the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of four strategies: no intervention or tuberculin skin testing followed by treatment with isoniazid, treatment with rifampin, or treatment with rifampin plus pyrazinamide for those with a positive test result.A strategy of detecting and treating latent tuberculosis infection was cost-saving among immigrants from Mexico, Haiti, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and developing nations in East Asia and the Pacific. This strategy was highly cost effective among immigrants from other developing nations. Rifampin plus pyrazinamide was the preferred strategy for treating latent infection in immigrants from Vietnam, Haiti, and the Philippines.For new immigrants to the United States from developing nations, a strategy of detecting and treating latent tuberculosis infection would lead to substantial health and economic benefits. Because of the high prevalence of resistance to isoniazid, treatment with a rifampin-containing regimen should be strongly considered for immigrants from Vietnam, Haiti, and the Philippines.},

  Abstract                 = {Human plague has been an important public health problem in Tanzania for over a century. Recorded outbreaks of the disease have been reported from various parts of Tanzania, including Iringa, Kagera, Singida, Mbulu, Arusha and Kilimanjaro since 1886. Since 1980 however, only Lushoto, Singida and Karatu districts have experienced outbreaks of the disease. Of these areas, Lushoto has disproportionately high incidences of the disease and this has persisted for nearly 17 years. Efforts to curb the disease through conventional methods, including control of vectors and reservoirs, chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis, enforcement of sanitation improvement as well as health education, have been applied every year, but plague cases and deaths continue to occur in the area to date. During the period April 1980 to December 1996, a total of 6599 cases with 580 (8.8\%) deaths were recorded. Biological factors, such as the presence of suitable rodent reservoirs, efficient flea vectors and plague bacillus, could be partly responsible for the long persistence and reccurence of the disease. Since such factors are also common in other plague foci where the disease has never been persistently recurrent, and where indigenous people are culturally different from those in Lushoto, it is assumed that socio-cultural factors play an important role as determinants of the disease in the latter district. This paper reports preliminary observations on socio-cultural, biological and environmental factors which are thought to be, at least partly, responsible for the long persistence and repeated outbreaks of plague in the district. These include traditional beliefs on the cause and health seeking behaviour for treatment of plague, sleeping and food storage habits, large populations of rodents and fleas, and status of the immediate environment.},

  Abstract                 = {The rise of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) tuberculosis around the world, including in industrialized nations, poses a great threat to human health and defines a need to develop new, effective and inexpensive anti-tubercular agents. Previously we developed a chemical systems biology approach to identify off-targets of major pharmaceuticals on a proteome-wide scale. In this paper we further demonstrate the value of this approach through the discovery that existing commercially available drugs, prescribed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, have the potential to treat MDR and XDR tuberculosis. These drugs, entacapone and tolcapone, are predicted to bind to the enzyme InhA and directly inhibit substrate binding. The prediction is validated by in vitro and InhA kinetic assays using tablets of Comtan, whose active component is entacapone. The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC(99)) of entacapone for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tuberculosis) is approximately 260.0 microM, well below the toxicity concentration determined by an in vitro cytotoxicity model using a human neuroblastoma cell line. Moreover, kinetic assays indicate that Comtan inhibits InhA activity by 47.0\% at an entacapone concentration of approximately 80 microM. Thus the active component in Comtan represents a promising lead compound for developing a new class of anti-tubercular therapeutics with excellent safety profiles. More generally, the protocol described in this paper can be included in a drug discovery pipeline in an effort to discover novel drug leads with desired safety profiles, and therefore accelerate the development of new drugs.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant (XDR) TB are big problems in the world. We have developed novel TB therapeutic vaccines, HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 + IL-12 DNA vaccine (HSP65-vaccine), granulysin vaccine and killer specific secretory protein of 37kDa (Ksp37) vaccine.   Methods and Results: HSP65 vaccine showed strong therapeutic effect against both MDR-TB and XDR-TB in mice. Intradermal immunization of HSP65-vaccine showed stronger therapeutic effect against TB than intramuscular or subcutaneous immunization. Furthermore, the synergistic therapeutic effect was observed when the vaccine was administrated in combination with Isoniazid (INH), which is a first line drug for chemotherapy. The combination of types of vaccines (HSP65- and granulysin- vaccines) also showed synergistic therapeutic effect. In the monkey model, granulysin-vaccine prolonged the survival period after the infection of TB and long-term survival was observed in vaccine-treated group. We examined the potential of two kinds of novel DNA vaccines (Ksp37-vaccine and granulysin-vaccine). Both vaccines augmented in vivo differentiation of CTL against TB. We measured the amount of Ksp37 protein in human serum and revealed that the level of Ksp37 protein of patients with tuberculosis was lower than that of healthy volunteers. Therefore, we established Ksp37 transgenic mice as well as granulysin transgenic mice to elucidate the function of those proteins. Both transgenic mice were resistant to TB infection. Conclusion: These data indicate the potential of combinational therapy; the combination of two DNA vaccines or combination of DNA vaccine with antibiotic drug. Thus, it will provide a novel strategy for the treatment of MDR-TB.},

  Abstract                 = {The precision errors of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements are important for monitoring osteoporosis. This study investigated the effect of body mass index (BMI) on precision errors for lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (NOF), total hip (TH), and total body (TB) bone mineral density using the GE Lunar Prodigy. One hundred two women with BMIs ranging from 18.5 to 45.9 kg/m(2) were recruited. Participants had duplicate DXA scans of the LS, left hip, and TB with repositioning between scans. Participants were divided into 3 groups based on their BMI and the percentage coefficient of variation (\%CV) calculated for each group. The \%CVs for the normal (<25 kg/m(2)) (n=48), overweight (25-30 kg/m(2)) (n=26), and obese (>30 kg/m(2)) (n=28) BMI groups, respectively, were LS BMD: 0.99\%, 1.30\%, and 1.68\%; NOF BMD: 1.32\%, 1.37\%, and 2.00\%; TH BMD: 0.85\%, 0.88\%, and 1.06\%; TB BMD: 0.66\%, 0.73\%, and 0.91\%. Statistically significant differences in precision error between the normal and obese groups were found for LS (p=0.0006), NOF (p=0.005), and TB BMD (p=0.025). These results suggest that serial measurements in obese subjects should be treated with caution because the least significant change may be larger than anticipated.},

During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic a case of probable transmission during car travel was reported in Australia, to which spread via the airborne route may have contributed. However, there are no data to indicate the likely risks of such events, and how they may vary and be mitigated. To address this knowledge gap, we estimated the risk of airborne influenza transmission in two cars (1989 model and 2005 model) by employing ventilation measurements and a variation of the Wells-Riley model. Results suggested that infection risk can be reduced by not recirculating air; however, estimated risk ranged from 59\% to 99·9\% for a 90-min trip when air was recirculated in the newer vehicle. These results have implications for interrupting in-car transmission of other illnesses spread by the airborne route.},

Four hundred and twenty rural clusters and 180 urban clusters were selected from these districts on the basis of the rural-urban ratio in the entire zone. To obtain the required sample of 12,000 children without bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, 51,000 had to be covered. Eighty-five children from each cluster were tuberculin tested and read for reaction sizes. The ARTI was computed from the estimated prevalence of TB infection among children without a BCG scar.Among 52,951 children registered for the study, 50,846 (96\%) had a tuberculin test result. The BCG coverage for the study population was about 65\%. Among 17,811 children without a BCG scar, the prevalence of infection was 5.9\% (95\%CI 4.0-7.7\%); the corresponding ARTI was 1.0\% (95\%CI 0.7-1.4\%) [correction].The estimated ARTI for the south zone is 1.0\%, as compared to the national average of 1.7\% used for programme evaluation. This baseline information should be useful for the assessment of future trends.},

For example, a Ugandan study comparing home-based and facility-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery found that both delivered equivalent clinical outcomes, but home-based delivery resulted in substantial cost savings to patients; and a retrospective cohort analysis of an HIV care programme in Lesotho demonstrated that devolving routine patient management to nurses and trained counsellors resulted in impressive gains in annual enrolment, retention in care and other clinical indicators.Studies also demonstrated how the use of trained counsellors and public health advisors could effectively expand both clinical and public health capacity in low-income settings. Studies evaluating the impact of integrating HIV and TB care resulted in improved treatment outcomes in coinfected populations, the development of environmental interventions to reduce TB transmission, and uncovering of the extent of multi-drug-resistant and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB and XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.Some mathematical modelling and cost-effectiveness studies presented at this meeting addressed interventions to increase retention in care, and strengthened the evidentiary basis for universal voluntary testing and immediate ART on reducing HIV transmission; debate continued about the relative merits of clinical versus laboratory monitoring. Finally, a provocative plenary presentation outlined the shortfalls of current prevention interventions and argued for more cost-effectiveness analyses to guide the selection of interventions for maximum benefit.},

Methods used to vaccinate infants and children included clinic visits to subcenters or to a health center, vaccination of siblings of students at primary schools, visits in a designated place in the community, and home visits by a health center team with the participation of local leaders and benevolent organizations, with the participation of medical and paramedical students, by a health center team with no community participation, or by primary school students who persuaded mothers to take their children to the mobile vaccination unit. A review of the vaccination records shows that, in the case of first vaccinations for DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) and polio conducted by door-to-door visits, follow-up vaccinations had been better and the costs lower when primary school students made home visits encouraging mothers to take their children to a mobile vaccination unit and with participation of local benevolent organizations. Overall, third dose coverage for these two vaccinations was higher with community participation (regardless of type of community participation) than without it (78\% vs. 67\%). Without doubt, community participation has a favorable effect on vaccination coverage.},

Using the mathematical concept of fuzzy distance transformation (FDT), we evaluated the accuracy of measurements of trabecular distance (Tb.Di(f)) which can be determined for vertebrae in vivo using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT).In a first step extrema voxels with a very high likelihood of representing bone or marrow are identified. A probability level of being a bone voxel is assigned to all other voxel. This probability is based on the FDT of the voxel's gray-level, preprint submitted to Elsevier June 10, 2008; revised July 15, 2008 i.e. the shortest gray-value weighted distance to the marrow background. Next, the resulting bone structure is skeletonized. The space between the ridges of the skeleton is filled with the largest possible spheres. The average over the radii of the spheres defines Tb.Di(f), a measure of trabecular distance. 14 whole vertebrae embedded in polymethyl methylacrylate were scanned by HRCT (voxel size 156 x 156 x 400 mum(3)) inside an anthropomorphic abdomen phantom. Scans obtained on Scanco Xtreme CT (XCT, voxel size 82(3) microm(3)) without the phantom were used as reference.Tb.Di(f) calculated on XCT data were almost identical to trabecular distance values (1/Tb.N*) determined with the manufacturer's standard software (r(2)=0.98). Tb.Di(f) values obtained with HRCT correlated strongly with Tb.Di(f) values obtained by XCT (r(2)=0.89). Over the range from 400 to 1400 microm trabecular distance could be estimated with a residual error of 78 microm.The FDT based variable Tb.Di(f) provides 3D estimates of trabecular distances with residual errors of less than 100 microm using a HRCT protocol which also can be employed in vivo for assessing vertebral microarchitecture.},

  Abstract                 = {In major immigrant-receiving countries, annual foreign-born tuberculosis (TB) case counts and rates are relatively constant. Why this is so, and who might be a high-yield target for screening for latent TB infection, remain open questions. Foreign-born TB in Canada during 1986-2002 was retrospectively examined using national TB and immigration data as well as census data. Case counts and rates were analysed in relation to demographics, immigration period and time since arrival. Pre-1986 immigrants (n=3,860,853) and 1986-2002 immigrants (n=3,463,283) contributed 8,662 and 9,613 TB cases, respectively. Immigrants arriving ≤ 5 yrs ago and those arriving >10 yrs ago contributed almost equally to the annual foreign-born TB case count despite a 3.5-fold difference in in-country person-yrs. Remarkably stable and relatively low TB incidence was observed among immigrants >10 yrs post-arrival. Conversely, TB incidence within 5 yrs of arrival was dynamic, demonstrating a strong inverse association with time since arrival and higher sensitivity to changes in immigration level than shifts toward higher incidence source countries. Relative constancy in foreign-born TB incidence is explained by a complex convergence of several factors. Immigrants born in high-incidence countries who arrived ≤ 2 yrs ago and were aged 15-34 yrs upon arrival constitute high-yield targets for preventive therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a significant health problem in Panama. The extent to which such cases are the result of primary or acquired resistance and the strain families involved are unknown. We performed whole-genome sequencing of a collection of 66 clinical MDR isolates, along with 31 drug-susceptible isolates, that were isolated in Panama between 2001 and 2010; 78\% of the MDR isolates belong to the Latin American-Mediterranean (LAM) family. Drug resistance mutations correlated well with drug susceptibility profiles. To determine the relationships among these strains and to better understand the acquisition of resistance mutations, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on a genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis. The phylogenetic tree shows that the isolates are highly clustered, with a single strain (LAM9-c1) accounting for nearly one-half of the MDR isolates (29/66 isolates). The LAM9-c1 strain was most prevalent among male patients of working age and was associated with high mortality rates. Members of this cluster all share identical mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid (KatG S315T mutation), rifampin (RpoB S531L mutation), and streptomycin (rrs C517T mutation). This evidence of primary resistance supports a model in which MDR-TB in Panama is driven by clonal expansion and ongoing transmission of several strains in the LAM family, including the highly successful MDR strain LAM9-c1. The phylogenetic analysis also shows that the LAM9-c1 strain is closely related to the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) extensively drug-resistant TB strain identified in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The LAM9-c1 and KZN strains likely arose from a recent common ancestor that was transmitted between Panama and South Africa and had the capacity to tolerate an accumulation of multiple resistance mutations.},

We evaluated 3,707 VFR and 17,507 non-VFR travelers seen for pre-travel consultation in Global TravEpiNet during 2009-2011; all were traveling to resource-poor destinations. VFR travelers more commonly visited urban destinations than non-VFR travelers (42\% versus 30\%, P < 0.0001); 54\% of VFR travelers were female, and 18\% of VFR travelers were under 6 years old. VFR travelers sought health advice closer to their departure than non-VFR travelers (median days before departure was 17 versus 26, P < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, being a VFR traveler was an independent predictor of declining a recommended vaccine. Missed opportunities for vaccination could be addressed by improving the timing of pre-travel health care and increasing the acceptance of vaccines. Making pre-travel health care available in primary care settings may be one step to this goal.},

The drug susceptibility testing procedures included the proportion, absolute concentration and resistance ratio methods as well as their variants, including the radiometric BACTEC 460 method.The first round of proficiency testing has shown that the specificity of drug susceptibility testing within the SRL network was significantly higher than its sensitivity. The testing of isoniazid and rifampicin shows a high degree of agreement between the labs, but discordant results can be obtained with streptomycin and ethambutol.Drug susceptibility procedures for the testing of isoniazid and rifampicin, the two anti tuberculosis drugs which define multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, are highly reliable within the SRL network.

  Abstract                 = {To evaluate the validity of the fixed mathematical relationship between the annual risk of tuberculous infection (ARTI), the prevalence of smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) and the incidence of smear-positive TB specified as the Styblo rule, which TB control programmes use to estimate the incidence of TB disease at a population level and the case detection rate.Population-based tuberculin surveys and surveys on prevalence of smear-positive TB since 1975 were identified through a literature search. For these surveys, the ratio between the number of tuberculous infections (based on ARTI estimates) and the number of smear-positive TB cases was calculated and compared to the ratio of 8 to 12 tuberculous infections per prevalent smear- positive TB case as part of the Styblo rule.Three countries had national population-based data on both ARTI and prevalence of smear-positive TB for more than one point in time. In China the ratio ranged from 3.4 to 5.8, in the Philippines from 2.6 to 4.4, and in the Republic of Korea, from 3.2 to 4.7. All ratios were markedly lower than the ratio that is part of the Styblo rule.According to recent country data, there are typically fewer than 8 to 12 tuberculous infections per prevalent smear-positive TB case, and it remains unclear whether this ratio varies significantly among countries. The decrease in the ratio compared to the Styblo rule probably relates to improvements in the prompt treatment of TB disease (by national TB programmes). A change in the number of tuberculous infections per prevalent smear-positive TB case in population-based surveys makes the assumed fixed mathematical relationship between ARTI and incidence of smear-positive TB no longer valid.},

  Abstract                 = {Measles remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children in developing countries. Due to the success of the measles mortality reduction and elimination efforts thus far, the WHO has raised the question of whether global eradication of measles is economically feasible.The cost-effectiveness of various measles mortality reduction and eradication scenarios was evaluated vis-à-vis the current mortality reduction goal in six countries and globally. Data collection on costs of measles vaccination were conducted in six countries in four regions: Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, Tajikistan, and Uganda. The number of measles cases and deaths were projected from 2010 to 2050 using a dynamic, age-structured compartmental model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were then calculated for each scenario vis a vis the baseline.Measles eradication by 2020 was the found to be the most cost-effective scenario, both in the six countries and globally. Eradicating measles by 2020 is projected to cost an additional discounted $7.8 billion and avert a discounted 346 million DALYs between 2010 and 2050.In conclusion, the study found that, compared to the baseline, reaching measles eradication by 2020 would be the most cost-effective measles mortality reduction scenario, both for the six countries and on a global basis.},

  Abstract                 = {The dormancy (DosR) regulon of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is expressed in vitro during hypoxia and low-dose nitric oxide stimulation. Tubercle bacilli are thought to encounter these conditions in humans during latent infection. In this study, immune responses were evaluated to 25 most strongly induced DosR-regulon-encoded proteins, referred to as latency antigens. Proliferation assays were performed using M. tuberculosis-specific T-cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from tuberculosis (TB) patients, tuberculin skin test positive (TST+) individuals and uninfected controls. All 25 latency antigens were able to induce production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by T-cell lines. Eighteen latency antigens were also recognized by PBMC of M. tuberculosis-infected individuals, which indicates expression of the DosR-regulon during natural infection. Differential analysis showed that TST+ individuals recognized more latency antigens and with a stronger cumulative IFN-gamma response than TB patients, while the opposite profile was found for culture filtrate protein-10. In particular Rv1733c, Rv2029c, Rv2627c and Rv2628 induced strong IFN-gamma responses in TST+ individuals, with 61\%, 61\%, 52\% and 35\% responders, respectively. In conclusion, several new M. tuberculosis antigens were identified within the DosR-regulon. Particularly strong IFN-gamma responses to latency antigens were observed in latently infected individuals, suggesting that immune responses against these antigens may contribute to controlling latent M. tuberculosis infection.},

  Abstract                 = {mRNA is a marker of cell viability. Quantifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis mRNA in sputum is a promising tool for monitoring response to antituberculosis therapy and evaluating the efficacy of individual drugs. mRNA levels were measured in sputum specimens from patients with tuberculosis (TB) receiving monotherapy in an early bactericidal activity study of fluoroquinolones and in those receiving a standard rifampin-based regimen in an interleukin-2 (IL-2) trial. In the early bactericidal activity study, sputum for quantitative culture and mRNA analysis was collected for 2 days before and daily during 7 days of study drug administration. In the IL-2 trial, sputum was collected for quantitative culture, Bactec 460 liquid culture, and mRNA analysis throughout the intensive treatment phase. RNA was isolated from digested sputum and tested in quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays for several gene targets. mRNA for the glyoxylate cycle enzyme isocitrate lyase declined at similar rates in patients receiving isoniazid, gatifloxicin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin monotherapy. Isocitrate lyase mRNA correlated highly with CFU in sputum prior to therapy and during 7 days of monotherapy in all treatment arms. Isocitrate lyase mRNA was detectable in sputum of culture-positive TB patients receiving a rifampin-based regimen for 1 month. At 2 months, sputum for isocitrate mRNA correlated more closely with growth in liquid culture than did growth on solid culture medium. Data suggest that isocitrate lyase mRNA is a reliable marker of M. tuberculosis viability.},

  Abstract                 = {There have been few recent studies demonstrating a definitive association between the transmission of airborne infections and the ventilation of buildings. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and current concerns about the risk of an avian influenza (H5N1) pandemic, have made a review of this area timely. We searched the major literature databases between 1960 and 2005, and then screened titles and abstracts, and finally selected 40 original studies based on a set of criteria. We established a review panel comprising medical and engineering experts in the fields of microbiology, medicine, epidemiology, indoor air quality, building ventilation, etc. Most panel members had experience with research into the 2003 SARS epidemic. The panel systematically assessed 40 original studies through both individual assessment and a 2-day face-to-face consensus meeting. Ten of 40 studies reviewed were considered to be conclusive with regard to the association between building ventilation and the transmission of airborne infection. There is strong and sufficient evidence to demonstrate the association between ventilation, air movements in buildings and the transmission/spread of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox and SARS. There is insufficient data to specify and quantify the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals, schools, offices, homes and isolation rooms in relation to spread of infectious diseases via the airborne route. PRACTICAL IMPLICATION: The strong and sufficient evidence of the association between ventilation, the control of airflow direction in buildings, and the transmission and spread of infectious diseases supports the use of negatively pressurized isolation rooms for patients with these diseases in hospitals, in addition to the use of other engineering control methods. However, the lack of sufficient data on the specification and quantification of the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals, schools and offices in relation to the spread of airborne infectious diseases, suggest the existence of a knowledge gap. Our study reveals a strong need for a multidisciplinary study in investigating disease outbreaks, and the impact of indoor air environments on the spread of airborne infectious diseases.},

Socio-demographic and clinical data were retrieved from medical records and analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with poor treatment outcomes and Cox proportional hazards regression model was further used to determine risk factors associated with death in TB patients. Among the 3,551 non-repetitive hospitalized TB patients who had drug susceptibility testing (DST) results, 716 (20.2\%) had MDR-TB and 51 (1.4\%) had XDR-TB. A total of 3,270 patients who had medical records available were used for further analyses. Treatment success rates (cured and treatment completed) were 90.9\%, 53.4\% and 29.2\% for patients with non-MDR-TB, patients with MDR-TB excluding XDR-TB and patients with XDR-TB, respectively. Independent risk factors associated with poor treatment outcomes in MDR-TB patients included being a migrant (adjusted OR = 1.77), smear-positivity at treatment onset (adjusted OR = 1.94) and not receiving 3 or more potentially effective drugs (adjusted OR = 3.87). Independent risk factors associated with poor treatment outcomes in XDR-TB patients were smear-positivity at treatment onset (adjusted OR = 10.42) and not receiving 3 or more potentially effective drugs (adjusted OR = 14.90). The independent risk factors associated with death in TB patients were having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adjusted HR = 5.25) and having hypertension (adjusted HR = 4.31).While overall satisfactory treatment success for non-MDR-TB patients was achieved, more intensive efforts should be made to better manage MDR- and XDR-TB cases in order to improve their treatment outcomes and to minimize further emergence of so-called totally drug-resistant TB cases.},

  Abstract                 = {This study was to explore the relationships between personal exposure to 10 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and biochemical liver tests with the application of canonical correlation analysis. Data from a subsample of the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used. Serum albumin, total bilirubin (TB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) served as the outcome variables. Personal exposures to benzene, chloroform, ethylbenzene, tetrachloroethene, toluene, trichloroethene, o-xylene, m-,p-xylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) were assessed through the use of passive exposure monitors worn by study participants. The first two canonical correlations were 0.3218 and 0.2575, suggesting a positive correlation mainly between the six VOCs (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-,p-xylene, and MTBE) and the three biochemical liver tests (albumin, ALP, and GGT) and a positive correlation mainly between the two VOCs (1,4-dichlorobenzene and tetrachloroethene) and the two biochemical liver tests (LDH and TB). Subsequent multiple linear regressions show that exposure to benzene, toluene, or MTBE was associated with serum albumin, while exposure to tetrachloroethene was associated with LDH and total bilirubin. In conclusion, exposure to certain VOCs as a group or individually may influence certain biochemical liver test results in the general population.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the influence of weight-bearing activity on bone mass has been widely investigated in white women, few studies have been conducted in black, African populations. We investigated bone mineral density (BMD) in black South African women, with and without a history of load-carrying on the head. We also investigated whether load carrying may offer protection against low BMD in users of injectable progestin contraception (IPC). Participants were 32 black, South African women (22.4 +/- 3.2 years). Load carrying history was determined by questionnaire and interview; participants were grouped as load carriers (LC; n = 18) or non-load carriers (NLC; n = 14). Ten women were using IPC and 6 were load-carriers. Total body (TB), lumbar spine (LS) and total hip (H) BMD were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. There were no differences in BMD between LC and NLC, and after controlling for age and BMI using two-tailed partial correlations. IPC users had lower BMD at all sites compared to non-IPC users (p < 0.05) and there were no associations between load carrying and BMD in this group. When IPC users were excluded from analysis, LC had higher LS BMD than NLC (p < 0.005). Correlations were found between the weight of load carried and LS BMD (r = 0.743, p < 0.005), and between years of load carrying and LS and TB BMD (r = 0.563, r = 0.538, respectively; both p < 0.05). Load carrying on the head may offer osteogenic benefits to the spine but these benefits did not appear in women using IPC.},

The current vaccine M. bovis Calmette-Guérin (BCG) demonstrates variable efficacy and so a more robust strategy to either replace, or more likely supplement it, is required. Prime-boost strategies where immunity induced by BCG is boosted by a second heterologous vaccine represent a promising avenue of research. We have evaluated the ability of a protein subunit vaccine using the antigen Rv3019c to either prime or boost immunity induced by BCG in a murine M. bovis challenge model. Despite the induction of anamnestic T cell responses, we report that antigen-independent immune stimulation with adjuvant in conjunction with BCG could enhance the level of protection induced by BCG alone. Importantly this improved protection correlated with pre-infection frequencies of ex vivo IFN-gamma producing cells in the spleen, providing a possible surrogate correlate of protection for future vaccination studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluoroquinolones are important second-line drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis. A comprehensive profile of resistance mutation patterns of DNA gyrase, the major target of fluoroquinolones, is crucial for molecular diagnosis of drug resistance and improvement of treatment efficacy. To investigate the mutation types of the genes encoding the A and B subunits of DNA gyrase (gyrA and gyrB, respectively) in ofloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains prevalent in mainland China, 177 clinical drug-resistant isolates collected by the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory of China were analysed. The GyrB single mutations (Glu498 and Gly551) and double mutation (Thr539Asn-Gly551Arg) as well as a GyrA double mutation (Asp94Asn-Gly112His) were reported to be involved in fluoroquinolone resistance for the first time. To simplify quantification of the contribution of each mutation type and mutation site to overall fluoroquinolone resistance, a mathematical method was established by assigning each resistance allele a numerical score between 5 and 50 (the larger the number, the higher the resistance level). The score of double mutants is the sum of the scores for the two single alleles. The double mutation types, including Asn538Ile(GyrB)-Asp94Ala(GyrA), Ala543Val(GyrB)-Asp94Asn(GyrA) and Ala543Val(GyrB)-Asp94Gly(GyrA) scored relatively high by this methodology.},

Diabetes is a risk factor for acquisition of and worse outcomes from A. baumannii infection. We sought to develop diabetic mouse models of A. baumannii bacteraemia and pneumonia and validate these models by comparing the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in these models with the established neutropenic mouse models.Diabetic or neutropenic mice were infected via intravenous inoculation or inhalation in an aerosol chamber with an XDR A. baumannii. Treatment with colistin started 24 h after infection and continued daily for 7 days. Survival served as the primary endpoint while tissue bacterial burden and histopathological examination served as secondary endpoints.Lethal infection was achieved for the neutropenic and diabetic mice when infected intravenously or via inhalation. Neutropenic mice were more susceptible to infection than diabetic mice in the pneumonia model and equally susceptible in the bacteraemia model. Both models of bacteraemia were sensitive enough to detect virulence differences among different clinical strains of A. baumannii. In the pneumonia model, colistin treatment was effective in improving survival, reducing lung bacterial burden and histologically resolving the infection compared with placebo only in diabetic mice.We developed novel models of A. baumannii bacteraemia and pneumonia in diabetic mice. These models can be used to study mechanisms of infection, develop immunotherapeutic strategies and evaluate drug efficacies against highly lethal A. baumannii infections.},

Enzymatic hydrolysis with pancreatic RNase, followed by anion-exchange chromatography, confirms the site of attachment of the spin-label. Effective rotational correlation times, TB and TC, have been determined from electron spin resonance (ESR) peak heights and widths as a function of temperature for each MSL RNA, and Arrhenius plots of -log T vs. 1/T have been constructed. TC is a measure of internal flexibility at the link between the label and the RNA, while TB is a measure of rotational flexibility of the RNA near the labeled site. Validity of the TB and TC determination has been confirmed from simulation of the experimental EPR spectra by theoretical spectra computed for various attachment geometries and motional rates. Discontinuities in the slope of Arrhenius plots for TB were seen at 34 and 66 degrees C (yeast MSL tRNA), 37 and 60 degrees C (E. coli MSL 5S RNA), 37 and 57 degrees C (yeast MSL 5S RNA), and 36 and 54 degrees C (wheat germ MSL 5S RNA). Temperature-induced hydrolysis of each MSL RNA was less than 5\% as determined by gel-filtration chromatography. The melting curves are consistent with a recently proposed universal secondary structural model for prokaryotic and eukaryotic 5S RNA.},

Additional and sustainable efforts, and funding are needed to further improve the pipeline. The key challenges in the development of new treatments are the needs for novel drug combinations, new trial designs, studies in paediatric populations, increased clinical trial capacity, clear regulatory guidelines, and biomarkers for prediction of long-term outcome. Despite substantial progress in efforts to control tuberculosis, the global burden of this disease remains high. To eliminate tuberculosis as a public health concern by 2050, all responsible parties need to work together to strengthen the global antituberculosis drug pipeline and support the development of new antituberculosis drug regimens.},

Developed by a broad coalition of partners, the plan presents a model approach combining interventions that can feasibly be supplied on the ground. The main areas of activity set out in the plan are: scaling up interventions to control tuberculosis; promoting the research and development of improved diagnostics, drugs and vaccines; and engaging in related activities for advocacy, communications and social mobilization. Scenarios for the planning process were developed; these looked at issues both globally and in seven epidemiological regions. The scenarios made ambitious but realistic assumptions about the pace of scale-up and implementation coverage of the activities. A mathematical model was used to estimate the impact of scaling up current interventions based on data from studies of tuberculosis biology and from experience with tuberculosis control in diverse settings. The estimated costs of the activities set out in the Global Plan were based on implementing interventions and researching and developing drugs, diagnostics and vaccines; these costs were US$ 56 billion over 10 years. When translated into cost per disability adjusted life year averted, these costs compare favourably with those of other public health interventions. This approach to planning for global tuberculosis control is a valuable example of developing plans to improve global health that has relevance for other health issues.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study was to use high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging combined with image analysis to investigate the three-dimensional (3D) trabecular structure, anisotropy, and connectivity of human vertebral, femoral, and calcaneal specimens. The goal was to determine whether: (a) MR-derived measures depict known skeletal-site-specific differences in architecture and orientation of trabeculae; (b) 3D architectural parameters combined with bone mineral density (BMD) improve the prediction of the elastic modulus using a fabric tensor formulation; (c) MR-derived 3D architectural parameters combined with BMD improve the prediction of strength using a multiple regression model, and whether these results corresponded to the results obtained using higher resolution depictions of trabecular architecture. A total of 94 specimens (12 x 12 x 12 mm cubes) consisting of trabecular bone only were obtained, of which there were 7 from the calcaneus, 15 from distal femur, 47 from the proximal femur, and 25 from the vertebral bodies. MR images were obtained using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner at a spatial resolution of 117 x 117 x 300 microm. Additionally, BMD was determined using quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and the specimens were nondestructively tested and the elastic modulus (YM) was measured along three orthogonal axes corresponding to the anatomic superior-inferior (axial), medial-lateral (sagittal), and anterior-posterior (coronal) directions. A subset of the specimens (n=67) was then destructively tested in the superior-inferior (axial) direction to measure the ultimate compressive strength. The MR images were segmented into bone and marrow phases and then analyzed in 3D. Ellipsoids were fitted to the mean intercept lengths, using single value decomposition and the primary orientation of the trabeculae and used to calculate the anisotropy of trabecular architecture. Stereological measures were derived using a previously developed model and measures such as mean trabecular width, spacing, and number were derived. Because the spatial resolution of MR images is comparable to trabecular bone dimensions, these measures may be subject to partial volume effects and were thus treated as apparent measures, such as BV/TV, Tb.Sp, Tb.N, and Tb.Th rather than absolute measures, as would be derived from histomorphometry. In addition, in a subset of specimens, the Euler number per unit volume was determined to characterize the connectivity of the trabecular network. There were significant differences in the BMD, trabecular architectural measures, elastic modulus, and strength at the different skeletal sites. The primary orientation axes for most of the specimens was the anatomic superior-inferior (axial) direction. Using the fabric tensor formulation, in addition to BMD, improved the prediction of YM (SI), while including some of the architectural parameters significantly improved the prediction of strength. In comparing MR-derived 3D measures with those obtained from 20 microm optical images (n=18; 9 vertebrae, 9 femur specimens), good correlations were found for the apparent Tb.Sp and Tb.N, moderate correlation was seen for the apparent BV/TV, and poor correlation was found for the apparent Tb.Th. Using these higher resolution images, the fabric tensor formulation for predicting the elastic modulus also showed improved correlation between the measured and calculated modulus in the axial (SI) direction. In summary, high-resolution MR images may be used to assess 3D architecture of trabecular bone, and the inclusion of some of the 3D architectural measures provides an improved assessment of biomechanical properties. Further studies are clearly warranted to establish the role of architecture in predicting overall bone quality, and the role of trabecular architecture measures in clinical practice.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2002 showed how air travel can have an important role in the rapid spread of newly emerging infections and could potentially even start pandemics. In addition to the flight crew, public health officials and health care professionals have an important role in the management of infectious diseases transmitted on airlines and should be familiar with guidelines provided by local and international authorities.},

Data on time trends in tuberculosis case notification rates and on HIV infection prevalence in adults and in tuberculosis patients were used, along with data on tuberculosis control programme performance.In 2006, the estimated smear-positive tuberculosis CDR in HIV-negative adults was 79\% (95\% confidence interval, CI: 64-94) and in HIV-positive adults, 57\% (95\% CI: 26-88), giving a weighted mean of 68\% (95\% CI: 49-87). The separate estimate for all smear-positive tuberculosis cases was 72\% (95\% CI: 53-91), giving an overall average for the three estimates of 70\% (95\% CI: 58-82). As the tuberculosis CDR in 1996 was 57\% (95\% CI: 47-67), the estimated increase by 2006 was 13 percentage points (95\% CI: 6-20), or 23\%. This increase was accompanied by a more than doubling of the resources devoted to tuberculosis control in Kenya, including facilities and staff.Using three approaches to estimate the tuberculosis CDR in a country where HIV infection is prevalent, we showed that expansion of the tuberculosis control programme in Kenya led to an increase of 23\% in the CDR between 1996 and 2006. While the methods developed here can be applied in other countries with a high prevalence of HIV infection, they rely on precise data on trends in such prevalence in the general population and among tuberculosis patients.},

  Abstract                 = {The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is complex. Experimental evidence has revealed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays a major role in host defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of infection. TNF-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB), in accordance with animal studies. The present study takes a computational approach toward characterizing the role of TNF in protection against the tubercle bacillus in both active and latent infection. We extend our previous mathematical models to investigate the roles and production of soluble (sTNF) and transmembrane TNF (tmTNF). We analyze effects of anti-TNF therapy in virtual clinical trials (VCTs) by simulating two of the most commonly used therapies, anti-TNF antibody and TNF receptor fusion, predicting mechanisms that explain observed differences in TB reactivation rates. The major findings from this study are that bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor for causing reactivation of latent infection and that sTNF--even at very low levels--is essential for control of infection. Using a mathematical model, it is possible to distinguish mechanisms of action of the anti-TNF treatments and gain insights into the role of TNF in TB control and pathology. Our study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed that could balance the requirement for reduction of inflammation with the necessity to maintain resistance to infection and microbial diseases. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-TNF therapy could be modified. Anti-TNF therapy will likely lead to numerous incidents of primary TB if used in areas where exposure is likely.},

  Abstract                 = {Diferric transferrin was modified using aquopentaammine ruthenium(II), a reagent for surface-accessible uncoordinated histidines. Introduction of the cationic Ru(III) (NH3)3 + 5 group on the imidazole of only 5.5 of the 17 uncoordinated histidines enhances the rates of pyrophosphate-assisted iron removal from the N-terminal and C-terminal binding sites by 16- and 2-fold, respectively. This differential effect on the kinetics of the two sites may partially explain why in the native protein the N-terminal site is more labile than the C-terminal site in acidic solutions where histidine residues become positively charged through protonation. The distance between the metal site and nearby uncoordinated histidines was estimated from fluorescence energy transfer measurements using Tb (III) as the donor and pentaammine ruthenium(III)-labeled imidazole of histidine as the acceptor chromophore. A Tsou Chen-Lu statistical analysis of the fluorescence quenching data suggest that two residues in each lobe of the protein are involved in quenching the fluorescence. By using estimates for the index of refraction and the quantum yield and assuming the energy transfer follows parallel first-order kinetics, an upper limit for the donor-acceptor distance of about 1.4 nm was obtained, assuming two uncoordinated histidine residues equidistant from the metal. His-207 and His-242 in the N-terminal lobe of transferrin and His-535 and His-577 in the C-terminal lobe are within this distance, based on information from the lactoferrin crystal structure. It is postulated that His-207 in the N-terminal lobe and His-535 in the C-terminal lobe are the uncoordinated residues that, when protonated or modified with Ru(III) (NH3)3 + 5, lead to accelerated loss of iron from the two binding sites of the protein.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work we study a plankton ecosystem model in a turbulent flow. The plankton model we consider contains logistic growth with a spatially varying background carrying capacity and the flow dynamics are generated using the two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations. We characterize the system in terms of a dimensionless parameter, gamma identical with TB/TF, which is the ratio of the ecosystem biological time scales TB and the flow time scales TF. We integrate this system numerically for different values of gamma until the mean plankton reaches a statistically stationary state and examine how the steady-state mean and variance of plankton depends on gamma. Overall we find that advection in the presence of a nonuniform background carrying capacity can lead to very different plankton distributions depending on the time scale ratio gamma. For small gamma the plankton distribution is very similar to the background carrying capacity field and has a mean concentration close to the mean carrying capacity. As gamma increases the plankton concentration is more influenced by the advection processes. In the largest gamma cases there is a homogenization of the plankton concentration and the mean plankton concentration approaches the harmonic mean, <1/K>(-1). We derive asymptotic approximations for the cases of small and large gamma. We also look at the dependence of the power spectra exponent, beta, on gamma where the power spectrum of plankton is proportional to k(-beta). We find that the power spectra exponent closely obeys beta=1+2/gamma as predicted by earlier studies using simple models of chaotic advection.},

  Abstract                 = {With >8 million new cases in 2010, particularly documented in developing countries, tuberculosis (TB) is still a highly present pandemic and often terminal. This is also due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains (MDR-TB and XDR-TB) of the primary causative TB agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Efforts to develop new effective drugs against MTB are restrained by the unique and largely impermeable composition of the mycobacterial cell wall.Based on a database of antimycobacterial substances (CDD TB), 3815 compounds were classified as active and thus permeable. A data mining approach was conducted to gather the physico-chemical similarities of these substances and delimit them from a generic dataset of drug-like molecules. On the basis of the differences in these datasets, a regression model was generated and implemented into the online tool MycPermCheck to predict the permeability probability of small organic compounds. Discussion: Given the current lack of precise molecular criteria determining mycobacterial permeability, MycPermCheck represents an unprecedented prediction tool intended to support antimycobacterial drug discovery. It follows a novel knowledge-driven approach to estimate the permeability probability of small organic compounds. As such, MycPermCheck can be used intuitively as an additional selection criterion for potential new inhibitors against MTB. Based on the validation results, its performance is expected to be of high practical value for virtual screening purposes.The online tool is freely accessible under the URL http://www.mycpermcheck.aksotriffer.pharmazie.uni-wuerzburg.de},

  Abstract                 = {The objectives of this study were to estimate response to divergent selection for an index of placental efficiency in swine, and to evaluate the effect of placental efficiency on litter size. The selection index (SI) included total born (TB), birth weight (BRWT), and placental weight (PW), and was designed to increase in the high line (H) or decrease in the low line (L) the efficiency of the placental function (PE), defined as the ratio BRWT:PW. (Co)variance components were estimated for direct and maternal additive effects by using an animal model with MTDFREML procedures. Estimated breeding values were calculated by using records on individual BRWT (n = 2,111), PW (n = 2,006), PE (n = 1,677), and SI (n = 1,677). Litter traits were evaluated using records on 193 litters. The model included the fixed effects of contemporary group for all traits, with the addition of sex for individual traits and parity for litter traits. Litter was fitted as an uncorrelated random effect for all traits, and TB was used as a linear and quadratic covariate for BRWT, PW, and PE. Direct heritability estimates from single-trait models were 0.03, 0.25, 0.18, 0.11, and 0.08 for BRWT, PW, PE, SI, and TB, respectively. Estimated breeding values were compared between lines by using a model including generation, line within generation, and replicate within line as the error term. Estimates of genetic divergence were 20.7 +/- 2.7 g, 0.24 +/- 0.03, 0.11 +/- 0.02, and 0.07 +/- 0.02 per generation for PW, PE, SI, and TB, respectively (P < 0.01), but divergence was not significant for BRWT. At Generation 4, direct EBV was higher in L than in H for PW (55.9 +/- 8.7 vs. -24.2 +/- 9.5 g, respectively; P < 0.01) and higher in H than in L for PE (0.58 +/- 0.10 vs. -0.35 +/- 0.09 g, respectively; P < 0.01). However, EBV was not different for BRWT, SI, or TB. These results indicate that PW and PE are susceptible to change by genetic selection; however, the correlated response in TB was an unexpected genetic trend toward a higher TB in L of 0.05 +/- 0.01 piglets per generation (P < 0.01).},

  Abstract                 = {Childhood rubella infection in early pregnancy can lead to fetal death or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) with multiple disabilities. Reduction of transmission via universal vaccination can prevent CRS, but inadequate coverage may increase CRS numbers by increasing the average age at infection. Consequently, many countries do not vaccinate against rubella. The World Health Organization recommends that for safe rubella vaccination, at least 80\% coverage of each birth cohort should be sustained. The nonlinear relationship between CRS burden and infection dynamics has been much studied; however, how the complex interaction between epidemic and demographic dynamics affects minimum safe levels of coverage has not been quantitatively evaluated across scales necessary for a global assessment. We modelled 30-year CRS burdens across epidemiological and demographic settings, including the effect of local interruption of transmission via stochastic fadeout. Necessary minimum vaccination coverage increases markedly with birth and transmission rates, independent of amplitude of seasonal fluctuations in transmission. Susceptible build-up in older age groups following local stochastic extinction of rubella increased CRS burden, indicating that spatial context is important. In low birth-rate settings, 80\% routine coverage is a conservative guideline, particularly if supplemented with campaigns and vaccination of women of childbearing age. Where birth and transmission rates are high, immunization coverage must be well above 80\% and campaigns may be needed. Policy-makers should be aware of the potential negative effect of local extinction of rubella, since heterogeneity in vaccination coverage will shape extinction patterns, potentially increasing CRS burdens.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently, no information is available on the effect of resistance/susceptibility to first-line drugs different from isoniazid and rifampicin in determining the outcome of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) patients, and whether being XDR-TB is a more accurate indicator of poor clinical outcome than being resistant to all first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs. To investigate this issue, a large series of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and XDR-TB cases diagnosed in Estonia, Germany, Italy and the Russian Federation during the period 1999-2006 were analysed. Drug-susceptibility testing for first- and second-line anti-TB drugs, quality assurance and treatment delivery was performed according to World Health Organization recommendations in all study sites. Out of 4,583 culture-positive TB cases analysed, 361 (7.9\%) were MDR and 64 (1.4\%) were XDR. XDR-TB cases had a relative risk (RR) of 1.58 to have an unfavourable outcome compared with MDR-TB cases resistant to all first-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin ethambutol, streptomycin and, when tested, pyrazinamide), and an RR of 2.61 compared with "other" MDR-TB cases (those susceptible to at least one first-line anti-TB drug among ethambutol, pyrazinamide and streptomycin, regardless of resistance to the second-line drugs not defining XDR-TB). The emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis confirms that problems in tuberculosis management are still present in Europe. While waiting for new tools which will facilitate management of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, accessibility to quality diagnostic and treatment services should be urgently ensured and adequate public health policies should be rapidly implemented to prevent further development of drug resistance.},

The emergence of the HIV epidemic has dramatically increased the risk of developing clinical TB in infected persons, substantially increasing TB rates globally. Preventive therapy with INH for 6 to 12 months substantially reduces the risk of developing clinical TB in persons with tuberculous infection. Yet, preventive therapy is not fully used because of lack of knowledge about TB among health care professionals, patient nonadherence with preventive therapy regimens, and drug toxicity. Persons at high risk for developing TB should be screened for infection with a tuberculin skin test and given preventive therapy when appropriate. Promising new regimens of shorter duration and new drug delivery systems are currently being evaluated. Preventive therapy must be widely adopted if the goals of TB control and eventual elimination are to be achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis (TB) control is especially difficult in settings of high HIV prevalence; HIV co-infection erodes host immunity and increases risk of progression to active TB. Studies have demonstrated that a 6-month (or longer) course of monotherapy with isoniazid [isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT)] can reduce this risk. The World Health Organization endorses IPT for symptom-free individuals with HIV/TB co-infection and has recommended expanding IPT to entire communities (community-wide IPT). Although previous reviews have not found a statistically significant elevated risk of isoniazid-resistant TB among individuals previously treated with IPT, community-wide IPT programs may nonetheless generate substantial selective pressure and increase the burden of drug-resistant TB (DRTB). We developed mathematical models to identify the conditions under which community-wide IPT interventions could increase the burden of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, even when we assumed that IPT does not select for resistance among those treated with IPT. We found that in models that included any mechanism of interstrain competition (such as partial immunity conferred by a previous M. tuberculosis infection), community-wide IPT interventions conferred an indirect benefit to drug-resistant strains through selective suppression of drug-sensitive infections. This result suggests that the absence of an observed elevation in the risk of DRTB among those receiving IPT in small-scale studies of limited duration does not imply that the selective pressure imposed by community-wide IPT will not be substantial. Community-wide IPT may play an important role in TB control in these settings, and its rollout should be accompanied by interventions to detect and treat drug-resistant disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Simple, rapid, and affordable tests are needed to detect drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the accuracy of microscopic-observation drug susceptibility (MODS) and thin layer agar (TLA) assays for rapid screening of patients at risk of drug-resistant tuberculosis.In accordance with protocols and methods recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working Group, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Biosis for reports published between January, 1990, and February, 2009. We included studies investigating detection of drug resistance in M tuberculosis with the MODS or TLA assay, and in which an accepted reference standard was used. Data extracted from the studies were combined by use of bivariate random-effects regression models and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves to estimate sensitivity and specificity for detection of resistance to specific drugs.We identified 12 studies, of which nine investigated the MODS assay and three investigated the TLA assay. For the MODS assay of rifampicin resistance, pooled estimates were 98·0\% (95\% CI 94·5-99·3) for sensitivity and 99·4\% (95·7-99·9) for specificity. For the MODS assay of isoniazid resistance with a 0·1 μg/mL cutoff, pooled sensitivity was 97·7\% (94·4-99·1) and pooled specificity was 95·8\% (88·1-98·6), but with a 0·4 μg/mL cutoff, sensitivity decreased to 90·0\% (84·5-93·7) and specificity increased to 98·6\% (96·9-99·4). All assessments of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance with the TLA assay yielded 100\% accuracy. Mean turnaround time was 9·9 days (95\% CI 4·1-15·8) for the MODS assay and 11·1 days (10·1-12·0) for the TLA assay.MODS and TLA assays are inexpensive, rapid alternatives to conventional methods for drug susceptibility testing of M tuberculosis. Our data and expert opinion informed WHO's recommendation for use of selected non-commercial drug susceptibility tests, including MODS, as an interim solution until capacity for genotypic or automated liquid culture drug susceptibility testing is developed.Stop TB Department of WHO.},

  Abstract                 = {In the first paper, the superiority of linear FM signals was shown in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and robustness to tissue attenuation. This second paper in the series of three papers on the application of coded excitation signals in medical ultrasound presents design methods of linear FM signals and mismatched filters, in order to meet the higher demands on resolution in ultrasound imaging. It is shown that for the small time-bandwidth (TB) products available in ultrasound, the rectangular spectrum approximation is not valid, which reduces the effectiveness of weighting. Additionally, the distant range sidelobes are associated with the ripples of the spectrum amplitude and, thus, cannot be removed by weighting. Ripple reduction is achieved through amplitude or phase predistortion of the transmitted signals. Mismatched filters are designed to efficiently use the available bandwidth and at the same time to be insensitive to the transducer's impulse response. With these techniques, temporal sidelobes are kept below 60 to 100 dB, image contrast is improved by reducing the energy within the sidelobe region, and axial resolution is preserved. The method is evaluated first for resolution performance and axial sidelobes through simulations with the program Field II. A coded excitation ultrasound imaging system based on a commercial scanner and a 4 MHz probe driven by coded sequences is presented and used for the clinical evaluation of the coded excitation/compression scheme. The clinical images show a significant improvement in penetration depth and contrast, while they preserve both axial and lateral resolution. At the maximum acquisition depth of 15 cm, there is an improvement of more than 10 dB in the signal-to-noise ratio of the images. The paper also presents acquired images, using complementary Golay codes, that show the deleterious effects of attenuation on binary codes when processed with a matched filter, also confirmed by presented simulated images.},

We reviewed scientific and non-scientific literature on transmission of airborne pathogens in public ground transport and on factors potentially influencing transmission. We identified 32 relevant publications (15 scientific and 17 non-scientific). Most of the selected studies dealt with transmission of tuberculosis. However, the relation between travel duration, proximity to the index case and environmental factors, such as ventilation, on disease transmission in public ground transport is poorly understood. Considering the difficulty and probably limited effectiveness of CT in ground transport, our results suggest that only exceptional circumstances would justify CT. This contrasts with the high level of attention CT in air travel seems to receive in international regulations and recommendations. We question whether the indication for CT should be revisited after a risk–benefit assessment that takes into account exposure in both ground and air transport.},

  Abstract                 = {Basic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) features of 23Na ions bound to the gramicidin channel (packaged into lecithin liposomes) were studied. The first binding constant K1 of Na+ was not significantly dependent on channel models employed. With the two-identical-site model (Model I), K1 was 13.7 (+/- 1.4) molal-1 (in the activity basis) at 25 degrees C; when the binding of a third ion was included (Model II), it was 13.0 (+/- 2.0) molal-1. The second binding constant K2 was model dependent; it was 1.6 (+/- 0.2) and 3-4 molal-1 for Models I and II, respectively. The rate constants, k-1 and k-2, of Na+ for exit from singly and doubly loaded channels, respectively, were 8 X 10(5) s-1 less than or equal to k-1 less than or equal to 3 X 10(6) s-1 and 8 X 10(5) s-1 less than or equal to k-2 less than or equal to 1.0 X 10(7) s-1 at 25 degrees C; the lower bound represents a rough approximation of k-1. The ratio k-2/k-1 was greater than one and did not greatly exceed 20. From the competition experiment, K1 of T1+ was 5.7 (+/- 0.6) X 10(2) molal-1. The longitudinal relaxation time T1 of bound 23Na in the state of single occupancy (T 1B sing) was virtually independent of models, 0.56 (+/- 0.03) and 0.55 (+/- 0.04) ms at 25 degrees C for Models I and II, respectively. For the state of double occupancy, T1 of bound 23Na (T 1B doub) was model dependent: 0.27 (+/- 0.01) and 0.4-0.6 ms for Models I and II. The correlation time tau c of bound 23Na was 2.2 (+/- 0.2) ns at 25 degrees C for single occupancy; tau c for double occupancy was not significantly different from this value. The estimated tau c was found to involve no appreciable contribution of the exchange of 23Na between the channel and the bulk solution. Thé quadrupole coupling constant chi was 1.0 (+/- 0.1) MHz for 23Na in single occupancy; chi for double occupancy was 0.9-1.4 MHz, depending on models. A lower bound of the average quadrupole coupling constant chi alpha was 0.13-0.26 MHz at 25 degrees C for 23Na in single occupancy; this value represents a rough approximation of chi alpha at this temperature. An argument based on the estimated chi alpha and the known conformation of the gramicidin channel suggests that the binding site is a small domain near the channel end. Within the framework of Model I, Tb was faster than Tljn; this inequality was attributed to an increased chi in the presence ofa second cation, which was not explained in terms of electrostatic interactions between bound cations, implying a conformation change upon binding of cations.},

  Abstract                 = {Identifying how social determinants of health (SDH) influence the burden of disease in communities and populations is critically important to determine how to target public health interventions and move toward health equity. A holistic approach to disease prevention involves understanding the combined effects of individual, social, health system, and environmental determinants on geographic area-based disease burden. Using 2006-2008 gonorrhea surveillance data from the National Notifiable Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance and SDH variables from the American Community Survey, we calculated the diagnosis rate for each geographic area and analyzed the associations between those rates and the SDH and demographic variables. The estimated product moment correlation (PMC) between gonorrhea rate and SDH variables ranged from 0.11 to 0.83. Proportions of the population that were black, of minority race/ethnicity, and unmarried, were each strongly correlated with gonorrhea diagnosis rates. The population density, female proportion, and proportion below the poverty level were moderately correlated with gonorrhea diagnosis rate. To better understand relationships among SDH, demographic variables, and gonorrhea diagnosis rates, more geographic area-based estimates of additional variables are required. With the availability of more SDH variables and methods that distinguish linear from non-linear associations, geographic area-based analysis of disease incidence and SDH can add value to public health prevention and control programs.},

To determine if transmission had occurred, passengers and crew were notified of the potential exposure and instructed to undergo a tuberculin skin test (TST). Of the 240 persons who completed screening, 4 (2\%) had a documented TST conversion (increase in induration of > or = 10 mm between successive TSTs), 11 (5\%) had a single positive TST (> or = 10 mm), and 225 (94\%) had a negative TST (< 10 mm). For two persons who underwent conversion, no other risk factors for a conversion were identified other than exposure to the ill passenger during train and/or bus travel.

  Abstract                 = {The object of the study was to explain the differences in bilirubin level in various experimental jaundice models. The Bil constituents in conjugated hyperbilirubinemic dog models were identified. Total Bil was measured using the Jendrassik and Grof method and direct spectrophotometry. Conjugated and unconjugated Bil were measured using the Weber-Schalm extraction method. Bilirubin covalently bound to albumin was measured indirectly from the total Bil and the non-CBBA fraction. The non-CBBA was estimated either as the sum of the CB and UCB concentrations determined by the W-S method or as the nonprecipitated fraction after deproteinization with ammonium sulfate-saturated ethanol when using DS. The TB, CB, UCB, and CBBA levels were compared in two hyperbilirubinemic dog models: chronic bile duct ligation (CBDL) and internal choledochocaval anastomosis (CDCA). The mean TB in internal CDCA (16.5 +/- 3.67 mg\%) was significantly higher than in CBDL (3.4 +/- 1.75 mg\%). Most of the serum Bil in these two models was conjugated, 13.4 +/- 2.24 and 3.2 +/- 1.7 mg\%, respectively. No CBBA was found in the CBDL or in the partially obstructed internal-CDCA dogs. The TB in an external-CDCA model was essentially similar to the internal-CDCA model. The indirect Bil level in the external-CDCA model was six to seven times higher than the UCB level, and the CBBA level varied between 30 and 80\% of the TB. Up to 50\% CBBA was found also in patients with intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. The findings indicate that, unlike the commonly assumed hypothesis, the serum TB level in the CDCA models, which was higher than in the CBCL one, is not due to high UCB levels. Rather, hyperbilirubinemia in the external-CDCA model is due to increased levels of CBBA or, perhaps, to variations in the amount and/or composition of CB entering the blood and cleared by the kidney.},

We did a systematic review to determine the yield of household contact investigation. The yield for all tuberculosis (bacteriologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed) was 4.5\% (95\% CI 4.3-4.8, I(2)=95.5\%) of contacts investigated; for cases with bacteriological confirmation the yield was 2.3\% (95\% CI 2.1-2.5, I(2)=96.6\%). Latent tuberculosis infection was found in 51.4\% (95\% CI 50.6-52.2, I(2)=99.4\%) of contacts investigated. The substantial heterogeneity in all analyses indicated high variability among studies that was not accounted for by subgroup analyses. These results suggest that contact investigation merits serious consideration as a means to improve early case detection and decrease transmission of M tuberculosis in high-incidence areas.},

Many crucial management issues in MDR-TB treatment remain unanswered. We reviewed the existing scientific research on MDR-TB treatment, which consists entirely of retrospective cohort studies. Although direct comparisons of these studies are impossible, some insights can be gained: MDR-TB can and should be addressed therapeutically in resource-poor settings; starting of treatment early is crucial; aggressive treatment regimens and high-end dosing are recommended given the lower potency of second-line antituberculosis drugs; and strategies to improve treatment adherence, such as directly observed therapy, should be used. Opportunities to treat MDR-TB in developing countries are now possible through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, and the Green Light Committee for Access to Second-line Anti-tuberculosis Drugs. As treatment of MDR-TB becomes increasingly available in resource-poor areas, where it is needed most, further clinical and operational research is urgently needed to guide clinicians in the management of this disease.},

A total of 187 HIV/TB deaths were observed among 16,844 children aged 1-5 years coming from 8,863 households. In this paper we used Bayesian models to assess risk factors for child HIV/TB mortality taking into account the presence of spatial correlation. Bayesian zero inflated spatiotemporal models were able to detect hidden patterns within the data. Our main finding was that maternal orphans experienced a threefold greater risk of HIV/TB death compared to those with living mothers (AHR=2.93, 95\% CI[1.29;6.93]). Risk factor analyses which adjust for person, place and time provide evidence for policy makers that includes a spatial distribution of risk. Child survival is dependent on the mother's survival; hence programs that promote maternal survival are critical.},

The World Health Organization estimates that there are 200,000 cases of YF annually, including 30,000 deaths, of which over 90\% occur in Africa. In the past 15 years, the number of YF cases has increased tremendously, with most of the YF activity in West Africa. This increase in YF activity is in part due to a breakdown in YF vaccination and mosquito control programs. Five genotypes of YF virus have been found in Africa, and each genotype circulates in a distinct geographical region. West Africa genotype I, found in Nigeria and surrounding areas, is associated with frequent epidemics, whereas the three genotypes in East and Central Africa are in regions where YF outbreaks are rare. Other factors, including genetic and behavioral variation among vector species, are also thought to play a role in the epidemiology of YF in Africa.},

Even as efforts to broadly implement conventional TB transmission control measures begin, current strategies may be incompletely effective under the overcrowded conditions extant in high-burden, resource-limited settings. Longstanding evidence suggesting that TB patients on effective therapy rapidly become non-infectious and that unsuspected, untreated TB cases account for the most transmission makes a strong case for the implementation of rapid point-of-care diagnostics coupled with fully supervised effective treatment. Among the most important decisions affecting transmission, the choice of an MDR-TB treatment model that includes community-based treatment may offer important advantages over hospital or clinic-based care, not only in cost and effectiveness, but also in transmission control. In the community, too, rapid identification of infectious cases, especially drug-resistant cases, followed by effective, fully supervised treatment, is critical to stopping transmission. Among the conventional interventions available, we present a simple triage and separation strategy, point out that separation is intimately linked to the design and engineering of clinical space and call attention to the pros and cons of natural ventilation, simple mechanical ventilation systems, germicidal ultraviolet air disinfection, fit-tested respirators on health care workers and short-term use of masks on patients before treatment is initiated.},

  Abstract                 = {Mass immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) was begun in the United States in 1963, and the least natural outbreak of poliomyelitis occurred in 1972. Since immunization programs fail to reach the total population, eradication has been achieved in the presence of a residual susceptible population of at least 5\% (2-5 million children under the age of 15 years). It is proposed that the fade-out of wild polioviruses is explained by their disappearance during the winter, a low point in the yearly cycle of the virus. In the post-eradication era, the continued presence of millions of susceptible children and adults presents a constant potential hazard. Every effort should be made to maintain maximal levels of immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine and to prevent the reintroduction of wild polioviruses into the United States.Drawing largely upon recent discussions, this summary addresses 2 main points: how the US succeeded in eradicating poliovirus; and the relative roles of inactivated (IPV) and attenuated (OPV) poliovirus vaccine in eradication. Figure 1, which gives the reported cases of paralytic poliomyelitis in the US over the 1951-77 period, shows that the incidence dropped from 10,000-20,000 cases/year in the early 1950s to a current level of around 10 cases/year. Figure 2, which presents evidence for the 1970-78 period, indicates that cases occurring in the last decade have been either vaccine-associated or imported. There are 2 alternative explanations for the dramatic and largely unpredicted disappearance of poliomyelitis: either all susceptibles have been immunized; or wild virus has been eradicated. National health surveys suggest that 5-10\% of the population under age 14 has not received OPV. This does not represent a true estimate of the susceptible population, for OPV spreads to contacts of recipients who may be immunized in this way. Even though the available data fail to provide a precise estimate, they suggest that there is a residual susceptible population in the US that may be conservatively estimated to include at least 5-10\% of children under age 14. This observation supports the inference that wild poliovirus has been eradicated in the US and raises another question, i.e., how was poliomyelitis eradicated while retaining a residual population of susceptibles. This question has not been investigated adequately. A major factor in eradication is seasonality. Table 2 presents a hypothetical reconstruction of the preimmunization situation in a population of 1 million. With an estimated 20,000 infections/year, seasonality was such at the trough period only 1/1000 of the total infections for the year would occur in 1 generation period, i.e., 20 infections. Following widespread use of OPV, there were regional fadeouts during trough periods, but unlike the situation with measles, there was no reintroduction of virus into those areas where fadeout had occurred. In sum, a difference in the probability of transmission over long distances may be crucial in explaining the divergent impact of measles and poliomyelitis vaccines. To consider poliovirus vaccines in the context of poliomyelitis eradication, Figure 5 and Table 6 review some of the advantages and disadvantages of the 2 vaccines.},

  Abstract                 = {The purposes of this study are to predict the future trend of drug-sensitive and resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Thailand, and to assess the impact of different control strategies on the generation of drug resistant TB, through the use of mathematical analysis. We assume that the present status of TB and the emergence of drug-resistant TB in Thailand are the consequence of past epidemics. Control strategies in the model are defined by specifying the value of the effective treatment rate (baseline value = 0.74) and the relative treatment efficacy (baseline value = 0.84). It is predicted that the total number of new TB cases would continue to decrease at the current level of intervention. Although a dramatic decline in the incidence rate of drug-sensitive cases is expected, drug-resistant cases are predicted to increase gradually, so that more than half of the TB strains would not be drug-sensitive after 2020. The prediction is not greatly altered by improving the interventions. They could, however, delay the emergence of drug-resistant strains for a few years. Our study demonstrates it would be impossible to avoid the continued emergence of drug-resistant TB in the future. It is pointed out that there are urgent needs to ensure adequate supervision and monitoring, to insure treatment of 100\% of the targeted population with Directly Observed Therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite an increase in global measles vaccine coverage from under 20\% in 1980 to around 80\% in 1990, measles remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality world-wide. This paper addresses a number of issues relating to efforts to control measles, namely, (i) at the global level, how might we assess the impact of measles vaccination on the incidence of infection and associated disease, and, (ii), at the strategic level, how can we utilise an understanding of the transmission dynamics of childhood viral infections to aid the design of optimal immunisation programmes? Based on WHO vaccine coverage data, and organising countries according to similarities in demographic and epidemiological parameters, an age-structured model of measles transmission is used to capture the non-linear dynamics of infection and mass vaccination and to generate projections of the impact of measles immunization world-wide. The results provide a crude indication of the percentage reduction in measles cases by year 2000 (compared with no immunization) and suggest an approximately 70\% reduction in cases over all ages, and 77\% reduction in cases under 5 years (where there is the greatest risk of case fatality); these suggest that WHO targets for 1995 are unlikely to be achieved. In the second part of the paper, examples are given to illustrate the usefulness of a modelling approach in evaluating measles immunization policy. The introduction of MMR vaccine in the UK in 1988 has resulted in measles incidence falling to an all time low and attention has turned to the requirements of elimination. A realistic age structured model, validated using extensive serological data, is used to compare the merits of single or two dose strategies. Based upon recent estimates of vaccine efficacy (90\%) and coverage (92\% by end of second year of life) it is suggested that a two-dose policy with a pre-school second dose given irrespective of vaccine history is required to prevent the build up of susceptibles to epidemic proportions in the longer term. In a second example, prompted by the success of the campaign approach to polio and measles elimination in Central and South America, simple models are used to explore and quantify the process by which pulse vaccination programmes (i.e. repeated application across a wide age range) act to control transmission.},

  abstract    = {Ligand L, based on two do3a moieties linked by the methylene groups of 6,6'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine, was synthesized and characterized. The addition of Ln salts to an aqueous solution of L (0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) led to the successive formation of [LnL] and [Ln(2)L] complexes, as evidenced by UV/Vis and fluorescence titration experiments. Homodinuclear [Ln(2)L] complexes (Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb, Yb, and Lu) were prepared and characterized. The (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra of the Lu and Yb complexes in D(2)O solution (pD = 7.0) showed C(1) symmetry of these species in solution, pointing to two different chemical environments for the two lanthanide cations. The analysis of the chemical shifts of the Yb complex indicated that the two coordination sites present square antiprismatic (SAP) coordination environments around the metal ions. The spectroscopic properties of the [Tb(2)L] complex upon ligand excitation revealed conventional behavior with τ(H2O) = 2.05(1) ms and ϕ(H2O) = 51\%, except for the calculation of the hydration number obtained from the luminescent lifetimes in H(2)O and D(2)O, which pointed to a non-integer value of 0.6 water molecules per Tb(III) ion. In contrast, the Eu complex revealed surprising features such as: 1) the presence of two and up to five components in the (5)D(0)→(7)F(0) and (5)D(0)→(7)F(1) emission bands, respectively; 2) marked differences between the normalized spectra obtained in H(2)O and D(2)O solutions; and 3) unconventional temporal evolution of the luminescence intensity at certain wavelengths, the intensity profile first displaying a rising step before the occurrence of the expected decay. Additional spectroscopic experiments performed on [Gd(2-x)Eu(x)L] complexes (x = 0.1 and 1.9) confirmed the presence of two distinct Eu sites with hydration numbers of 0 (site I) and 2 (site II), and showed that the unconventional temporal evolution of the emission intensity is the result of an unprecedented intramolecular Eu-to-Eu energy-transfer process. A mathematical model was developed to interpret the experimental data, leading to energy-transfer rates of 0.98 ms(-1) for the transfer from the site with q=0 to that with q=2 and vice versa. Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed at the B3LYP level were used to investigate the conformation of the complex in solution, and to estimate the intermetallic distance, which provided Förster radii (R(0)) values of 8.1 Å for the energy transfer from site I to site II, and 6.8 Å for the reverse energy transfer. These results represent the first evidence of an intramolecular energy-transfer equilibrium between two identical lanthanide cations within a discrete molecular complex in solution.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: In France, there was a reluctance to accept vaccination against the A/H1N1 pandemic influenza virus despite government recommendation and investment in the vaccine programme. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined the willingness of different populations to accept A/H1N1 vaccination (i) in a French hospital among 3315 employees immunized either by in-house medical personnel or mobile teams of MDs and (ii) in a shelter housing 250 homeless persons. Google was used to assess the volume of enquiries concerning incidence of influenza. We analyzed the information on vaccination provided by Google, the website of the major French newspapers, and PubMed. Two trust Surveys were used to assess public opinion on the trustworthiness of people in different professions. Paramedics were significantly more reluctant to accept immunisation than qualified medical staff. Acceptance was significantly increased when recommended directly by MDs. Anecdotal cases of directly observed severe infections were followed by enhanced acceptance of paramedical staff. Scientific literature was significantly more in favour of vaccination than Google and French newspaper websites. In the case of the newspaper websites, information correlated with their recognised political reputations, although they would presumably claim independence from political bias. The Trust Surveys showed that politicians were highly dis-trusted in contrast with doctors and pharmacists who were considered much more trustworthy. CONCLUSIONS: The low uptake of the vaccine could reflect failure to convey high quality medical information and advice relating to the benefits of being vaccinated. We believe that the media and internet contributed to this problem by raising concerns within the general population and that failure to involve GPs in the control programme may have been a mistake. GPs are highly regarded by the public and can provide face-to-face professional advice and information. The top-down strategy of vaccine programme management and information delivered by the Ministry of Health could have aggravated the problem, because the general population does not always trust politicians.},

  Abstract                 = {Treatment of infections due to extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii often involves the use of antimicrobial agents in combination. Various combinations of agents have been proposed, with colistin serving as the backbone in many of them. Recent data suggest that glycopeptides, in particular vancomycin, may have unique activity against laboratory-adapted and clinical strains of A. baumannii, alone and in combination with colistin. The aim of the present study was to test this approach against three unique colistin-resistant A. baumannii clinical strains using combinations of vancomycin (VAN), colistin (COL), and doripenem (DOR). All three strains possessed the signature phosphoethanolamine modification of the lipid A moiety associated with colistin resistance and unique amino acid changes in the PmrAB two-component signal transduction system not observed in colistin-susceptible strains. In checkerboard assays, synergy (defined as a fractional inhibitory concentration index [FICI] of ≤ 0.5) was observed between COL and VAN for all three strains tested and between COL and DOR in two strains. In time-kill assays, the combinations of COL-DOR, COL-VAN, and COL-DOR-VAN resulted in complete killing of colistin-resistant A. baumannii in 1, 2, and all 3 strains, respectively. In the Galleria mellonella moth model of infection, the combinations of DOR-VAN and COL-DOR-VAN led to significantly increased survival of the larvae, compared with other combinations and monotherapy. These findings suggest that regimens containing vancomycin may confer therapeutic benefit for infection due to colistin-resistant A. baumannii.},

  Abstract                 = {CDC and ACET in U.S.A. reported that novel vaccines instead of BCG are required for the protection against infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis worldwide. However, no novel vaccine for clinical use has not yet been developed in the world including U.S.A. and Europe. We have developed a novel tuberculosis (TB) vaccine; a combination of the DNA vaccines expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (HSP65) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-envelope and -liposome (HSP65+IL-12/HVJ). This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse compared to the BCG vaccine on the basis of C.F.U of number of TB, survival, an induction of the CD8 positive CTL activity and improvement of the histopathological tuberculosis lesions. This vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) in murine models. Furthermore, we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis. This novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than BCG based upon the assessment of mortality, the ESR, body weight, chest X-ray findings and immune responses. Furthermore, the BCG priming and HSP65+IL-12/HVJ vaccine (booster) by the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkey (100\% survival). Furthermore, this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy (100\% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys. These data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful against Mycobacterium tuberculosis including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical trials. The review also provides recent advances of the precise studies of induction of immunity including CD8 positive cytotoxic T cells and effector molecules such as granulysin by these vaccines, against multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and extremely drug resistant tuberculosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (M.TB) is a big problem in the world. We have developed novel TB therapeutic vaccines.DNA vaccine expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 and IL-12 was delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-envelope. M. TB, MDR-TB or extremenly drug resistant (XDR-TB) was injected i.v. into DBA/1 mice, and treated with the vaccine three times. This HVJ-E/Hsp65DNA+IL-12DNA vaccine provided strong therapeutic efficacy against MDR-TB and XDR-TB (prolongation of survival time and the decrease in the number of TB) in mice. Therapeutic effect of this vaccine on TB infection was also demonstrated in chronic TB infection murine model using aerosol infection intratracheally. On the other hand, granulysin protein produced from CTL has lethal activity against TB. Granulysin protein vaccine also exerted strong therapeutic effect. Furthermore, we extended our studies to monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human TB. Hsp65DNA+IL-12 DNA vaccine exerted strong therapeutic efficacy (100\% survival and augmentation of immune responses) in the TB-infected monkeys. In contrast, the survival of the saline control group was 60\% at 16 week post-challenge. HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA vaccine increased the body weight of TB-infected monkeys, improved the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and augmentated the immune responses (proliferation of PBL and IL-2 production). The enhancement of IL-2 production from monkeys treated with this vaccine was correlated with the therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine. Conclusion: These data indicate that novel vaccines might be useful against TB including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical trials.},

Over 8.8 million new cases and nearly 2 million deaths by tuberculosis (TB) occur annually. TB poses a significant health threat to the world population. The goal of this symposium is to open new avenues for combating tuberculosis. The speakers have presented their data and provided control strategies against tuberculosis and pulmonary disease due to M. avium complex (MAC) from aspects of molecular epidemiology, pathogenesis, serodiagnosis, new anti-TB drugs, and vaccine development. Drs. Maeda and Murase have reported that the 12-locus VNTR analysis is very useful for molecular epidemiology of M. tuberculosis strains isolated in Japan better than IS6110-RFLP and suggested that the analysis is powerful tool for the molecular epidemiology. Drs. Matsumoto and Kobayashi have discovered a protein, mycobacterial DNA-binding protein 1 (MDPl), overproduced in dormant M. tuberculosis that plays key roles in latent/ persistent infection, disease progression, and host protection. They have concluded that MDP1 may be a possible target for anti-tuberculosis drugs and vaccines. Drs. Kitada and Maekura have developed serodiagnosis of MAC disease based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) by detecting anti-glycopeptidolipid (GPL) antibody in sera of human patients. GPL is specific for MAC. The EIA is a simple, rapid and accurate measure with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels of antibody also reflect disease activity. A large-scale clinical multicenter study is currently in progress. Dr. Makoto Matsumoto has discovered an innovative new anti-TB drug, OPC-67683 that is a derivative of nitroimidazole compounds. OPC-67683 inhibited mycolic acid synthesis and exerted potent antimycobacterial activity, including multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis. Multidrug therapy using OPC-67683 could also shorten the course of chemotherapy. The drug is clearly the most promising new anti-TB agent that has been identified in many years. Dr. Okada has presented the vaccine candidates for TB, such as HVJ-liposome/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA and HVJ-envelope/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA. The candidates exhibited an excellent protective efficacy in mice compared to current BCG vaccine, and improved histopathologic lesions induced by M. tuberculosis infection. The candidates also exerted the therapeutic effect in mice against both drugsusceptible TB and extensively drug-resistant TB. Using the cynomolgus monkey model (similar to human TB), HVJ-liposome/ HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA provided higher protective efficacy than BCG assessed by mortality. The combination of BCG and HVJ-liposome/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA by the prime-booster procedure could lead to a synergistic effect of 100\% survival in infected monkeys. These data suggest that the novel DNA vaccine is a possible candidate for human clinical trials. This symposium has highlighted new advances in our understanding of molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of "Mycobacteriology" and development of new serodiagnostics, anti-TB drugs, and vaccines. 1. The establishment of the quick genotyping method for TB in Japan using the variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR): Shinji MAEDA, Yoshiro MURASE (Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association) The 12-locus VNTR analysis that we have established optimally for Mycobacteriun tuberculosis in Japan was superior to the proposed 15-locus VNTR method in European countries. The discriminatory power of our system was also higher than that of IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In future, we will investigate the stability of copy number in each locus by using the strains that suspected epidemiological links in contact investigations. 2. A virulence factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which contributes to persistent infection, reactivation, and host protection: Sohkichi MATSUMOTO (Department of Host Defense, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine), Kazuo KOBAYASHI (Department of Immunology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases) Majority of adult tuberculosis is caused by reactivation of previously implanted Mycobacterium tuberculosis. During latent infection, some bacilli are in dormant state, which confers some survival advantage to not only bacteria but also the host. We presented that a protein overproduced in dormant M. tuberculosis plays key roles in persistent infection, disease progression, and host protection. We also presented utility of this protein, such as development of anti-tuberculosis drug and vaccine. 3. Serodiagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease by enzyme immunoassay using glycopeptidolipid antigen: Seigo KITADA, Ryoji MAEKURA (Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization National Toneyama Hospital) The diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) and/or its discrimination from pulmonary tuberculosis is sometimes complicated and time consuming. We have developed serological test by enzyme immunoassay that detect serum antibody to glycopeptidolipid antigen. The serodiagnosis is useful for the rapid diagnosis of MAC-PD and differential diagnosis from pulmonary TB. The antibody levels reflected the disease activity including radiographic severity. 4. A novel antituberculous agent, OPC-67683: Research and development: Makoto MATSUMOTO (Microbiological Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) We initiated a program to screen new antituberculous agents that have potential to shorten the total duration of treatment, provide improved efficacy against MDR-TB, be useful in treating HIV co-infected patients, and target latent TB infections. Our efforts led to the discovery of OPC-67683, a novel oxazo-imidazole derivative with a distinctive characteristic as a subclass mycolic acid inhibitor. Our evaluation studies confirmed OPC-67683 to possess potent in vitro and in vivo antituberculous activity, suggesting potential usefulness in alleviating the current TB problems. 5. The development of novel vaccines against M. tuberculosis: Masaji OKADA (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center) We have developed a novel tuberculosis (TB) vaccine (HVJ-liposome/ or HVJ-envelope/HSP65 DNA+ IL-12 DNA). The vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse compared to BCG vaccine, and improved the histopathological tuberculosis lesions. This vaccine also exerted therapeutic effect in vivo against XDR-TB as well as drug-sensitive TB in mice. Furthermore, by using the cynomolgus monkey (similar to human tuberculosis), this novel vaccine provided higher protective efficacy (mortality) than BCG mortality. Furthermore, the combination of HSP65+IL-12/HVJ and BCG by the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkey (100\% survival). These data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful against TB for human clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly around the world, largely because persons infected with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) traveled on aircraft to distant cities. Although many infected persons traveled on commercial aircraft, the risk, if any, of in-flight transmission is unknown.We attempted to interview passengers and crew members at least 10 days after they had taken one of three flights that transported a patient or patients with SARS. All index patients met the criteria of the World Health Organization for a probable case of SARS, and index or secondary cases were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serologic testing.After one flight carrying a symptomatic person and 119 other persons, laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 16 persons, 2 others were given diagnoses of probable SARS, and 4 were reported to have SARS but could not be interviewed. Among the 22 persons with illness, the mean time from the flight to the onset of symptoms was four days (range, two to eight), and there were no recognized exposures to patients with SARS before or after the flight. Illness in passengers was related to the physical proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 persons who were seated in the three rows in front of the index patient, as compared with 10 of the 88 persons who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS.Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.},

A study of the distribution of 2205 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis seen in Ibadan City, Nigeria over a 15-year period shows that the incidence of polio is much higher in the central core area of the city where sanitary conditions are poor, whereas in the peripheral parts of the city, where environmental sanitation is better, the incidence of polio is lower. A total of 88.4\% of the cases originated from the central core area whereas only 11.6\% were from the peripheral area. The polio victims from the peripheral area were, however, disproportionately older than the victims from the core area. It is suggested that in the central core area of Ibadan, where children with the highest risk of polio paralysis reside, immunization against polio should be started much earlier, preferably at birth, while children in the peripheral area who may receive their immunization at a later age (6 months and above) will require booster doses at age 15-18 months and at 5 years of age.},

Following acute HBV infection, 1-5\% of infected healthy adults and up to 90\% of infected infants become chronic carriers and have an increased risk of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the reduction in acute hepatitis B incidence and the universal vaccination programme in preadolescents in Catalonia (Spain), taking population changes into account, and to construct a model to forecast the future incidence of cases that permits the best preventive strategy to be adopted.Reported acute hepatitis B incidence in Catalonia according to age, gender, vaccination coverage, percentage of immigrants and the year of report of cases was analysed. A statistical analysis was made using three models: generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson or negative binomial distribution and a generalized additive model (GAM).The higher the vaccination coverage, the lower the reported incidence of hepatitis B (p <0.01). In groups with vaccination coverage > 70\%, the reduction in incidence was 2-fold higher than in groups with a coverage <70\% (p <0.01). The increase in incidence was significantly-higher in groups with a high percentage of immigrants and more than 15\% (p <0.01) in immigrant males of working age (19-49 years).The results of the adjusted models in this study confirm that the global incidence of hepatitis B has declined in Catalonia after the introduction of the universal preadolescent vaccination programme, but the incidence increased in male immigrants of working age. Given the potential severity of hepatitis B for the health of individuals and for the community, universal vaccination programmes should continue and programmes in risk groups, especially immigrants, should be strengthened.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug-resistant tuberculosis threatens efforts to control the disease. This report describes the prevalence of resistance to four first-line drugs in 35 countries participating in the World Health Organization-International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance between 1994 and 1997.The data are from cross-sectional surveys and surveillance reports. Participating countries followed guidelines to ensure the use of representative samples, accurate histories of treatment, standardized laboratory methods, and common definitions. A network of reference laboratories provided quality assurance. The median number of patients studied in each country or region was 555 (range, 59 to 14,344).Among patients with no prior treatment, a median of 9.9 percent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were resistant to at least one drug (range, 2 to 41 percent); resistance to isoniazid (7.3 percent) or streptomycin (6.5 percent) was more common than resistance to rifampin (1.8 percent) or ethambutol (1.0 percent). The prevalence of primary multidrug resistance was 1.4 percent (range, 0 to 14.4 percent). Among patients with histories of treatment for one month or more [corrected], the prevalence of resistance to any of the four drugs was 36.0 percent (range, 5.3 to 100 percent), and the prevalence of multidrug resistance was 13 percent (range, 0 to 54 percent). The overall prevalences were 12.6 percent for resistance to any of the four drugs [corrected] (range, 2.3 to 42.4 percent) and 2.2 percent for multidrug resistance (range, 0 to 22.1 percent). Particularly high prevalences of multidrug resistance were found in the former Soviet Union, Asia, the Dominican Republic, and Argentina.Resistance to antituberculosis drugs was found in all 35 countries and regions surveyed, suggesting that it is a global problem.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of the study was to optimize and characterize high therapeutic payload large respirable powders prepared by spray-drying technique for maximum fine particle fraction with minimum quantities of excipients. Influence of formulation components was optimized by a three-factor, five-level central composite design having different proportions of L-leucine (X1), tobramycin sulfate (X2), and poloxamer-188 (X3) as the independent variables and fine particle fraction as a response variable (Y). Large respirable powders were characterized for particle size, size distribution, moisture, crystallinity, and morphology. In vitro aerosol performance of powders was determined by an eight-stage Andersen cascade impactor using the Rotahaler. Mathematical model elucidated for Y was Y = 56.2068 + 5.7481 X1 - 3.0531 X2 + 0.8468 X3 + 1.1737 X1 X2 - 0.5012 X1 X3 - 0.7412 X2 X3 - 0.7149 X1(2) - 1.9212 X2(2) - 1.6187X3(2). The component of greatest influence on product performance (response variable) was found to be L-leucine. Lack of fit was not significant (p = 0.08), and regression equation predicted response for Y was in reasonably good agreement with experimental values (p = 0.01; R2 = 0.92). The optimal model predicted with a fine particle fraction of 62.8 +/- 2.6\% with X1, X2, X3 levels of 20, 45.71, and 5.51 respectively. Large respirable powders with TB load of 45.7\% w/w were prepared; they had smooth surface texture, dimpled spherical shape, roundness value close to 1(1.048 +/- 0.032) and were found to possess bulk tap densities of 0.04 g/cc, geometric particle sizes of 6-7 micro m, and emitted dose of 92\%. The results of the studies suggest that in vitro aerosol performance was affected significantly by small and deliberate change of specific formulation components and its proportions. It may be concluded that appropriate type and proportion of excipients is necessary to obtain maximum fine particle fraction of large respirable powders containing high therapeutic payloads.},

The Wells-Riley model was applied to predict transmission rates.The results suggested that poor ventilation and well-mixed air led to equal exposure of staff members to airborne TB bacilli. The model's prediction of attack rate (42\%) supported the actual number of infections that occurred (50\%).This study supports the use of environmental assessment and modelling as a tool for public health practitioners to determine the extent of TB exposure and to inform TB screening strategies. CO(2) and airborne particle profiles, both measured via a handheld device, provide the greatest practicality and amount of information that public health practitioners can use. Further studies will validate the level of screening required related to these measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Thermal hysteresis may be used to quantify and characterize the amount of heat stress an animal experiences. Heat stress studies of farm animals suggest that above a certain threshold body temperature (Tb) is driven by ambient temperature (Ta). Patterns in the Tb-Ta phase diagram indicate the presence of hysteresis. When hysteresis is present, there are two values for Tb depending on whether Ta is increasing or decreasing. A theoretical delay-relay model is proposed to illustrate the hysteretic dynamics of the Tb-Ta relationship when Ta is cyclic. Two types of hysteresis, transitional and thermal, are identified. Thermal hysteresis becomes prominent when Ta forces Tb into an elliptical limit cycle. The area of the ellipse is an indication of the animal's heat load. Also, the resulting Tb-Ta pattern depends on the delay (or lag) between Tb and Ta. The delay suggests possible levels of heat stress. A greater delay between Tb and Ta indicates more time is needed to dissipate the heat load, implying the animal is suffering more heat stress. For a given Ta, the Tb on the decreasing (recovery) path is always higher than the Tb on the increasing (challenge) path. Essentially, the animal requires more energy to dissipate heat than to absorb it.},

Among 1375 persons under 35 years of age who initiated LTBI treatment, failure to complete was associated with birth in Haiti (OR=2.17, CI(95\%) 1.49-3.17) or the Dominican Republic (OR=1.93, CI(95\%) 1.08-3.43).These results suggest that country-specific cultural and behavioral factors may contribute to failure to complete LTBI treatment, and that interventions to increase completion should focus on the first month after initiation.},

  Abstract                 = {The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa has increased over the past decade and a significant rise in these isolates in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been observed. However, the impact of MDR on VAP outcome has not been analysed in depth. We investigated the risk factors for early and crude mortality in a retrospective study of microbiologically and clinically documented VAP. Ninety-one VAP episodes in 83 patients were included, 31 caused by susceptible P. aeruginosa and 60 by MDR strains, of which 42 (70 \%) were extensively drug-resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa. Thirteen episodes concomitantly presented P. aeruginosa bacteraemia, in seven of which the origin was the respiratory tract. Whereas susceptible P. aeruginosa episodes were more likely than MDR episodes to receive adequate empirical (68 \% vs. 30 \%; p < 0.001) and definitive antimicrobial therapy (96 \% vs. 50 \%; p < 0.001), susceptible P. aeruginosa VAP presented a trend towards early mortality (29 \% vs. 15 \%; p = 0.06). A logistic regression model with early mortality as the dependent variable identified multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [odds ratio (OR) 10.4; 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-63.5; p = 0.01] and inadequate antibiotic therapy (OR 4.27; 95 \% CI 0.98-18.4; p = 0.052) as independent risk factors for early mortality. A similar analysis identified MODS (OR 4.31; 95 \% CI 1.14-16.2; p = 0.03) as the only independent predictor of crude mortality. The severity of acute illness clinical presentation was the main predictor of mortality. Despite adequate antibiotic therapy, susceptible P. aeruginosa seems to cause major early mortality. Although adequate therapy is essential to treat VAP, the severity of acute illness is a more important factor than drug resistance.},

  Abstract                 = {Several studies have suggested that resistance determinants usually reduce virulence. However, their contribution to decrease bloodstream infections is unclear. Our aim was to identify risk factors of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) bacteremia and to assess the prevalence of XDR-PA bacteremia. A retrospective study of PA bloodstream infections in our patient population with at least one clinical sample isolate due to PA (2006-2007) was carried out. A total of 2,131 patients with PA clinical samples were detected. Among 1,657 patients with susceptible-PA isolates, 95 developed PA-susceptible bacteremia. Concomitantly, among 474 patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR)-PA isolates, 265 with XDR-PA, and 209 with non-XDR MDR-PA, 43 developed XDR-PA bacteremia and 13 non-XDR MDR-PA bacteremia, respectively. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed the clonal nature of the two predominant XDR-PA phenotypes and genetic heterogeneity in non-XDR MDR-PA phenotypes. The proportion of XDR-PA bacteremia was higher than the proportion of bacteremia in the susceptible-PA population (16 \% vs. 6 \%; p < 0.001). A logistic regression model identified prior exposure to fluoroquinolones [odds ratio (OR) 2.80; 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 7.70] as the independent variable associated with XDR-PA bacteremia. Our study suggests that XDR-PA strains have a greater ability to develop bacteremia. It remains unclear as to whether this invasive capacity depends on clonal traits or on other virulence determinants.},

  Abstract                 = {The development and transmission of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) constitutes a serious threat to the effective control of TB in several countries. Here, in an attempt to further elucidate the dynamics of the acquisition of resistance to second-line drugs and investigate an eventual role for eis promoter mutations in aminoglycoside resistance, we have studied a set of multidrug-resistant (MDR)/XDR-TB isolates circulating in Lisbon, Portugal.Forty-four MDR-TB or XDR-TB isolates were genotyped and screened for mutations in genes associated with second-line drug resistance, namely tlyA, gyrA, rrs and eis.The most prevalent mutations found in each gene were Ins755GT in tlyA, A1401G in rrs, G-10A in eis and S91P in gyrA. Additionally, two genetic clusters were found in this study: Lisboa3 and Q1. The characteristic mutational profile found among recent XDR-TB circulating in Lisbon was also found in MDR-TB strains isolated in the 1990s. Also investigated was the resistance level conferred by eis G-10A mutations, revealing that eis G-10A mutations may result in amikacin resistance undetectable by widely used phenotypic assays.The analysis of the distribution of the mutations found by genetic clustering showed that in the Q1 cluster, two mutations, gyrA D94A and rrs A1401G, were enough to ensure development of XDR-TB from an MDR strain. Moreover, in the Lisboa3 cluster it was possible to elaborate a model in which the development of low-level kanamycin resistance was at the origin of the emergence of XDR-TB strains that can be discriminated by tlyA mutations.},

The most urgent clinical need is to discover potent agents capable of reducing the duration of MDR and XDR tuberculosis therapy with a success rate comparable to that of current therapies for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. The last decade has seen the discovery of new agent classes for the management of tuberculosis, several of which are currently in clinical trials. However, given the high attrition rate of drug candidates during clinical development and the emergence of drug resistance, the discovery of additional clinical candidates is clearly needed. Here, we report on a promising class of imidazopyridine amide (IPA) compounds that block Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth by targeting the respiratory cytochrome bc1 complex. The optimized IPA compound Q203 inhibited the growth of MDR and XDR M. tuberculosis clinical isolates in culture broth medium in the low nanomolar range and was efficacious in a mouse model of tuberculosis at a dose less than 1 mg per kg body weight, which highlights the potency of this compound. In addition, Q203 displays pharmacokinetic and safety profiles compatible with once-daily dosing. Together, our data indicate that Q203 is a promising new clinical candidate for the treatment of tuberculosis.},

The anthraniloyl chromophore excited at 330 nm sensitizes the long lived luminescence of enzyme bound Tb(III) at 490, 545, 585 and 620 nm. Assuming a mechanism of radiationless energy transfer, the actual distance of separation between the donor anthraniloyl moiety and the acceptor Tb(III) was calculated to be R = 10 angstroms. The binding studies support the earlier observation of Bone et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 (1992) 10031-10035) that the substrate and the lanthanide Gd(III) interact with a common binding domain of the protein. The catalytic activity of the monophosphatase is completely dependent upon Mg(II) ions which elicit changes in the secondary structure of the protein as revealed by circular dichroism measurements. Binding of Mg(II) ions tend to stabilize the secondary structure of the phosphatase against guanidinium-HCl denaturation.},

Addition of glycerol produces a progressive enhancement of the fluorescence yield to a limiting value at about 70\% v/v glycerol. Glycerol enhancement of fluorescence is also observed for monomeric Trp, and a good correlation exists between this effect and literature estimates of the fractional degree of Trp exposure in nine globular proteins. The estimate of fractional Trp exposure in bacteriorhodopsin from this correlation (50 +/- 15\%) is in agreement with the value obtained by spectral differentiation and also by modified Stern-Volmer curves for quenching by water-soluble acrylamide. The absence of significant quenching by Tb(III) or Eu(III) ions, which may be expected to bind to the purple membrane surface, shows that the exposed Trp residues are in contact with water in intraprotein regions of the membrane and may be the first direct evidence for a transmembrane aqueous channel by which protons are actively transported during the bacteriorhodopsin photochemical cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {The prevalence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), defined as TB that is resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides, is rising worldwide. The extent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to fluoroquinolones depends on the mutation in the DNA gyrase, the only target of fluoroquinolones. The MIC of moxifloxacin, the most active fluoroquinolone against M. tuberculosis, may be lower than its peak serum level for some ofloxacin-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, if the MIC of moxifloxacin is lower than its peak serum level, it may be effective against XDR-TB. Our objective was to determine the efficacy of moxifloxacin in treating ofloxacin-resistant TB. We selected isogenic fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in vivo. We infected Swiss mice with either wild-type H37Rv or one of three mutant strains with different MICs that are commonly seen in clinical practice. The MICs of the mutant strains ranged from below to above the peak moxifloxacin level seen in humans (3 μg/ml). Each mouse was treated with one of four moxifloxacin doses for 1 month. Moxifloxacin was effective against mutant strain GyrB D500N, with the lowest MIC (0.5 μg/ml), when the standard dose was doubled. Moxifloxacin reduced mortality in mice infected with mutant strain GyrA A90V with an intermediate MIC (2 μg/ml). However, it had no impact on the mutant strain GyrA D94G with the highest MIC (4 μg/ml). Our study underscores current WHO recommendations to use moxifloxacin when there is resistance to early-generation fluoroquinolones such as ofloxacin, restricting this recommendation to strains with moxifloxacin MICs of less than or equal to 2 μg/ml.},

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides a potential tool for non-invasive evaluation of the trabecular bone structure. The objective of this study was to determine the reproducibility of the NMR relaxation parameters (T(2), Carr-Purcel-T(2), T(1ρ)) for fat and water and relate those to the structural parameters obtained by micro-computed tomography (μCT). Especially, we aimed to evaluate the effect of freezing on the relaxation parameters. For storing bone samples, freezing is the standard procedure during which the biochemical and cellular organization of the bone marrow may be affected. Bovine trabecular bone samples were stored at -20 °C for 7 days and measured by NMR spectroscopy before and after freezing. The reproducibility of NMR relaxation parameters, as expressed by the coefficient of variation, ranged from 3.1\% to 27.9\%. In fresh samples, some correlations between NMR and structural parameters (Tb.N, Tb.Sp) were significant (e.g. the relaxation rate for T(2) of fat versus Tb.Sp: r = -0.716, p < 0.01). Freezing did not significantly change the NMR relaxation times but the correlations between relaxation parameters and the μCT structural parameters were not statistically significant after freezing, suggesting some nonsystematic alterations of the marrow structure. Therefore, the use of frozen bone samples for NMR relaxation studies may provide inferior information about the trabecular bone structure.},

  Abstract                 = {The degree of polymerisation (DP) of modern resin cements has a significant role to play in determining the ultimate physical and mechanical properties of the material. This study was undertaken to determine the DP of three adhesive resin cements, viz. 3M Opal Cement (3M), Enforce (E, Caulk/Dentsply) and C epsilon tB-Metabond (CB, Parkell). Spectra of both light-cured (3M and E) and self-cured (3M, E and CB) samples were obtained at different time intervals from 3 minutes after mixing the cement up to 24 hours, using a Dilor Raman Confocal Microprobe. The DP of the different cement specimens was calculated from the spectra and statistically analysed (ANOVA). There was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) between the DP of 3M and E in the two different activation modes. The light-cured specimens attained a statistically higher degree of polymerisation. CB obtained a statistically significant higher degree of polymerisation (P < 0.01) compared with 3M and E at 24 hours.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study provides an extension of the previously developed concept of purity-activity relationships (PARs) and enables the quantitative evaluation of the effects of multiple minor components on the bioactivity of residually complex natural products. The anti-tuberculosis active triterpenes from the Alaskan ethnobotanical Oplopanax horridus were selected as a case for the development of the quantitative PAR (QPAR) concept. The residual complexity of the purified triterpenes was initially evaluated by 1D- and 2D-NMR and identified as a combination of structurally related and unrelated impurities. Using a biochemometric approach, the qHNMR purity and anti-TB activity of successive chromatographic fractions of O. horridus triterpenes were correlated by linear regression analysis to generate a mathematical QPAR model. The results demonstrate that impurities, such as widely occurring monoglycerides, can have a profound impact on the observed antimycobacterial activity of triterpene-enriched fractions. The QPAR concept is shown to be capable of providing a quantitative assessment in situations where residually complex constitution contributes toward the biological activity of natural products.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis is still one of the most important causes of death worldwide. The 2010 Lancet tuberculosis series provided a comprehensive overview of global control efforts and challenges. In this update we review recent progress. With improved control efforts, the world and most regions are on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of decreasing tuberculosis incidence by 2015, and the Stop TB Partnership target of halving 1990 mortality rates by 2015; the exception is Africa. Despite these advances, full scale-up of tuberculosis and HIV collaborative activities remains challenging and emerging drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major threat. Recognition of the effect that non-communicable diseases--such as smoking-related lung disease, diet-related diabetes mellitus, and alcohol and drug misuse--have on individual vulnerability, as well as the contribution of poor living conditions to community vulnerability, shows the need for multidisciplinary approaches. Several new diagnostic tests are being introduced in endemic countries and for the first time in 40 years a coordinated portfolio of promising new tuberculosis drugs exists. However, none of these advances offer easy solutions. Achievement of international tuberculosis control targets and maintenance of these gains needs optimum national health policies and services, with ongoing investment into new approaches and strategies. Despite growing funding in recent years, a serious shortfall persists. International and national financial uncertainty places gains at serious risk. Perseverance and renewed commitment are needed to achieve global control of tuberculosis, and ultimately, its elimination.},

In addition to routine polio immunization included in the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI), two major activities were planned: mass polio vaccination campaigns and surveillance of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis. In 2000, the disease had been eliminated from most countries in the world. However, as of 2002, the community acceptance of vaccination was endangered in some countries by rumors about assumed adverse effects of oral polio vaccine. The rejection of polio immunization provided a worrying resurgence of polio in Northern Nigeria, followed by re-infection of 21 countries, whereas resurgence of the disease also was observed in Northern India. Supplementary vaccination activities were resumed, additional resources were mobilized and, in 2007, most re-infected countries became polio-free again. Today, polio remains endemic in only four countries. The goal of global polio eradication has now been set at 2010, but doubts have been expressed about the feasibility of its achievement.},

  Abstract                 = {7F0 ---- 5D0 excitation spectroscopy of Eu(III) has shown that human Factor Xa has two high affinity lanthanide ion-binding sites. The deuterium isotope effect on the reciprocal lifetime (tau-1) of excited Eu(III) in human Factor Xa has indicated that 2 to 3 water molecules remain on Eu(III) after being complexed by Factor Xa, suggesting that 3-6 ligand atoms are provided by the protein, probably through two or three gamma-carboxyglutamic acids (GLA). F orster -type interlanthanide energy transfer has been utilized to measure the distance between the high affinity metal ion-binding sites of human Factor Xa using Tb(III) as an energy donor and Nd(III), Ho(III), or Er(III) as energy acceptors. Tau-1 values of Tb(III) in the presence of the acceptor ions Nd(III), Ho(III), and Er(III) were 1.90, 1.66, and 1.76 ms-1, respectively, which compared to 1.31 ms-1 in the presence of the nonacceptor ion Gd(III), yield energy transfer efficiencies of 0.29, 0.20, and 0.24, respectively. From these efficiencies and published critical distances (R0) ( Horrocks , W. DeW ., Jr., Rhee , M-J., Snyder, A. P., and Sudnick , D. R. (1980) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 102, 3650-3652), the distance between two high affinity sites is estimated to be 10.7 A. Based on these data, we propose that the two high affinity sites of human Factor Xa consist of two paired GLA residues; GLA-19, GLA-20 and GLA-25, GLA-26 together with one of the remaining single GLA residues for each site.},

The epidemic was notable because of its explosive nature and its occurrence in a school where 97\% of the children had been vaccinated. Many had been vaccinated at less than one year of age. The index case was a girl in second grade who produced 28 secondary cases in 14 different classrooms. Organisms recirculated by the ventilating system were strongly implicated. After two subsequent generations, 60 children had been infected, and the epidemic subsided. From estimates of major physical and biologic factors, it was possible to calculate that the index case produced approximately 93 units of airborne infection (quanta) per minute. The epidemic pattern suggested that the secondaries were less infectious by an order of magnitude. The exceptional infectiousness of the index case, inadequate immunization of many of the children, and the high percentage of air recirculated throughout the school, are believed to account for the extent and sharpness of the outbreak.},

At the end of the last century Cornet presented evidence that tuberculosis was dust-borne, and Flügge presented equally convincing evidence that tuberculosis was droplet-borne. Chapin, in 1910, summarized evidence against the prevaling belief in airborne transmission of many common infections but made an exception of tuberculosis. Chapin emphasized transmission by direct contact (touching). In the 1930's William F. Wells introduced the droplet nucleus hypothesis. In the 1950's droplet nuclei were shown to be the carriers of infection from tuberculosis patients to guinea pigs breathing air vented from the patients' ward. Subsequent evidence has indicated that direct contact is unimportant, although close proximity facilitates airborne transmission. Attempts to control the spread of tuberculosis by air disinfection or by immunization have been disappointing. Specific antituberculosis drugs, widely used since the 1950's, cause patients to become noninfectious for others very rapidly, even before organisms in the sputum disappear. Chemotherapy is now recognized as the corner stone of contagion control.},

In the present paper the relationships are analysed further. It is found that a general QSAR equation, covering a diverse range of structures, correlates the biological activity reported by Muller and Greff with a single physicochemical parameter, TB'. The parameter TB' is the boiling point at atmospheric pressure (TB), adjusted for compounds with Trouton constants different from 22 cal deg-1 mol-1: TB' = (Tr X TB/22) + 40(1 - Tr/22) where Tr is the Trouton constant. Some of the compounds studied were found to be more irritant than predicted by the general equation: their enhanced activity can be rationalised in terms of their chemical reactivity as electrophiles, their metabolism to electrophiles, or their hydrolysis to more irritant products.},

  Abstract                 = {A great challenge is posed to the treatment of tuberculosis due to the evolution of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drugresistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in recent times. The complex cell envelope of the bacterium contains unusual structures of lipids which protects the bacterium from host enzymes and escape immune response. To overcome the drug resistance, targeting "drug targets" which have a critical role in growth and virulence factor is a novel approach for better tuberculosis treatment. The enzyme Phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PptT) is an attractive drug target as it is primarily involved in post translational modification of various types-I polyketide synthases and assembly of mycobactin, which is required for lipid virulence factors. Our in silico studies reported that the structural model of M.tuberculosis PptT characterizes the structure-function activity. The refinement of the model was carried out with molecular dynamics simulations and was analyzed with root mean square deviation (RMSD), and radius of gyration (Rg). This confirmed the structural behavior of PptT in dynamic system. Molecular docking with substrate coenzyme A (CoA) identified the binding pocket and key residues His93, Asp114 and Arg169 involved in PptT-CoA binding. In conclusion, our results show that the M.tuberculosis PptT model and critical CoA binding pocket initiate the inhibitor design of PptT towards tuberculosis treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of socioeconomic level and dentifrice brand on the brushing habits and the fluoride ingestion. The sample was composed of 124 Brazilian children aged 3-9 years, from different socioeconomic levels (SEL). It was used a crossover study with the children using two dentifrice brands: Tandy Uva/T (1,100 ppm NaF) and Super Branco/SB (1,500 ppm MFP). Each child brushed his/her teeth with both dentifrice brands with weekly intervals between the brushes. The oral hygiene habits considered in this study were the Dentifrice Amount Placed on toothbrush (ADP), Dentifrice Amount Ingested (ADI), Fluoride Amount Ingested (FAI) and Brushing Time (TB). The data obtained were submitted to ANOVA test. It was observed that there was influence of SEL on the ADP and TB. The high SEL children showed a higher ADP and TB. The dentifrice brand influenced significantly the ADP, ADI, AFI and TB; the dentifrice T showed a higher ADP, ADI, but a lower AFI and TB. The results showed a significant interaction between SEL and dentifrice brand as ADI, AFI and TB. Although the children ingested a higher amount of T dentifrice they ingested a higher amount of fluoride from the SB dentifrice.},

At the end of the study, RMP and INH were given for 4 months. The rates of elimination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were compared in the regimens using non-linear mixed effects modelling of the serial sputum colony counts (SSCC) during the first 8 weeks.After adjustment for covariates, MFX substitution appeared superior during the early phase of a bi-exponential fall in colony counts, but significant and similar acceleration of bacillary elimination during the late phase occurred with both GFX and MFX (P = 0.002). Substitution of OFX had no effect. These findings were supported by estimates of time to conversion, using Cox regression, but there were no significant differences in proportions culture-negative at 8 weeks.GFX and MFX improve the sterilising activity of regimens and might shorten treatment; their progression into Phase III trials therefore seems warranted.},

In recent years, various organisations have assessed research needs and proposed priorities for tuberculosis.

The top priority areas were drug development (28 articles), diagnosis and diagnostic tests (27), epidemiology (20), health services research (16), basic research (13), and vaccine development and use (13). The most focused questions were on the treatment and prevention of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in people co-infected with HIV. Methods used to identify these priorities were varied. Improvements can be made to ensure the process is more rigorous and transparent, and to use existing research or systematic reviews more often. WHO, Stop TB Partnership, and other organisations could adopt an incremental process of priority development, building on the existing knowledge base.},

  Abstract                 = {Since its first mass use in 1960, oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) has largely eliminated paralytic poliomyelitis from temperate-climate and subtropical regions of the world that have good health services and a combined total population of almost 2,000 million people. The various strategies used in these countries have been highly successful even where, as in the USA, large numbers of children received no vaccine or only a single dose of OPV . During the period of 1981-1982, only 2.8 cases per 100 million total population per year were reported in the USA. The main challenge in the present era is the economically undeveloped tropical and subtropical regions with inadequate health services that are inhabited by more than half of the world population, where recent surveys for residual paralysis due to poliomyelitis have shown that the incidence of the disease has been higher than it was in the USA and other predominantly temperate-climate countries before the vaccine era. The problem in these countries is that the majority of children receive no vaccine and that the extensive year-round dissemination of virulent polioviruses requires a different strategy of vaccination from that used in the temperate-climate countries. The special point about the annual mass vaccinations with OPV for all children younger than three, four, or five years of age-which have proven highly successful in Cuba (for the past 20 years), in Brazil (during the past three years), and recently also in Mexico-is that all the children are usually vaccinated within one or two days, which quickly breaks the chain of transmission of the virulent viruses, and the annual campaigns create and maintain the maximum number of children with resistant intestinal tracts.},

The procedures by which oral polio vaccine (OPV) rapidly eliminated all or almost all paralytic disease caused by polioviruses from the economically developed temperate climate countries have been inadequate in tropical and subtropical countries, except in some small countries with good health services, largely because there is much more year-round circulation of "wild" polioviruses which continue to produce the disease in the unvaccinated and incompletely vaccinated children. Not even a cheap, hypothetically 100 percent effective, one-dose vaccine could eliminate poliomyelitis in the tropics if, for a variety of reasons, it would reach only a portion of the infant population. Paralytic disease caused by polioviruses has been quickly eliminated from both small and large tropical countries by OPV in well-organized programs of annual mass vaccinations of almost all children under a certain age.},

  Abstract                 = {Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and their signaling pathways play key roles in protection from and pathogenesis of mycobacterial infection, and their balance and dynamic changes may control or predict clinical outcome. Peripheral blood cells' capacity to produce proinflammatory (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin-12/23p40 [IL-12/23p40], and gamma interferon [IFN-gamma]) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or unrelated stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, phytohemagglutinin) was studied in 93 pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients and 127 healthy controls from Indonesia. Their cells' ability to respond to IFN-gamma was examined to investigate whether M. tuberculosis infection can also inhibit IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR) signaling. Although there was interindividual variability in the observed responses, the overall results revealed that M. tuberculosis-induced TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels showed opposite trends. Whereas TNF-alpha production was higher in active-TB patients than in controls, IFN-gamma production was strongly depressed during active TB, correlated inversely with TB disease severity, and increased during therapy. By contrast, mitogen-induced IFN-gamma production, although lower in patients than in controls, did not change during treatment, suggesting an M. tuberculosis-specific and reversible component in the depression of IFN-gamma. Depressed IFN-gamma production was not due to decreased IL-12/IL-23 production. Importantly, IFN-gamma-inducible responses were also significantly depressed during active TB and normalized during treatment, revealing disease activity-related and reversible impairment in IFN-gammaR signaling in TB. Finally, IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratios significantly correlated with TB cure. Taken together, these results show that M. tuberculosis-specific stimulation of IFN-gamma (but not TNF-alpha) production and IFN-gammaR signaling are significantly depressed in active TB, correlate with TB disease severity and activity, and normalize during microbiological TB cure. The depression of both IFN-gamma production and IFN-gammaR signaling may synergize in contributing to defective host control in active TB.},

  Abstract                 = {Development of new, effective, and affordable tuberculosis (TB) therapies has been identified as a critical priority for global TB control. As new candidates emerge from the global TB drug pipeline, the potential impacts of novel, shorter regimens on TB incidence and mortality have not yet been examined.We used a mathematical model of TB to evaluate the expected benefits of shortening the duration of effective chemotherapy for active pulmonary TB. First, we considered general relationships between treatment duration and TB dynamics. Next, as a specific example, we calibrated the model to reflect the current situation in the South-East Asia region. We found that even with continued and rapid progress in scaling up the World Health Organization's DOTS strategy of directly observed, short-course chemotherapy, the benefits of reducing treatment duration would be substantial. Compared to a baseline of continuing DOTS coverage at current levels, and with currently available tools, a 2-mo regimen introduced by 2012 could prevent around 20\% (range 13\%-28\%) of new cases and 25\% (range 19\%-29\%) of TB deaths in South-East Asia between 2012 and 2030. If effective treatment with existing drugs expands rapidly, overall incremental benefits of shorter regimens would be lower, but would remain considerable (13\% [range 8\%-19\%] and 19\% [range 15\%-23\%] reductions in incidence and mortality, respectively, between 2012 and 2030). A ten-year delay in the introduction of new drugs would erase nearly three-fourths of the total expected benefits in this region through 2030.The introduction of new, shorter treatment regimens could dramatically accelerate the reductions in TB incidence and mortality that are expected under current regimens-with up to 2- or 3-fold increases in rates of decline if shorter regimens are accompanied by enhanced case detection. Continued progress in reducing the global TB burden will require a balanced approach to pursuing new technologies while promoting wider implementation of proven strategies.},

Increase in the incidences of life-threatening multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extreme drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis worsens the existing scenario and urge the need of new druggable targets and new drugs. Targeting Rv3802c, an essential cell wall lipase, can open up a new arsenal to fight the dreadful opportunistic pathogen. Our current study highlights the essentiality of Rv3802c. Its 3D structure is predicted for the first time which provides insight in identifying the ligand binding sites. Our analysis showed Rv3802c is highly conserved throughout mycobacterial species with no significant sequence homolog found in human proteome. Virtual screening followed by comparative docking studies of Rv3802c with its closest human structural homolog has been carried out to identify potential inhibitors effective towards mycobacterial proteins. Two diverse molecules from ZINC database, ZINC26726377 and ZINC43866786 have been identified as potential inhibitors effective towards Rv3802c based on the difference in predicted binding free energy of -3.99 and -3.28kcal/mol respectively. Rv3802c is a promising drug target and also a step towards understanding and targeting the pathogen's cell wall and lipid metabolism simultaneously to combat tuberculosis.},

Such data arise when individuals are only observed occasionally to determine which events have occurred. In such data, the (unknown) event times are interval censored. In addition, some individuals may have experienced some of the events before their first observation and may be lost to follow-up before experiencing the last event. Using a frailty model proposed by Aalen (1988, Mathematical Scientist 13, 90-103) but which has never been used to analyze real data, we examine whether individuals who develop early markers of HIV infection can also be expected to develop antibody and other indicators of HIV infection more rapidly.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the availability of highly effective therapy, tuberculosis (TB) remains a major problem in South Africa, even in urban centres such as Soweto which is relatively well provided with health services. We therefore assessed two aspects of TB management in Soweto: (i) the proportion of known tuberculous patients adequately treated; (ii) whether case finding through investigation of home contacts of notified patients was effective. In 1978 patients with TB were required to take chemotherapy for at least a year. Only 28\% of newly notified patients attended the clinics frequently enough and/or were hospitalized long enough to obtain 80\% or more of the treatment they required during that first year. A major part of this problem of non-compliance was infrequent attendance; these patients received therapy of an adequate duration, but at an inadequate dosage. At least 17\% of patients over 10 years of age had tubercle bacilli in their sputa on microscopy more than 4 months after therapy was started. About two-thirds of known home contacts were investigated by the health services in accordance with their stated policy, and 5\% of contacts were subsequently notified. Home-contact tracing therefore seems worthwhile.},

  abstract  = {On average a person spends 1.1 h per day traveling and devotes a predictable fraction of income to travel. We show that these time and money budgets are stable over space and time and can be used for projecting future levels of mobility and transport mode. The fixed travel money budget requires that mobility rises nearly in proportion with income. Covering greater distances within the same fixed travel time budget requires that travelers shift to faster modes of transport. The choice of future transport modes is also constrained by path dependence because transport infrastructures change only slowly. In addition, demand for low-speed public transport is partially determined by urban population densities and land-use characteristics. We present a model that incorporates these constraints, which we use for projecting traffic volume and the share of the major motorized modes of transportâ€”automobiles, buses, trains and high speed transport (mainly aircraft)â€”for 11 regions and the world through 2050. We project that by 2050 the average world citizen will travel as many kilometers as the average West European in 1990. The average American's mobility will rise by a factor of 2.6 by 2050, to 58,000 km/year. The average Indian travels 6000&#xa0;km/year by 2050, comparable with West European levels in the early 1970s. Today, world citizens move 23 billion km in total; by 2050 that figure grows to 105 billion.},

  Abstract                 = {The hypothesis was tested that slow-growing grass species perform a greater proportion of total plant NO3- reduction in their roots than do fast-growing grasses. Eight grass species were selected that differed in maximum relative growth rate (RGR) and net NO3- uptake rate (NNUR). Plants were grown with free access to nutrients in hydroponics under controlled-environment conditions. The site of in vivo NO3- reduction was assessed by combining in vivo NO3- reductase activity (NRA) assays with biomass allocation data, and by analysing the NO3- to amino acid ratio of xylem sap. In vivo NRA of roots and shoots increased significantly with increasing NNUR and RGR. The proportion of total plant NO3- reduction that occurs in roots was found to be independent of RGR and NNUR, with the shoot being the predominant site of NO3- reduction in all species. The theoretical maximum proportion of whole plant nitrogen assimilation that could take place in the roots was calculated using information on root respiration rates, RGR, NNUR, and specific respiratory costs associated with growth, maintenance and ion uptake. The calculated maximum proportion that the roots can contribute to total plant NO3- reduction was 0.37 and 0.23 for the fast-growing Dactylis glomerata L. and the slow-growing Festuca ovina L., respectively. These results indicate that slow-growing grass species perform a similar proportion of total plant NO3- reduction in their roots to that exhibited by fast-growing grasses. Shoots appear to be the predominant site of whole plant NO3- reduction in both fast- and slow-growing grasses when plants are grown with free access to nutrients.},

With this network, we explore the potential spread of epidemics through a Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered (SLIR) disease model. We simulate an exact model of a stochastic SLIR Poisson process with disease parameters representing a typical influenza-like illness. We test vaccine distribution strategies under limited resources. We examine global and location-based distribution strategies, as a way to reach critical individuals in the rural setting.

We assessed the current strategy of radiographic screening of legal immigrants plus current tuberculosis-control programs alone and with the addition of either U.S.-funded expansion of the strategy of directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS), in Mexico or tuberculin skin testing to screen legal immigrants from Mexico. We also examined tuberculosis-related outcomes among migrants from Haiti and the Dominican Republic using the same three strategies.As compared with the current strategy, expanding the DOTS program in Mexico at a cost to the United States of 34.9 million dollars would result in 2591 fewer cases of tuberculosis in the United States, with 349 fewer deaths from the disease and net discounted savings of 108 million dollars over a 20-year period. Adding tuberculin skin testing to radiographic screening of legal immigrants from Mexico would result in 401 fewer cases of tuberculosis in the United States but would cost an additional 329 million dollars. Expansion of the DOTS program would remain cost saving even if the initial investment were doubled, if the United States paid for all antituberculosis drugs in Mexico, or if the decline in the incidence of tuberculosis in Mexico was less than projected. A 9.4 million dollars investment to expand the DOTS program in Haiti and the Dominican Republic would result in net U.S. savings of 20 million dollars over a 20-year period.U.S.-funded efforts to expand the DOTS program in Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic could reduce tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality among migrants to the United States, producing net cost savings for the United States.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: In July 2009, French public health authorities embarked in a mass vaccination campaign against A/H1N1 2009 pandemic-influenza. We explored the attitudes and behaviors of the general population toward pandemic vaccination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 2,253 French representative adults aged 18 to 64 from November 17 to 25, 2009 (completion rate: 93.8\%). The main outcome was the acceptability of A/H1N1 vaccination as defined by previous receipt or intention to get vaccinated ("Yes, certainly", "Yes, probably"). Overall 17.0\% (CI 95\%, 15.5\% to 18.7\%) of respondents accepted A/H1N1 vaccination. Independent factors associated with acceptability included: male sex (p = .0001); older age (p = .002); highest or lowest level of education (p = .016); non-clerical occupation (p = .011); having only one child (p = .008); and having received seasonal flu vaccination in prior 3 years (p<.0001). Acceptability was also significantly higher among pregnant women (37.9\%) and other at risk groups with chronic diseases (34.8\%) (p = .002). Only 35.5\% of respondents perceived A/H1N1 influenza illness as a severe disease and 12.7\% had experienced A/H1N1 cases in their close relationships with higher acceptability (p<.0001 and p = .006, respectively). In comparison to 26.0\% respondents who did not consult their primary care physician, acceptability was significantly higher among 8.0\% respondents who were formally advised to get vaccinated, and lower among 63.7\% respondents who were not advised to get vaccinated (respectively: 15.8\%, 59.5\% and 11.7\%- p<.0001). Among respondents who refused vaccination, 71.2\% expressed concerns about vaccine safety. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our survey occurred one week before the peak of the pandemic in France. We found that alarming public health messages aiming at increasing the perception of risk severity were counteracted by daily personal experience which did not confirm the threat, while vaccine safety was a major issue. This dissonance may have been amplified by having not involved primary care physicians in the mass vaccination campaign.},

Where treatment is available, it is lengthy, expensive, and associated with poor adherence and notable morbidity and mortality. Preventive treatment effectively lowers the risk of disease progression for contacts of individuals with drug-susceptible tuberculosis, but this strategy is poorly studied for contacts of people with MDR tuberculosis. In this Review we discuss the management of child contacts of source cases with MDR tuberculosis. We pay particular attention to assessment, existing international guidelines, possible preventive treatments, rationales for different management strategies, and the interaction with and implications of HIV infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Empirical field data describing daily and seasonal cycles in body temperature (Tb) of free-ranging Crocodylus porosus (32-1010 kg) can be predicted by a mathematical analysis. The analysis provides a mechanistic explanation for the decreased amplitude of daily cycles in Tb and the increase in 'average' Tb with increasing mass. Assessments of 'average' daily Tb were made by dividing the integral of the difference between measured values of Tb and minimum operative temperature by the period of integration, to yield a thermal index expressing relative 'warmth' of crocodiles. The average daily Tb of a 1010 kg crocodile was 3.7 degreesC warmer than that of a 42 kg individual in summer and 1.9 degreesC warmer than that of a 32 kg individual in winter. The success of this mathematical approach confirms that crocodiles are simple ectotherms and that there is unlikely to be a significant contribution to their thermal biology from physiological mechanisms. Behaviour, however, is very important even in large individuals. Crocodiles in the field typically move daily between land and water in cycles that vary seasonally. We predicted Tb for the reverse of these behavioural cycles, which more than doubled seasonal fluctuations in Tb compared with the observed fluctuations. We were also able to predict the Tb of very large, dinosaur-sized crocodiles in a similar climate to that at our study site. A 10 000 kg 'crocodile', for example, would be expected to have a Tb of 31 degreesC in winter, varying by less than 0.1 degreesC during a day when operative temperatures varied by nearly 20 degreesC, from 20 to 38 degreesC. The study confirms that, in low latitudes at least, large dinosaurs must have had an essentially high and stable value of Tb, without any need for endothermy. Also, access to shade or water must have been crucial for the survival of large dinosaurs at low latitudes. Furthermore, the finding of increasing 'average' Tb as ectotherms grow larger may have implications for the metabolic rates of very large reptiles, because the Q10 effect could counteract the downscaling of metabolic rate with mass, an effect that seems not to have been recognised previously.},

Using a modified algorithm which was previously developed for ZnO, we take only bulk absorption data from the literature and match the PSDs derived from QD absorbance spectra with those from transmission electron microscopical (TEM) image analysis in order to arrive at the functional dependence of the band gap on particle size. Additional samples sized solely from their absorbance spectra with our algorithm show excellent agreement with TEM results. We investigate the influence of parameters of the TEM image analysis such as threshold value on the final result. The band gap versus size relationship developed from analysis of just two samples lies well within the bounds of a number of published data sets. We believe that our methodology provides an attractive shortcut for the study of various novel quantum-confined direct band gap semiconductor systems as it permits the band gap energies of a broad size range of QDs to be probed with relatively few synthetic experiments and without quantum mechanical simulations.},

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a population pharmacokinetic model to characterize the inter- and intra-individual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters of RIF in Mexican patients.Ninety-four patients receiving antituberculosis therapy participated in this prospective study. Plasma concentration-time data were described using a one-compartment model with lag time, absorption and first-order elimination. The potential influence of demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, and the pharmaceutical formulation (A, B, C and D) on the pharmacokinetics parameters, was evaluated by non-linear mixed-effect modelling (nonmem). Seventy-seven additional patients participated in the validation of the model.The final population pharmacokinetic model obtained was as follows: apparent clearance CL/F = 8·17 L/h (1·40 as high for males), apparent distribution volume V(d)/F = 50·1 L (1·29 as high for males), absorption rate constant K(aA) = 0·391/h, K(aB,C,D) = 2·70/h, relative bioavailability F(A) = 0·468, F(B,C,D) = 1, lag time in the absorption phase T(lag) = 0·264 h. The final model improved the precision on the parameter estimates (CL/F, V(d) /F and K(a) by 31·9\%, 16·7\% and 92·9\%, respectively). The residual variability was 27·3\%.Gender was associated with changes in CL/F and V(d) /F whereas the pharmaceutical formulation was associated with changes in F and altered the K(a) . The validation data set showed that the model could be used in clinical practice for Bayesian dose adjustment of RIF in TB patients.},

  Abstract                 = {3-Dimensional coordinates of Golgi-impregnated neurons in left and right human areas TA, TB and TC were stored using computer microscopy. The tangential extent of neurons was taken to be an estimate of their effective radius, which is a compromise between their maximum radius and the average tangential projection of their dendrites. Analysis of variance and t-test comparisons were made among the areas and between the hemispheres on a total data base of 622 neurons. It was assumed that the neurons are organized in functional columns. The tangential extent of left-hemisphere columns is absolutely larger than on the right, but is smaller relative to the column-column interval. Neuropil on the left is packed more densely with dendrites belonging to the nearest column. It seems that during the course of evolution interconnected units (as in the right hemisphere) have become more disentangled (left hemisphere), yielding perhaps a greater capacity for differentiated responses in the latter case. A more detailed analysis revealed that much of the difference between areas and/or hemispheres was due to the pyramidal neurons. The structure of non-pyramidal cells is relatively consistent within each hemisphere and shows non-systematic differences between the hemispheres.},

To avoid misdiagnosis, therefore, the reliability characteristics of the test should be taken into account upon reasoning.In this paper, we address the issue of modelling the reliability characteristics of diagnostic tests in a probabilistic network.To this end, we study the mathematical foundation of a test's characteristics and collate them with the probabilities required for a probabilistic network.We show that the standard reliability characteristics that are generally available from the literature have to be further detailed and stratified, for example by experts, before they can be included in a network. We demonstrate these modelling issues by means of a real-life probabilistic network in oncology.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Vaccination against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 is an effective strategy to mitigate the spread of the disease. While the vaccine is now available, social acceptance remains relatively uncertain in many societies. The purpose of this study was to examine the beliefs, attitudes and practices associated with the intention to get vaccinated against the A/H1N1 virus among the general population in France. METHODS: A representative sample of 1001 individuals (stratified random recruitment procedure, ages 16-90 years) was interviewed by telephone. The questionnaire included a variety of items associated with socio-demographic characteristics, risk perceptions, illness perceptions, political attitudes and worldviews as well as intention to get vaccinated. RESULTS: More than 6 out of 10 of the respondents indicated that they planned to get vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available. The same proportion of parents also reported the intention to vaccinate their children against the disease. In multiple regression analyses, socio-cognitive factors consistently predicting influenza A/H1N1 vaccination were: level of worry, risk perception and previous experience of vaccine against seasonal flu. CONCLUSIONS: The factors found to predict vaccination intention and their distribution are assumed to be a consequence of the fact that people perceive the risk of swine flu to be similar to that of seasonal flu. As a result, in the absence of an increase of the risk perception of pandemic influenza A/H1N1, a very low level of actual vaccination is forecasted. Behavioural change would require that the risks and consequences of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 be perceived as highly different from seasonal flu.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper documents and attempts to explain the epidemic spread of tuberculosis (TB) in Russia during the 1990s. After several decades of decline, the notification rate of all new TB cases among permanent residents increased by 7.5\% per year from 1991-1999 and the death rate by 11\% per year. Growth was quickest from 1993-1995 but increased again after the economic crisis of August 1998. Approximately 120 000 new cases and 30 000 deaths were reported in 1999. Case detection and cure rates have fallen in Russia since the mid-1980s; the fall has been accompanied by a higher frequency of severe disease among cases, and higher death and case fatality rates. With a mathematical model describing the deterioration in case finding and cure rates we could replicate the average rate of increase in incidence 1991-1999 but not the precise timing of the observed changes. Other factors that probably helped to shape the observed rise in caseload include enhanced transmission due to the mixing of prison and civilian populations, an increase in susceptibility to disease, and changes in the proportion of cases detected by surveillance. Although our explanation for the resurgence of TB is incomplete, we have identified a set of measures that can be implemented now to cut transmission, incidence and deaths.},

After initial experiments on rats, the method was applied on 13 men and 6 women. Muscles with different fiber compositions (soleus, S; vastus lateralis, (VL; gastrocnemius, G; triceps brachii, TB) were studied at rest. The total water content was the same for all muscles, 320 (313-330) ml/100 g dry wt. However, differences were demonstrated for H2Oe, with 26-34 ml/100 g dry wt in VL and 38-54 ml/100 g dry wt in S, (P less than 0.05); the values for G and TB were in between those for VL and S. The differences in H2Oe were not related to the fiber composition of the muscles. During 3 x 3 min of intense bicycle exercise demanding about 120\% VO2 max (6 men), total water content increased in VL from 313 to 359 ml/100 g dry wt and H2Oe increased from 34 to 60 ml/100 g dry wt (P less than 0.05), In TB, which is relatively inactive during bicycle exercise, no such changes occurred. The calculated intracellular lactate concentration increased in VL from 5.7 to 30.6 mmol/l H2Oi. The extracellular lactate concentration amounted to 13.6 mmol/l H2Oe at the end of exercise. The concentration gradient for lactate of 2 from intra- to extracellular space favored a flux of water to the intracellular space. The relative large increase in H2Oe may then be caused by a hydrostatic rather than an osmotic factor.U},

Serum markers of bone turnover were assessed.BMD(LS) was significantly reduced at diagnosis, and remained low during therapy. BMD(TB) was normal at diagnosis, with a fast decrease in the first 32 weeks, in which chemotherapy was relatively intensive. Apparent ("volumetric") BMD(LS) was also reduced, but this did not reach significance at diagnosis and follow-up. Bone formation markers were reduced at diagnosis; formation as well as resorption markers increased during treatment. Fracture rate was 6 times higher in ALL patients compared with healthy controls. Lean body mass was decreased at baseline. Percentage of body fat increased significantly during therapy. After ALL treatment was completed, BMD and body composition tended to improve.Children with ALL are at risk for osteopenia because of the disease itself and the intensive chemotherapy.

Data simulation according to the above function was carried out with different values for the parameters Ma, Ta, Mb, Tb and K, the noise component being normally distributed with mean zero. For each set of parameters, the data generation was repeated a number of times with a different noise content and in each case, the parameters were estimated using a non-linear least square curve fitting procedure. The mean and percent coefficient of variation (CV) of each parameter was calculated. The value of CV is taken as a measure of the uncertainty in the estimated value of the parameter. It is found that the uncertainty in the estimated values of the parameters is due to the random noise. The range of data points is more critical than the number of data points used in curve fitting. Moreover, the uncertainty associated with each parameter increases with decreasing Ma/Mb ratio and increases with increasing Ta/Tb ratio. Higher signal to noise ratios will be required to analyse data with low Ma/Mb and high Ta/Tb ratios.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The present study was aimed at evaluation of a commercially available INNO-LiPA assay, for the detection of mutation in rpoB gene region of M. tuberculosis and correlate these mutations with levels of rifampicin resistance for assessing their clinical relevance.Fifty five well-characterized isolates of M. tuberculosis deposited from various regions of India in Mycobacterial Repository Centre at the CJILOMD, Agra were subjected to susceptibility testing for rifampicin at various concentrations of drug viz., 10, 40, 64, 128 microg/ml on Lowenstein- Jensen (LJ) medium. rpoB gene fragment (260 bp) was amplified using Rif-TB amplification kit and after hybridization, detection was done by using INNO-LiPA Rif TB kit.The rpoB gene could be amplified from DNA extracted from all the 55 culture isolates and showed clear hybridization pattern with M. tuberculosis complex specific probes on LiPA strips. Mutations detected were correlated with degree of rifampicin resistance. All the sensitive isolates (identified by MIC) were identified as rifampicin sensitive (100\%) by INNO-LiPA as they exhibit positive for wild type 'S' probes and negative for 'R' probes. Two of the 5 isolates, resistant at 10 microg/ml and 40 microg/ml had either D516V, H526Y mutations or unknown mutations. Thirty (85.71\%) isolates resistant at clinically relevant levels (64,128microg/ml) exhibited double, triple or more 'R' type mutations (R(2(D516V)), R(4a(H526Y)), R(4b(H526D)), R(5(S531L))) as well as unknown mutations present at 'S' probes region whereas remaining isolates did not show any mutation by this method. This method could identify with definitiveness 60 per cent ( 21/35) isolates as rifampicin resistant as mutations observed in others were also present in isolates with low levels of resistance.The results indicate that INNO-LiPA Rif TB test is a rapid and easy to use method for detection of mutations associated with rifampicin resistance in M. tuberculosis. However, as some of these mutations are also present in isolates with low degree of resistance which are still microbiologically sensitive to rifampicin, there is a need to improve this assay by exclusion of some of the current probes and inclusion of more probes.},

This approach estimated a global incidence of 39.9 million measles cases, 777,000 deaths, and 28 million disability-adjusted life years. The World Health Organization regions of Africa and Southeast Asia had 70\% of incident cases and 84\% of measles-related deaths; 11 countries alone (Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, Uganda) account for 66\% of deaths.

  Abstract                 = {Although theoretical approaches to tracheobronchial (TB) clearance have been continuously refined during the past decades, questions concerning the exact course of particle removal from the TB tree have been largely remained unsolved. In order to clarify this problem, three-dimensional patterns of mucociliary particle clearance have to be generated at pre-defined time points after particle exposure. Here, we present a mathematical method for the generation of respective clearance patterns. Three-dimensional transport paths of inhaled particles as well as spatial deposition patterns were generated by determining spatial information of all airway tubes passed by the particles and the particle deposition sites. Three-dimensional data were converted to a coordinate system, within which the trachea represented the z-axis. Visualization of stored data was realized with the help of a freely available program code that is specialized in processing huge data sets. Mucociliary clearance of deposited particular mass was computed by assuming (1) an interrelationship between mucus velocity and airway caliber and (2) an average tracheal mucus velocity of 5.5mm min(-1). Position of cleared particles within the spatial TB tree was determined at t=0 h (immediately after exposure), t=12 h and t=24 h. Spatial patterns of mucociliary clearance were computed for particles with a uniform geometric diameter of 5μm and a density of 1g cm(-3). Inhalation of the aerosol loaded with those particles took place under sitting breathing conditions (breathing frequency: 15min(-1), tidal volume: 750 ml). As demonstrated by the generated clearance patterns, mucociliary transport of 5μm particles is completed after 30 h. Within the first 12 h following aerosol exposure, about 75\% of the initially deposited particular mass is removed from the TB tree. After 24 h, 95\% of the particles have been cleared. Clearance patterns are characterized by a successive transition of maximal particle concentrations towards more proximal airway generations. For 0.1μm particles and 1μm particles clearance times are significantly prolonged, whilst 10μm particles are even faster removed from the TB tree than the 5μm particles. Based on the results of this study the time span between initial deposition of particular matter and complete evacuation of deposited particles ranges from several hours to some days and depends on (1) the preferential deposition site of the inhaled material and (2) the mean mucus velocities in the bronchial airway generations.},

  Abstract                 = {Each of six male subjects was exposed during rest to at least ten different thermal environments (Ta, 22-44 degrees C; rh, 40\%). Local sweat rates from both forearms were continuously recorded in a steady state of each exposure, using capacitance hygrometry. In the absence of spontaneous sweating, localized sweating was induced by intradermal administration of pilocarpine. Sweat expulsions synchronous at the two test areas were counted and their frequency (Fsw) was calculated. For each of additive and multiplicative combinations of Tcore (Tre, Tty) and Ts, the best combination for estimation of thermal input to the sudomotor center was determined using multiple regression analysis. Approximately 0.75Tre + 0.25Ts or 0.85Tty + 0.15Ts, and (Tre-36.33) (Ts-33.13) or (Tty-36.42) (Ts-32.24) were obtained for the additive and multiplicative combinations, respectively. The correlation coefficient (r) for the relationship of Fsw to the obtained best combination, either additive or multiplicative, and that of Fsw to Tb were almost comparable to each other. It is considered that Tb can be used as an approximation of thermal input and that the characteristics of frequency of sweat expulsion is a useful index for determining whether and how much the central sudomotor mechanism is involved in the change of sweat rate in response to various thermal and non-thermal stresses.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent increase in drug-resistant micro-organisms complicates the management of hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HA-BSIs). We investigated the epidemiology of HA-BSI and evaluated the impact of drug resistance on outcomes of critically ill patients, controlling for patient characteristics and infection management.A prospective, multicentre non-representative cohort study was conducted in 162 intensive care units (ICUs) in 24 countries.We included 1,156 patients [mean ± standard deviation (SD) age, 59.5 ± 17.7 years; 65 \% males; mean ± SD Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score, 50 ± 17] with HA-BSIs, of which 76 \% were ICU-acquired. Median time to diagnosis was 14 [interquartile range (IQR), 7-26] days after hospital admission. Polymicrobial infections accounted for 12 \% of cases. Among monomicrobial infections, 58.3 \% were gram-negative, 32.8 \% gram-positive, 7.8 \% fungal and 1.2 \% due to strict anaerobes. Overall, 629 (47.8 \%) isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR), including 270 (20.5 \%) extensively resistant (XDR), and 5 (0.4 \%) pan-drug-resistant (PDR). Micro-organism distribution and MDR occurrence varied significantly (p < 0.001) by country. The 28-day all-cause fatality rate was 36 \%. In the multivariable model including micro-organism, patient and centre variables, independent predictors of 28-day mortality included MDR isolate [odds ratio (OR), 1.49; 95 \% confidence interval (95 \%CI), 1.07-2.06], uncontrolled infection source (OR, 5.86; 95 \%CI, 2.5-13.9) and timing to adequate treatment (before day 6 since blood culture collection versus never, OR, 0.38; 95 \%CI, 0.23-0.63; since day 6 versus never, OR, 0.20; 95 \%CI, 0.08-0.47).MDR and XDR bacteria (especially gram-negative) are common in HA-BSIs in critically ill patients and are associated with increased 28-day mortality. Intensified efforts to prevent HA-BSIs and to optimize their management through adequate source control and antibiotic therapy are needed to improve outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Various infectious agents are known to be transmitted naturally via respiratory aerosols produced by infected patients. Such aerosols may be produced during normal activities by breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. The schlieren optical method, previously applied mostly in engineering and physics, can be effectively used here to visualize airflows around human subjects in such indoor situations, non-intrusively and without the need for either tracer gas or airborne particles. It accomplishes this by rendering visible the optical phase gradients owing to real-time changes in air temperature. In this study, schlieren video records are obtained of human volunteers coughing with and without wearing standard surgical and N95 masks. The object is to characterize the exhaled airflows and evaluate the effect of these commonly used masks on the fluid-dynamic mechanisms that spread infection by coughing. Further, a high-speed schlieren video of a single cough is analysed by a computerized method of tracking individual turbulent eddies, demonstrating the non-intrusive velocimetry of the expelled airflow. Results show that human coughing projects a rapid turbulent jet into the surrounding air, but that wearing a surgical or N95 mask thwarts this natural mechanism of transmitting airborne infection, either by blocking the formation of the jet (N95 mask), or by redirecting it in a less harmful direction (surgical mask).},

  Abstract                 = {The kinetics of binding of Cu(II), Tb(III) and Fe(III) to ovotransferrin have been investigated using the stopped-flow technique. Rate constants for the second-order reaction, k+, were determined by monitoring the absorbance change upon formation of the metal-transferrin complex in time range of milliseconds to seconds. The N and C sites appeared to bind a particular metal ion with the same rate; thus, average formation rate constants k+ (average) were 2.4 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 and 8.3 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 for Cu(II) and Tb(III) respectively. Site preference (N site for Cu(II) and C site for Tb(III] is then mainly due to the difference in dissociation rate constant for the metals. Fe(III) binding from Fe-nitrilotriacetate complex to apo-ovotransferrin was found to be more rapid, giving an average formation rate constant k+ (average) of 5 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, which was followed by a slow increase in absorbance at 465 nm. This slow process has an apparent rate constant in the range 3 s-1 to 0.5 s-1, depending upon the degree of Fe(III) saturation. The variation in the rate of the second phase is thought to reflect the difference in the rate of a conformational change for monoferric and diferric ovotransferrins. Monoferric ovotransferrin changes its conformation more rapidly (3.4 s-1) than diferric ovotransferrin (0.52 s-1). A further absorbance decrease was observed over a period of several minutes; this could be assigned to release of NTA from the complex, as suggested by Honda et al. (1980).},

  Abstract                 = {Decisionmakers need information about the anticipated future costs of maintaining polio eradication as a function of the policy options under consideration. Given the large portfolio of options, we reviewed and synthesized the existing cost data relevant to current policies to provide context for future policies. We model the expected future costs of different strategies for continued vaccination, surveillance, and other costs that require significant potential resource commitments. We estimate the costs of different potential policy portfolios for low-, middle-, and high-income countries to demonstrate the variability in these costs. We estimate that a global transition from routine immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) would increase the costs of managing polio globally, although routine IPV use remains less costly than routine OPV use with supplemental immunization activities. The costs of surveillance and a stockpile, while small compared to routine vaccination costs, represent important expenditures to ensure adequate response to potential outbreaks. The uncertainty and sensitivity analyses highlight important uncertainty in the aggregated costs and demonstrates that the discount rate and uncertainty in price and administration cost of IPV drives the expected incremental cost of routine IPV vs. OPV immunization.},

We investigated the relationship between severity of CHF and bone loss, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and the prognostic significance of bone mass changes in heart failure.Total body (TB) and femoral (F) bone mineral density (BMD), and T- and Z-scores in the femur were measured in 60 men with CHF (56 ± 11 years) and 13 age-matched men free from CHF. The composite study endpoint was death, implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), or inotrope dependency during a median 2-year follow-up. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D were measured in all subjects. TBBMD, FBMD, T-score, and Z-score were significantly lower in men with CHF. Their PTH levels were also significantly increased (111 ± 59 vs. 39 ± 14; P < 0.001). Patients in New York Heart Association classes III-IV compared with those in classes I-II demonstrated significantly lower TBBMD, FBMD, T-score, and Z-score, and higher PTH (136 ± 69 vs. 86 ± 31; P= 0.001). Increased PTH levels were correlated with reduced TBBMD (P = 0.003), FBMD (P = 0.002), and femur T-score (P = 0.001), reduced cardiac index (P = 0.01) and VO(2) peak (P < 0.0001), and increased wedge pressure (P = 0.001). Low TBBMD [hazard ratio (HR) 0.003, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.00-0.58; P = 0.03] and Z-score (HR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.35-0.90; P = 0.017) were associated with adverse outcome.Secondary hyperparathyroidism and reduction in bone density occur in CHF patients and are associated with disease severity.

  Abstract                 = {Achieving successful eradication of a disease requires global cooperation to obtain a shared goal. Coordination of the endgame may seem an obvious requirement for success, but that does not ensure that cooperation will occur.To analytically explore the need for cooperation to maintain global polio eradication specifically related to creation of a global polio vaccine stockpile and coordination of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation.Using risk and decision analysis and game theoretical concepts, we modeled the importance of global cooperation in managing the risks associated with polioviruses for a time horizon of 20 years after successful global disruption of circulation of wild polioviruses.Countries may wish to avoid the financial costs of vaccination and risks for vaccine-associated paralytic polio following eradication of wild polioviruses, which may lead them to reduce their use of OPV. However, reducing or stopping vaccination too soon and without coordination poses serious risks, including the possibility of reimportation of wild polioviruses and the possibility of vaccine-derived polioviruses. Analysis of the risks for potential outbreaks suggests the need for creation and maintenance of a global stockpile of vaccine for outbreak response. Game theoretical considerations show that coordination of OPV cessation optimizes expected costs and risks globally, despite the potential perceived incentives for countries to stop OPV earlier or later than other countries, or to continue OPV use indefinitely.This article makes the strong case for global cooperation on risk management and suggests that even though individual countries may perceive their own risks as small, risks at the global level warrant cooperative action and coordination of OPV cessation.},

We found cost-effectiveness ratios for switching from OPV to inactivated poliovirus vaccine to be higher (i.e., less desirable) than other health investment opportunities, depending on the actual inactivated poliovirus vaccine costs and assumptions about whether supplemental immunization activities with OPV would continue.Eradication promises billions of dollars of net benefits, although global health policy leaders face difficult choices about future policies. Until successful eradication and coordination of posteradication policies, health authorities should continue routine polio vaccination and supplemental immunization activities.},

  Abstract                 = {Dissolution testing with subsequent analysis is considered as an imperative tool for quality evaluation of the combination rifampicin-isoniazid (RIF-INH) combination. Partial least squares (PLS) regression has been successfully undertaken to select suitable predictor variables and to identify outliers for the generation of equations for RIF and INH determination in fixed-dose combinations (FDCs). The aim of this investigation was to ascertain the applicability of the described technique in testing a novel oral FDC anti-TB drug delivery system and currently available two-drug FDCs, in comparison to the United States Pharmacopeial method for analysis of RIF and INH Capsules with chromatographic determination of INH and colorimetric RIF determination. Regression equations generated employing the statistical coefficients satisfactorily predicted RIF release at each sampling point (R(2)>or=0.9350). There was an acceptable degree of correlation between the drug release data, as predicted by regressional analysis of UV spectrophotometric data, and chromatographic and colorimetric determination of INH (R(2)=0.9793 and R(2)=0.9739) and RIF (R(2)= 0.9976 and R(2)=0.9996) for the two-drug FDC and the novel oral anti-TB drug delivery system, respectively. Regressional analysis of UV spectrophotometric data for simultaneous RIF and INH prediction thus provides a simplified methodology for use in diverse research settings for the assurance of RIF bioavailability from FDC formulations, specifically modified-release forms.},

  Abstract                 = {This article seeks to advance an understanding of the spatial dynamics of one of the great emergent viral diseases of the twentieth century-poliomyelitis. From an apparently rare clinical condition occurring only sporadically or in small outbreaks before the late nineteenth century, poliomyelitis had, by the early 1950s, developed into a globally distributed epidemic disease. But, from 1955, continued growth was suddenly and dramatically reversed by the mass administration of inactivated (killed) and live (attenuated) poliovirus vaccines. After almost half a century of vaccine control, the world now stands on the brink of the global eradication of the disease. Against this background, the article draws upon information included in the U.S. Public Health Service's Public Health Reports and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report to examine the spatial dynamics of poliomyelitis during the phases of epidemic emergence (1910-1955) and vaccine-induced retreat (1955-1971) in the United States. It is shown that epidemic emergence was accompanied by shifts in the spatial center of activity from early diffusion poles in the northeastern states, to the western seaboard, and then finally to cover all the states of the Union. This was accompanied by accelerating epidemic propagation. The introduction of mass vaccination from the mid-1950s realigned spatial transmission of the disease, producing increased spatial volatility in the geographical center of activity and heightened dependence of epidemic outbreaks upon endemic reservoirs in the most populous states. Finally, the empirical results are generalized to suggest that the emergence and reemergence of many infectious diseases is a distinctively geographical process.},

The WHO requires vaccination for smallpox, cholera and yellow fever, recorded on official WHO forms. Yellow fever vaccinations are good for 10 years, and are only given at special locations. Live viral vaccines (smallpox, yellow fever and polio) should be given 3 weeks apart if possible. Contraindications against receiving these vaccines are listed, along with alternate procedures in such cases. Vaccines in the medically recommended group include typhoid-paratyphoid, tetanus, poliomyelitis, plague, typhus and immunoglobulin for infective hepatitis. A polyvalent vaccine for typhoid, paratyphoid A and B, and tetanus is available. The effectiveness of paratyphoid B vaccine is in dispute, and reactions are troublesome. Tetanus and polio immunizations are a must. Plague and typhus shots often produce reactions, and the immunity is not always good, but injections are highly recommended for those travelling in the interior of affected areas. Rabies vaccination is not recommended unless the traveller is to work as a veterinarian. Measles and BCG are suggested for children who are going to live in endemic areas.},

Drug resistance in an individual patient is often discovered only after a long delay, particularly if the diagnosis is based on current culture-based drug sensitivity testing methods. During such delays, the patient may transmit tuberculosis to his or her contacts. Rapid diagnosis of drug resistance would be expected to reduce this transmission and hence to decrease the prevalence of drug-resistant strains. To investigate this quantitatively, a mathematical model was constructed, assuming a homogeneous population structure typical of communities in South Africa where tuberculosis incidence is high. Computer simulations performed with this model showed that current control strategies will not halt the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in such communities. The simulations showed that the rapid diagnosis of drug resistance can be expected to reduce the incidence of drug-resistant cases provided the additional measure of screening within the community is implemented.},

Herein, we examined the 1889 "Russian" pandemic. Clinical attack rates were retrieved for 408 geographic entities in 14 European countries and in the United States. Case fatality ratios were estimated from datasets in the French, British and German armies, and morbidity and mortality records of Swiss cities. Weekly all-cause mortality was analyzed in 96 European and American cities. The pandemic spread rapidly, taking only 4 months to circumnavigate the planet, peaking in the United States 70 days after the original peak in St. Petersburg. The median and interquartile range of clinical attack rates was 60\% (45-70\%). The case fatality ratios ranged from 0.1\% to 0.28\%, which is comparable to those of 1957 and 1968, and 10-fold lower than in 1918. The median basic reproduction number (R(0)) was 2.1, which is comparable to the values found for the other pandemics, despite the different viruses and contact networks. R(0) values varied widely from one city to another, and only a small minority of those values was within the range in which modelers' mitigation scenarios predicted effectiveness. The 1889 and 1918 R(0) correlated for the subset of cities for which both values were available. Social and geographic factors probably shape the local R(0) , and they could be identified to design optimal mitigation scenarios tailored to each city.},

  Abstract                 = {Serial reconstructions of the membranous bronchioles (MB) were performed in randomly selected tissue blocks cut parallel to the pleural surface in fixated human lungs. Two to four normal, senile, and emphysematous lungs were examined. Three (2 in senile lungs) orders of MB were observed with a dichotomous branching pattern. Emphysematous lungs are characterized by an overall decrease in airway diameter with localized stenoses. Comparison with mean airway diameter (d) and density [n (no. of MBs per cm2 of lung tissue)] of MBs obtained using standard morphometric techniques (random sections approximately 1 cm from the pleura) showed that the values of d and n are biased because of the inclusion in the measurements of a number of respiratory bronchioles and bronchi. When these misclassifications are corrected for, it appears that d corresponds quite well to the mean diameter of the terminal bronchioles (TB) and n to approximately twice the density of TBs. After correction, n is not significantly reduced in emphysematous lungs (the grossly destroyed areas being excluded) compared with normal lungs. The estimate of the number of TBs obtained from the present data is markedly less than that calculated by Weibel (Morphometry of the Human Lung. Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1963), which suggests that the number of bronchi was overestimated by Weibel by at least one generation. Finally, values of peripheral airway resistance computed from the present anatomic data correspond quite well to direct measurement performed on the same lungs before fixation (Verbeken et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 72:2343-2353, 1992).},

Macerated sagittal slices of T12 vertebral bodies from 15 subjects were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two digital images (the second image tilted 5 degrees ) were recorded, and a 3D anaglyph was created. The thickness of the trabecular rods (Tb.Th((rods))), and the anatomical orientation of the trabecular rods were measured using an image analyser. Conventional 2D histomorphometry was performed on adjacent bone slices. A total of 1559 rod measurements were made from the 15 vertebral bone slices, with a mean Tb.Th((rods)) of 123 +/- 36 microm. The rod thickness in males (128 +/- 34 microm) was significantly greater than that in females (119 +/- 37 microm, P < 0.001). Tb.Th((rods)) changed significantly with age in the males: the thicker rods in the younger men reduced with age to a thickness similar to that in women. 3D measurements were significantly larger than the 2D estimates, and there was no correlation between the two methods of measurement. An inverse correlation was found between the number of rods and the bone volume fraction (BV/TV), indicating that decreased BV/TV is associated with an increased number of rods. The vertical rods (132 +/- 39 microm) were significantly thicker than the horizontal rods (116 +/- 33 microm, P < 0.001). The determination of rod numbers, and their orientation and individual thicknesses enables a greater understanding of cancellous bone architecture in both individuals and populations, and will allow more reliable finite element modelling. Direct measurements from 3D anaglyphs of intact specimens provide new data that show previously unrecognised age- and sex-related changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is defined as a form of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) with additional resistance to fluoroquinolones and at least one of the injectable drugs used in tuberculosis treatment: amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin. It was classified by WHO as a serious threat to tuberculosis (TB) control, with world-wide consequences, taking on the proportions of a real pandemic in some regions.To compare patients with XDR-TB versus other MDR-TB profiles with regard to epidemiological and demographic characteristics, aetiopathogenic factors and inhospital outcomes.Patients admitted to Pulido Valente Hospital (Pulmonology Service III) in the period ranging from April 1999 to June 2007 with MDR-TB diagnosis microbiologically confirmed. The following variables were evaluated: gender, age, race, forms of TB presentation, treatment groups, resistance profile, immigrant status, number and duration of previous treatments, WHO classification, HIV co-infection, alcoholism and/or drug addiction, average length of hospital stay and inhospital mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version 15.0. In categorical variables, the statistical differences between groups were evaluated by the Chi-square test and numeric variables using the T-test. Logistical regression analysis was used to build the predictive model of XDR-TB existence (dependent variable), which included the following independent variables: WHO classification, HIV co-infection, immigrant status, alcoholism and/or drug addiction and number and duration of previous treatments.We recorded 132 patients with MDR-TB, of which 69 (52.3\%) were XDR-TB. Statistically significant differences were observed in the following variables: race (black race was associated with XDRTB in 74\% of cases versus 46\% of the Caucasian race); WHO classification (patients with retreatment for therapeutic failure, stopping treatment or relapse were 69.5\% of XDR-TB cases versus 44.5\% of Not XDR-TB cases; average duration of previous treatments (4.2 months for XDR-TB cases versus 2.8 months for Not XDR-TB cases); HIV co-infection (patients with HIV co-infection constituted 65.2\% of XDR-TB cases versus 42.9\% of Not XDR-TB cases), mortality (33.3\% in patients with XDR-TB versus 14.3\% in Not XDR-TB patients).The variables with predictive value for the diagnosis of XDR-TB vs. Not XDR-TB were presence of HIV co-infection (odds ratio [OR] for XDRTB 2.5; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 - 5.05) and increased average duration of previous treatments ([OR] for XDR-TB 1.2; 95\% [CI], 1.11 - 2.30).},

  Abstract                 = {Influenza vaccination coverage among health-care workers (HCWs) remains the lowest compared with other priority groups for immunization. Little is known about the acceptability and compliance with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine among HCWs during the current campaign. Between 23 December 2009 and 13 January 2010, once the workplace vaccination program was over, we conducted a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey at the University Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain). Five hundred twenty-seven HCWs were asked about their influenza immunization history during the 2009-2010 season, as well as the reasons for accepting or declining either the seasonal or pandemic vaccines. Multiple logistic-regression analysis was preformed to identify variables associated with immunization acceptance. A total of 262 HCWs (49.7\%) reported having received the seasonal vaccine, while only 87 (16.5\%) affirmed having received the pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 vaccine. "Self-protection" and "protection of the patient" were the most frequently adduced reasons for acceptance of the pandemic vaccination, whereas the existence of "doubts about vaccine efficacy" and "fear of adverse reactions" were the main arguments for refusal. Simultaneous receipt of the seasonal vaccine (odds ratio [OR]: 0.27; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: 0.14-0.52) and being a staff (OR: 0.08; 95\% CI: 0.04-0.19) or a resident physician (OR: 0.16; 95\% CI: 0.05-0.50) emerged as independent predictors for pandemic vaccine acceptance, whereas self-reported membership of a priority group was associated with refusal (OR: 5.98; 95\% CI: 1.35-26.5). The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccination coverage among the HCWs in our institution was very low (16.5\%), suggesting the role of specific attitudinal barriers and misconceptions about immunization in a global pandemic scenario.},

There is evidence of 12\% to 20\% or more increases in the absolute level of immunization coverage and 33\% to 100\% increases in relative coverage compared to baselines when communication is included as a key component of immunization strengthening.

Five of the identified compounds show significant in vitro activity against H37Rv strains (MICs in the range of 2.5-80 mg/L) and clinical MTB strains, including MDR and XDR isolates. More impressively, compounds 5 and 7 can enhance the killing ability against macrophages infected pathogen remarkably.

TbNi(2)Mn(x) crystallizes in the MgCu(2)-type structure (space group Fd3m). The additional contributions to the magnetic energy terms from transition-metal-transition-metal interactions (T-T) and rare-earth-transition-metal interactions (R-T) in RNi(2)Mn compounds contribute to their increased magnetic ordering temperatures compared with RNi(2) and RMn(2). Both the lattice constant a and the Curie temperature T(C) exhibit maximal values at the x = 1 composition indicating strong magnetostructural coupling. Analyses of the AC magnetic susceptibility and DC magnetization data of TbNi(2)Mn around the Curie temperature T(C) = 147 K confirm that the magnetic transition is second order with critical exponents β = 0.77 ± 0.12, γ = 1.09 ± 0.07 and δ = 2.51 ± 0.06. These exponents establish that the magnetic interactions in TbNi(2)Mn are long range despite mixed occupancies of Tb and Mn atoms at the 8a site and vacancies. The magnetic entropy - ΔS(M) around T(C) is proportional to (μ(0)H/T(C))(2/3) in agreement with the critical magnetic analyses. The Mössbauer spectra above T(C) are fitted by two sub-spectra in agreement with refinement of the x-ray data while below T(C) three sub-spectra are required to represent the three inequivalent local magnetic environments.},

In the present study, we measure hepatic protein synthesis in vivo using a flooding dose of tracer amino acid, and in vitro in hepatocytes freshly isolated from tumor-bearing (TB) and pair-fed control rats. Increased protein synthesis was observed for the TB rats using both methods of analysis. However, the degree of stimulation seen in the TB animals was much greater in the in vitro assay than in the in vivo approach, suggesting that absolute protein synthetic rates in vitro must be interpreted with caution when extrapolating to the in vivo state.},

  Abstract                 = {Wild poliovirus has remained endemic in northern Nigeria because of low coverage achieved in the routine immunization program and in supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). An outbreak of infection involving 315 cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2; >1\% divergent from Sabin 2) occurred during July 2005-June 2010, a period when 23 of 34 SIAs used monovalent or bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) lacking Sabin 2. In addition, 21 "pre-VDPV2" (0.5\%-1.0\% divergent) cases occurred during this period. Both cVDPV and pre-VDPV cases were clinically indistinguishable from cases due to wild poliovirus. The monthly incidence of cases increased sharply in early 2009, as more children aged without trivalent OPV SIAs. Cumulative state incidence of pre-VDPV2/cVDPV2 was correlated with low childhood immunization against poliovirus type 2 assessed by various means.

  Abstract                 = {Vaccination rates of children in Germany are unsatisfying and regional endemic outbreaks have been reported. Few studies have analysed physicians' attitude towards vaccination. We investigated whether there is an association between physicians' attitude and vaccination coverage on the regional level for Germany.In a representative cross-sectional survey, anonymized questionnaires were sent to random samples of all paediatricians (50\%) and general practitioners (10\%) in private practice in Germany. Attitude towards vaccination was operationalized in three scores. Measles and pertussis vaccination coverage rates were obtained from the 16 Federal States' Health Departments. Geographic methods and linear regression models were used for analysis.A total of 2010 paediatricians (response proportion: 64.1\%) and 1712 general practitioners (response proportion 39.1\%) were included in the analysis. We found an association of physicians' attitude towards vaccination and vaccination coverage rate (P < 0.0001). There is also an important association between vaccination coverage and the geographic location, with lower coverage rates especially in the States of former Western Germany (compared with our reference State Mecklenburg - Western Pomerania; pertussis: maximum -5.86\% in Bavaria, P < 0.0001; measles: maximum -20.20\% in Berlin, P = 0.0002).The regional association between vaccination coverage rates and physicians' attitude towards vaccination seems to be superposed by population-related variables. An increase of vaccination coverage requires better information and training of both, physicians and the general population.},

  Abstract                 = {Since time immemorial animals have been a major source of human infectious disease. Certain infections like rabies are recognized as zoonoses caused in each case by direct animal-to-human transmission. Others like measles became independently sustained with the human population so that the causative virus has diverged from its animal progenitor. Recent examples of direct zoonoses are variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease arising from bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and the H5N1 avian in£uenza outbreak in Hong Kong. Epidemics of recent animal origin are the 1918-1919 in£uenza pandemic, and acquired immune de¢ciency syndrome caused by human immunodefficiency virus (HIV). Some retroviruses jump into and out of the chromosomal DNA of the host germline, so that they oscillate between being inherited Mendelian traits or infectious agents in di¡erent species. Will new procedures like animal-to-human transplants unleash further infections? Do microbes become more virulent upon cross-species transfer ? Are animal microbes a threat as biological weapons? Will the vast reservoir of immunodefficient hosts due to the HIV pandemic provide conditions permissive for sporadic zoonoses to take off as human-tohuman transmissible diseases ? Do human infections now pose a threat to endangered primates? These questions are addressed in this lecture.}

Efforts are underway to link mutations with drug resistance and to develop strain collections to enable assessment of new diagnostic assays. In resource-limited settings, DST might not be appropriate for all patients with tuberculosis. Surveillance data and modelling will help country stakeholders to design appropriate DST algorithms and to decide whether to change drug regimens. Finally, development of practical DST assays is needed so that, in countries where surveillance and modelling show that DST is advisable, these assays can be used to guide clinical decisions for individual patients. If combined judiciously during both development and implementation, new tuberculosis regimens and new DST assays have enormous potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of disease.},

As HIV continues to spread, warnings have been issued of disastrous AIDS and TB epidemics in "new-wave" countries, including India, which accounts for 20\% of all new TB cases arising in the world each year. Here we investigate whether, in the face of the HIV epidemic, India's Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP) could halve TB prevalence and death rates in the period 1990-2015, as specified by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Using a mathematical model to capture the spatial and temporal variation in TB and HIV in India, we predict that, without the RNTCP, HIV would increase TB prevalence (by 1\%), incidence (by 12\%), and mortality rates (by 33\%) between 1990 and 2015. With the RNTCP, however, we expect substantial reductions in prevalence (by 68\%), incidence (by 41\%), and mortality (by 39\%) between 1990 and 2015. In India, 29\% of adults but 72\% of HIV-positive adults live in four large states in the south where, even with the RNTCP, mortality is expected to fall by only 15\% between 1990 and 2015. Nationally, the RNTCP should be able to reverse the increases in TB burden due to HIV but, to ensure that TB mortality is reduced by 50\% or more by 2015, HIV-infected TB patients should be provided with antiretroviral therapy in addition to the recommended treatment for TB.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV has increased the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) by up to sevenfold in African countries, but antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the incidence of AIDS-related TB. We use a mathematical model to investigate the short-term and long-term impacts of ART on the incidence of TB, assuming that people are tested for HIV once a year, on average, and start ART at a fixed time after HIV seroconversion or at a fixed CD4(+) cell count. We fit the model to trend data on HIV prevalence and TB incidence in nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa. If HIV-positive people start ART within 5 y of seroconversion, the incidence of AIDS-related TB in 2015 will be reduced by 48\% (range: 37-55\%). Long-term reductions depend sensitively on the delay to starting ART. If treatment is started 5, 2, or 1 y after HIV seroconversion, or as soon as people test positive, the incidence in 2050 will be reduced by 66\% (range: 57-80\%), 95\% (range: 93-96\%), 97.7\% (range: 96.9-98.2\%) and 98.4\% (range: 97.8-98.9\%), respectively. In the countries considered here, early ART could avert 0.71 ± 0.36 [95\% confidence interval (CI)] million of 3.4 million cases of TB between 2010 and 2015 and 5.8 ± 2.9 (95\% CI) million of 15 million cases between 2015 and 2050. As more countries provide ART at higher CD4(+) cell counts, the impact on TB should be investigated to test the predictions of this model.},

We developed dynamic mathematical models to predict the distribution of CD4+ cell counts in HIV-positive adults using the distribution in HIV-negative adults.Under the assumption that survival is independent of the CD4+ cell count before seroconversion, we fitted the observed distributions in HIV-positive adults. At a CD4+ cell count of 200 cells/microL, the median life expectancy of HIV-positive Zambians (4.0 years) was predicted to be 1.7 times that of HIV-positive South Africans (2.3 years).The model provides a way to estimate the changing distribution of CD4+ cell counts and, hence, the changing incidence of HIV-related opportunistic infections as the epidemic matures. This could substantially improve the planning of health services, including the need and demand for antiretroviral therapy. Better data are needed to test the model and its assumptions more rigorously and to fully understand the variability in CD4+ cell counts within and among populations.},

Mixing of bilayer lipids was monitored with an assay based on resonance energy transfer (RET) and mixing of aqueous vesicle contents with the Tb/dipicolinate assay. The results obtained with either assay were analyzed in terms of a mass action kinetic model, providing separate rate constants for vesicle aggregation and for the fusion reaction proper. At different Ca2+ concentrations, either at 25 degrees C or at 37 degrees C, aggregation rate constants derived from the data obtained with the RET assay were the same as those derived from the Tb/dipicolinate data, indicating that mixing of bilayer lipids occurred only during vesicle aggregation events that resulted in mixing of aqueous contents as well. At 25 degrees C, identical fusion rate constants were obtained with either assay, indicating that at this temperature the probability of lipid mixing and that of aqueous contents mixing, occurring after vesicle aggregation, were the same. The fusion rate constants for the RET assay increased more steeply with increasing temperature than the fusion rate constants derived from the Tb/dipicolinate data. As a result, at 37 degrees C the tendency of the vesicles, after aggregation, to mix lipids was slightly higher than their tendency to mix aqueous contents. The aggregation rate constants increased steeply with Ca2+ concentrations increasing in a narrow range (9.5-11 mM), indicating that, in addition to a Ca2+-dependent charge neutralization on the vesicle surface, structural changes in the lipid bilayer are involved in the aggregation process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Separate rate constants for vesicle aggregation as well as deaggregation and for the fusion reaction itself were determined by analysis of the data in terms of a mass action kinetic model. At 15 degrees C the aggregation rate constants for either assay are the same, indicating that at this temperature all vesicle aggregation events that result in lipid mixing lead to mixing of aqueous contents as well. By contrast, at 35 degrees C the RET aggregation rate constants are higher than the Tb/DPA aggregation rate constants, indicating a significant frequency of reversible vesicle aggregation events that do result in mixing of bilayer lipids, but not in mixing of aqueous vesicle contents. In any conditions, the RET fusion rate constants are considerably higher than the Tb/DPA fusion rate constants, demonstrating the higher tendency of the vesicles, once aggregated, to mix lipids than to mix aqueous contents. This possibly reflects the formation of an intermediate fusion structure. With increasing Ca2+ concentrations the RET and the Tb/DPA fusion rate constants increase in parallel with the respective aggregation rate constants. This suggests that fusion susceptibility is conferred on the vesicles during the process of vesicle aggregation and not solely as a result of the interaction of Ca2+ with isolated vesicles. Aggregation of the vesicles in the presence of Mg2+ produces neither mixing of aqueous vesicle contents nor mixing of bilayer lipids.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied the 75-225 msec portion of the auditory evoked response (AER) in 32 normal adults at vertex (Cz) and temporal (T3 and T4) placements referred to a balanced, noncephalic reference electrode using a monaural 1 msec click stimulus delivered every 4.7 sec at 60 dB above threshold. The tape-recorded EEG was filtered at 1-25 c/sec, and 128 individual responses were summed, sampling every 0.5 msec for 250 msec post-stimulation. The Cz AERs showed the classic vertex response, a negative peak, N1, at 100 msec, followed by a positive peak, P2, at 160-200 msec. The T3 and T4 AERs were similar to the Cz AERs from 0 to 80 msec and from 200 to 250 msec. They differed significantly from the Cz AERs from 80 to 200 msec. The difference is best explained by the hypothesis that the Cz AERs consisted of N1P2, while the T3 and T4 AERs consisted of N1P2 plus an additional superimposed component, which we called the T complex, comprising a positive peak, Ta, at 105-110 msec, and a negative peak, Tb, at 150-160 msec. By computer, the corresponding Cz and T3 or T4 AERs were normalized to equalize their amplitudes, and the former was subtracted from the latter, thus isolating the T complex. The Ta peak was found to occur 1.5 +/- 1.6 msec earlier at the electrode contralateral to stimulation, and 2.2 +/- 4.0 msec earlier at the T4 (right) electrode. Both differences were statistically significant. The T complex amplitude was greater at the electrode contralateral to stimulation and at the T4 electrode. These findings appear to resolve current controversies concerning the form of the temporal AER. While N1P2 is apparently a product of widespread areas of cortex, we conclude that the T complex is probably a product of secondary auditory cortex.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the first reports of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria in southeast Asia and South America almost half a century ago, drug-resistant malaria has posed a major problem in malaria control. By the late 1980s, resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and to mefloquine was also prevalent on the Thai-Cambodian and Thai-Myanmar (Thai-Burmese) borders, rendering them established multidrug-resistant (MDR) areas. Chloroquine resistance spread across Africa during the 1980s, and severe resistance is especially found in east Africa. As a result, more than ten African countries have switched their first-line drug to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Of great concern is the fact that the efficacy of this drug in Africa is progressively deteriorating, especially in foci in east Africa, which are classified as emerging MDR areas. Urgent efforts are needed to lengthen the lifespan of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and to identify effective, affordable, alternative antimalarial regimens. Molecular markers for antimalarial resistance have been identified, including pfcrt polymorphisms associated with chloroquine resistance and dhfr and dhps polymorphisms associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. Polymorphisms in pfmdr1 may also be associated with resistance to chloroquine, mefloquine, quinine, and artemisinin. Use of such genetic information for the early detection of resistance foci and future monitoring of drug-resistant malaria is a potentially useful epidemiological tool, in conjunction with the conventional in-vivo and in-vitro drug-sensitivity assessments. This review describes the various features of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, including its determinants, current status in diverse geographical areas, molecular markers, and their implications.},

  Abstract                 = {The Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance has been gathering data since 1994. This study provides the latest data on the extent of drug resistance worldwide.Data for drug susceptibility were gathered from 90 726 patients in 83 countries and territories between 2002 and 2007. Standardised collection of results enabled comparison both between and within countries. Where possible, data for HIV status and resistance to second-line drugs were also obtained. Laboratory data were quality assured by the Supranational Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory Network.The median prevalence of resistance to any drug in new cases of tuberculosis was 11.1\% (IQR 7.0-22.3). The prevalence of multidrug resistance in new tuberculosis cases ranged from 0\% in eight countries to 7\% in two provinces in China, 11.1\% in Northern Mariana Islands (although reporting only two cases), and between 6.8\% and 22.3\% in nine countries of the former Soviet Union, including 19.4\% in Moldova and 22.3\% in Baku, Azerbaijan (median for countries surveyed 1.6\%, IQR 0.6-3.9). Trend analysis showed that between 1994 and 2007, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in new cases increased substantially in South Korea and in Tomsk Oblast and Orel Oblast, Russia, but was stable in Estonia and Latvia. The prevalence of MDR tuberculosis in all tuberculosis cases decreased in Hong Kong and the USA. 37 countries and territories reported representative data on extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. Five countries, all from the former Soviet Union, reported 25 cases or more of XDR tuberculosis each, with prevalence among MDR-tuberculosis cases ranging between 6.6\% and 23.7\%.MDR tuberculosis remains a threat to tuberculosis control in provinces in China and countries of the former Soviet Union. Data on drug resistance are unavailable in many countries, especially in Africa, emphasising the need to develop easier methods for surveillance of resistance in tuberculosis.Global Project: United States Agency for International Development and Eli Lilly and Company.

  Abstract                 = {The global tuberculosis (TB) control plan has historically emphasized passive case finding (PCF) as the most practical approach for identifying TB suspects in high burden settings. The success of this approach in controlling TB depends on infectious individuals recognizing their symptoms and voluntarily seeking diagnosis rapidly enough to reduce onward transmission. It now appears, at least in some settings, that more intensified case-finding (ICF) approaches may be needed to control TB transmission; these more aggressive approaches for detecting as-yet undiagnosed cases obviously require additional resources to implement. Given that TB control programs are resource constrained and that the incremental yield of ICF is expected to wane over time as the pool of undiagnosed cases is depleted, a tool that can help policymakers to identify when to implement or suspend an ICF intervention would be valuable. In this article, we propose dynamic case-finding policies that allow policymakers to use existing observations about the epidemic and resource availability to determine when to switch between PCF and ICF to efficiently use resources to optimize population health. Using mathematical models of TB/HIV coepidemics, we show that dynamic policies strictly dominate static policies that prespecify a frequency and duration of rounds of ICF. We also find that the use of a diagnostic tool with better sensitivity for detecting smear-negative cases (e.g., Xpert MTB/RIF) further improves the incremental benefit of these dynamic case-finding policies.},

  Abstract                 = {The enterohepatic circulation of cefixime in rat was evaluated by a nonlinear least square analysis program, MULTI(FILT), into which the fast inverse Laplace transform (FILT) was incorporated. The plasma time course in the bile duct-cannulated rat exhibited a biexponential curve after the rapid iv administration of cefixime. Several pharmacokinetic models for the enterohepatic circulation were constructed based on the recirculatory concept and the Laplace-transformed equations corresponding to these models were derived by means of the method of transfer function. The transformed equations were simultaneously fitted to the time courses of plasma concentration in rats with laparotomy and with bile duct cannula. The optimum model was selected based on the Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The local moment characteristics for a single pass through enterohepatic circulation were further calculated from the time courses of both the plasma concentration and the amount excreted into the bile. The recovery ratio (Fc) and the mean circulatory time (-tc) through a single pass of enterohepatic circulation were estimated 27.9\% and 1.07 hr, respectively. The recovery ratio (Fa) and the mean absorption time (-tc) for the absorption process from the intestinal tract into the systemic circulation were 68.3\% and 0.0234 hr, respectively.

  Abstract                 = {There is mounting evidence that the aerosol transmission route plays a significant role in the spread of influenza in temperate regions and that the efficiency of this route depends on humidity. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms by which humidity might influence transmissibility via the aerosol route have not been elucidated. We hypothesize that airborne concentrations of infectious influenza A viruses (IAVs) vary with humidity through its influence on virus inactivation rate and respiratory droplet size. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which humidity might influence aerosol transmission, we modeled the size distribution and dynamics of IAVs emitted from a cough in typical residential and public settings over a relative humidity (RH) range of 10-90\%. The model incorporates the size transformation of virus-containing droplets due to evaporation and then removal by gravitational settling, ventilation, and virus inactivation. The predicted concentration of infectious IAVs in air is 2.4 times higher at 10\% RH than at 90\% RH after 10 min in a residential setting, and this ratio grows over time. Settling is important for removal of large droplets containing large amounts of IAVs, while ventilation and inactivation are relatively more important for removal of IAVs associated with droplets <5 µm. The inactivation rate increases linearly with RH; at the highest RH, inactivation can remove up to 28\% of IAVs in 10 min. Humidity is an important variable in aerosol transmission of IAVs because it both induces droplet size transformation and affects IAV inactivation rates. Our model advances a mechanistic understanding of the aerosol transmission route, and results complement recent studies on the relationship between humidity and influenza's seasonality. Maintaining a high indoor RH and ventilation rate may help reduce chances of IAV infection.},

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate prevalence odds ratios (with 95\% CI) to compare foreign-born (FB) to US-born travelers for various levels of knowledge and behaviors.Although the majority of participants were aware of influenza prevention measures, only 41\% reported receiving the influenza vaccine during the previous season. Forty-three percent of participants reported seeking at least one type of pre-travel health advice, which was significantly higher among US-born, Caucasians, traveling for purposes other than visiting friends and relatives, travelers who received the influenza vaccine during the previous season, and those traveling with a companion. Our study also showed that Asians, FB travelers, and those working in occupations other than health care/animal care were less likely to recognize H5N1 AI transmission risk factors.The basic public health messages for preventing influenza appear to be well understood, but the uptake of influenza vaccine was low. Clinicians should ensure that all patients receive influenza vaccine prior to travel. Tailored communication messages should be developed to motivate Asians, FB travelers, those visiting friends and relatives, and those traveling alone to seek pre-travel health advice as well as to orient them with H5N1 AI risk factors.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to increasing drug resistance, available antimicrobial options are limited in the treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii infections. Particularly in cases caused by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii, combination regimens must also be taken into consideration. In this study, the efficacies of tigecycline, colistin and tigecycline/colistin combination on bacterial counts in lung tissue were investigated in a rat pneumonia model. One A. baumannii strain resistant to all antimicrobial agents except tigecycline and colistin was selected for the study. In vivo studies revealed a >3 log reduction in bacterial counts in the tigecycline, colistin and combination groups at 24 h and 48 h compared with the control group. No significant differences were determined between colistin, tigecycline and combination groups (P>0.05). On the other hand, differences between treatment groups and the control group were statistically significant (P=0.01). A greater reduction in bacterial counts was observed at 48 h compared with 24 h in the tigecycline group than in the colistin group (P=0.038 and P=0.139, respectively); the most significant decrease between 24 h and 48 h was observed in the combination group (P=0.014). Despite detection of in vitro synergistic activity in this study, no statistically significant differences were found between colistin, tigecycline and combination treatments in terms of efficacy on bacterial counts in lung tissue. In the treatment of infections with a high mortality rate such as pneumonia caused by XDR A. baumannii, combining tigecycline with colistin during the first 48 h and continuing treatment with one of these agents seems a rational approach.},

The proposed system was evaluated in vitro for particle morphology, lag time and floating time, loading rate, release profile, and the release kinetic of AZT release. AZT's physico-chemical characteristics were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XDR) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). The particles obtained were sphere-shaped, hollow, and had porous walls. The floating was immediate, and floating time was higher than 12 h. The loading rate was 34.0 ± 9.0\%. The system obtained had an extended release. DSC and XDR results showed a modification in AZT's solid state. IR spectroscopy revealed that the chemical structure of the AZT was unchanged. The hollow microballoons presented gastroretentive, floating, and extended-release properties.},

  Abstract                 = {The scarcity of grafts available necessitates a system that considers expected posttransplant survival, in addition to pretransplant mortality as estimated by the MELD. So far, however, conventional linear techniques have failed to achieve sufficient accuracy in posttransplant outcome prediction. In this study, we aim to develop a pretransplant predictive model for liver recipients' survival with benign end-stage liver diseases (BESLD) by a nonlinear method based on pretransplant characteristics, and compare its performance with a BESLD-specific prognostic model (MELD) and a general-illness severity model (the sequential organ failure assessment score, or SOFA score).With retrospectively collected data on 360 recipients receiving deceased-donor transplantation for BESLD between February 1999 and August 2009 in the west China hospital of Sichuan university, we developed a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to predict one-year and two-year survival probability after transplantation. The performances of the MLP, SOFA, and MELD were assessed by measuring both calibration ability and discriminative power, with Hosmer-Lemeshow test and receiver operating characteristic analysis, respectively. By the forward stepwise selection, donor age and BMI; serum concentration of HB, Crea, ALB, TB, ALT, INR, Na(+); presence of pretransplant diabetes; dialysis prior to transplantation, and microbiologically proven sepsis were identified to be the optimal input features. The MLP, employing 18 input neurons and 12 hidden neurons, yielded high predictive accuracy, with c-statistic of 0.91 (P<0.001) in one-year and 0.88 (P<0.001) in two-year prediction. The performances of SOFA and MELD were fairly poor in prognostic assessment, with c-statistics of 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, in one-year prediction, and 0.67 and 0.65 in two-year prediction.The posttransplant prognosis is a multidimensional nonlinear problem, and the MLP can achieve significantly high accuracy than SOFA and MELD scores in posttransplant survival prediction. The pattern recognition methodologies like MLP hold promise for solving posttransplant outcome prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) is an emerging global health threat. Proper management of close contacts of infectious patients is increasingly important. However, no evidence-based recommendations for treating latent TB infection (LTBI) after MDR/XDR-TB exposure (DR-LTBI) exist. An ultrashort regimen for LTBI caused by drug-susceptible strains (DS-LTBI) is also desirable. TMC207 has bactericidal and sterilizing activity in animal models of TB and improves the activity of current MDR-TB therapy in patients.The objective of this study was to determine whether TMC207 might enable short-course treatment of DR-LTBI and ultrashort treatment of DS-LTBI.Using an established experimental model of LTBI chemotherapy in which mice are aerosol-immunized with a recombinant bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine before low-dose aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the efficacy of TMC207 alone and in combination with rifapentine was compared with currently recommended control regimens as well as once-weekly rifapentine + isoniazid and daily rifapentine ± isoniazid.Outcomes included monthly lung colony-forming unit counts and relapse rates.Lung colony-forming unit counts were stable at about 3.75 log(10) for up to 7.5 months postinfection in untreated mice. Rifamycin-containing regimens were superior to isoniazid monotherapy. TMC207 exhibited sterilizing activity at least as strong as that of rifampin alone and similar to that of rifampin + isoniazid, but daily rifapentine +/- isoniazid was superior to TMC207. Addition of TMC207 to rifapentine did not improve the sterilizing activity of rifapentine in this model.TMC207 has substantial sterilizing activity and may enable treatment of DR-LTBI in 3-4 months.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis was declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1993. Following the declaration and the promotion in 1995 of directly observed treatment short course (DOTS), a cost-effective strategy to contain the tuberculosis epidemic, nearly 7 million lives have been saved compared with the pre-DOTS era, high cure rates have been achieved in most countries worldwide, and the global incidence of tuberculosis has been in a slow decline since the early 2000s. However, the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, and more recently, totally drug-resistant tuberculosis pose a threat to global tuberculosis control. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a man-made problem. Laboratory facilities for drug susceptibility testing are inadequate in most tuberculosis-endemic countries, especially in Africa; thus diagnosis is missed, routine surveillance is not implemented, and the actual numbers of global drug-resistant tuberculosis cases have yet to be estimated. This exposes an ominous situation and reveals an urgent need for commitment by national programs to health system improvement because the response to MDR tuberculosis requires strong health services in general. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and XDR tuberculosis greatly complicate patient management within resource-poor national tuberculosis programs, reducing treatment efficacy and increasing the cost of treatment to the extent that it could bankrupt healthcare financing in tuberculosis-endemic areas. Why, despite nearly 20 years of WHO-promoted activity and >12 years of MDR tuberculosis-specific activity, has the country response to the drug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic been so ineffectual? The current dilemmas, unanswered questions, operational issues, challenges, and priority needs for global drug resistance screening and surveillance, improved treatment regimens, and management of outcomes and prevention of DR tuberculosis are discussed.},

  abstract        = {Estimates of influenza-associated mortality are important for national and international decision making on public health priorities. Previous estimates of 250 000-500 000 annual influenza deaths are outdated. We updated the estimated number of global annual influenza-associated respiratory deaths using country-specific influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality estimates from 1999-2015. We estimated country-specific influenza-associated respiratory excess mortality rates (EMR) for 33 countries using time series log-linear regression models with vital death records and influenza surveillance data. To extrapolate estimates to countries without data, we divided countries into three analytic divisions for three age groups (<65 years, 65-74 years, and ≥75 years) using WHO Global Health Estimate (GHE) respiratory infection mortality rates. We calculated mortality rate ratios (MRR) to account for differences in risk of influenza death across countries by comparing GHE respiratory infection mortality rates from countries without EMR estimates with those with estimates. To calculate death estimates for individual countries within each age-specific analytic division, we multiplied randomly selected mean annual EMRs by the country's MRR and population. Global 95% credible interval (CrI) estimates were obtained from the posterior distribution of the sum of country-specific estimates to represent the range of possible influenza-associated deaths in a season or year. We calculated influenza-associated deaths for children younger than 5 years for 92 countries with high rates of mortality due to respiratory infection using the same methods. EMR-contributing countries represented 57% of the global population. The estimated mean annual influenza-associated respiratory EMR ranged from 0·1 to 6·4 per 100 000 individuals for people younger than 65 years, 2·9 to 44·0 per 100 000 individuals for people aged between 65 and 74 years, and 17·9 to 223·5 per 100 000 for people older than 75 years. We estimated that 291 243-645 832 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths (4·0-8·8 per 100 000 individuals) occur annually. The highest mortality rates were estimated in sub-Saharan Africa (2·8-16·5 per 100 000 individuals), southeast Asia (3·5-9·2 per 100 000 individuals), and among people aged 75 years or older (51·3-99·4 per 100 000 individuals). For 92 countries, we estimated that among children younger than 5 years, 9243-105 690 influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually. These global influenza-associated respiratory mortality estimates are higher than previously reported, suggesting that previous estimates might have underestimated disease burden. The contribution of non-respiratory causes of death to global influenza-associated mortality should be investigated. None.},

  abstract        = {Seasonal influenza virus is a common cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in young children. In 2008, we estimated that 20 million influenza-virus-associated ALRI and 1 million influenza-virus-associated severe ALRI occurred in children under 5 years globally. Despite this substantial burden, only a few low-income and middle-income countries have adopted routine influenza vaccination policies for children and, where present, these have achieved only low or unknown levels of vaccine uptake. Moreover, the influenza burden might have changed due to the emergence and circulation of influenza A/H1N1pdm09. We aimed to incorporate new data to update estimates of the global number of cases, hospital admissions, and mortality from influenza-virus-associated respiratory infections in children under 5 years in 2018. We estimated the regional and global burden of influenza-associated respiratory infections in children under 5 years from a systematic review of 100 studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2018, and a further 57 high-quality unpublished studies. We adapted the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the risk of bias. We estimated incidence and hospitalisation rates of influenza-virus-associated respiratory infections by severity, case ascertainment, region, and age. We estimated in-hospital deaths from influenza virus ALRI by combining hospital admissions and in-hospital case-fatality ratios of influenza virus ALRI. We estimated the upper bound of influenza virus-associated ALRI deaths based on the number of in-hospital deaths, US paediatric influenza-associated death data, and population-based childhood all-cause pneumonia mortality data in six sites in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. In 2018, among children under 5 years globally, there were an estimated 109·5 million influenza virus episodes (uncertainty range [UR] 63·1-190·6), 10·1 million influenza-virus-associated ALRI cases (6·8-15·1); 870 000 influenza-virus-associated ALRI hospital admissions (543 000-1 415 000), 15 300 in-hospital deaths (5800-43 800), and up to 34 800 (13 200-97 200) overall influenza-virus-associated ALRI deaths. Influenza virus accounted for 7% of ALRI cases, 5% of ALRI hospital admissions, and 4% of ALRI deaths in children under 5 years. About 23% of the hospital admissions and 36% of the in-hospital deaths were in infants under 6 months. About 82% of the in-hospital deaths occurred in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. A large proportion of the influenza-associated burden occurs among young infants and in low-income and lower middle-income countries. Our findings provide new and important evidence for maternal and paediatric influenza immunisation, and should inform future immunisation policy particularly in low-income and middle-income countries.

  abstract        = {Since the progressive introduction of the meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine within Africa's meningitis belt beginning in 2010, the burden of meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (NmA) has substantially decreased. Non-A serogroups C/W/X are now the most prevalent. Surveillance within the belt has historically focused on the clinical syndrome of meningitis, the classic presentation for NmA, and may not adequately capture other presentations of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). The clinical presentation of infection due to serogroups C/W/X includes nonmeningeal IMD, and there is a higher case-fatality ratio associated with these non-A serogroups; however, data on the nonmeningeal IMD burden within the belt are scarce. Expanding surveillance to capture all cases of IMD, in accordance with the World Health Organization's updated vaccine-preventable disease surveillance standards and in preparation for the anticipated introduction of a multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine within Africa's meningitis belt, will enhance meningococcal disease prevention across the belt.},

  abstract        = {Historically, the major cause of meningococcal epidemics in the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa has been Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (NmA), but the incidence has been substantially reduced since the introduction of a serogroup A conjugate vaccine starting in 2010. We performed whole-genome sequencing on isolates collected post-2010 to assess their phylogenetic relationships and inter-country transmission. A total of 716 invasive meningococcal isolates collected between 2011 and 2016 from 11 meningitis belt countries were whole-genome sequenced for molecular characterization by the three WHO Collaborating Centers for Meningitis. We identified three previously-reported clonal complexes (CC): CC11 (n = 434), CC181 (n = 62) and CC5 (n = 90) primarily associated with NmW, NmX, and NmA, respectively, and an emerging CC10217 (n = 126) associated with NmC. CC11 expanded throughout the meningitis belt independent of the 2000 Hajj outbreak strain, with isolates from Central African countries forming a distinct sub-lineage within this expansion. Two major sub-lineages were identified for CC181 isolates, one mainly expanding in West African countries and the other found in Chad. CC10217 isolates from the large outbreaks in Nigeria and Niger were more closely related than those from the few cases in Mali and Burkina Faso. Whole-genome based phylogenies revealed geographically distinct strain circulation as well as inter-country transmission events. Our results stress the importance of continued meningococcal molecular surveillance in the region, as well as the development of an affordable vaccine targeting these strains.

  abstract        = {Meningococcal carriage dynamics drive patterns of invasive disease. The distribution of carriage by age has been well described in Europe, but not in the African meningitis belt, a region characterised by frequent epidemics of meningitis. We aimed to estimate the age-specific prevalence of meningococcal carriage by season in the African meningitis belt. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and grey literature for papers reporting carriage of Neisseria meningitidis in defined age groups in the African meningitis belt. We used a mixed-effects logistic regression to model meningococcal carriage prevalence as a function of age, adjusting for season, location and year. Carriage prevalence increased from low prevalence in infants (0.595% in the rainy season, 95% CI 0.482-0.852%) to a broad peak at age 10 (1.94%, 95% CI 1.87-2.47%), then decreased in adolescence. The odds of carriage were significantly increased during the dry season (OR 1.5 95% CI 1.4-1.7) and during outbreaks (OR 6.7 95% CI 1.6-29). Meningococcal carriage in the African meningitis belt peaks at a younger age compared to Europe. This is consistent with contact studies in Africa, which show that children 10-14 years have the highest frequency of contacts. Targeting older children in Africa for conjugate vaccination may be effective in reducing meningococcal transmission.},

  abstract        = {Bacterial meningitis remains a major threat for the population of the meningitis belt. Between 2004 and 2009, in the countries of this belt, more than 200,000 people were infected with a 10% mortality rate. However, for almost 20 years, important meningitis epidemics are also reported outside this belt. Research is still very poorly developed in this part of the word like in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which experiences recurrent epidemics. This article describes for the first time the spatio-temporal patterns of meningitis cases and epidemics in DRC, in order to provide new insights for surveillance and control measures. Based on weekly suspected cases of meningitis (2000-2012), we used time-series analyses to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of the disease. We also used both geographic information systems and geostatistics to identify spatial clusters of cases. Both using conventional statistics and the Cleveland's algorithm for decomposition into general trend, seasonal and residuals, we searched for the existence of seasonality. We observed a low rate of biological confirmation of cases (11%) using soluble antigens search, culture and PCR. The main strains found are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis (A and C) serogroups. We identified 8 distinct spatial clusters, located in the northeastern and southeastern part of DRC, and in the capital city province, Kinshasa. A low seasonal trend was observed with higher incidence and attack rate of meningitis during the dry season, with a high heterogeneity in seasonal patterns occurring across the different districts and regions of DRC. Despite challenges related to completeness of data reporting, meningitis dynamics shows weak seasonality in DRC. This tends to suggest that climatic, environmental factors might be less preponderant in shaping seasonal patterns in central Africa. The characterization of 8 distinct clusters of meningitis could be used for a better sentinel meningitis surveillance and optimization of vaccine strategy in DRC. Improving biological monitoring of suspected cases should be a priority for future eco-epidemiological studies to better understand the emergence and spread of meningitis pathogens, and the potential ecological, environmental drivers of this disease.},

We describe bacterial meningitis epidemiology in these 5 countries in 2015-2017. Case-based meningitis surveillance collects case-level demographic and clinical information and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) laboratory results. Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae cases were confirmed and N. meningitidis/H. influenzae were serogrouped/serotyped by real-time polymerase chain reaction, culture, or latex agglutination. We calculated annual incidence in participating districts in each country in cases/100 000 population. From 2015-2017, 18 262 suspected meningitis cases were reported; 92% had a CSF specimen available, of which 26% were confirmed as N. meningitidis (n = 2433; 56%), S. pneumoniae (n = 1758; 40%), or H. influenzae (n = 180; 4%). Average annual incidences for N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae, respectively, were 7.5, 2.5, and 0.3. N. meningitidis incidence was 1.5 in Burkina Faso, 2.7 in Chad, 0.4 in Mali, 14.7 in Niger, and 12.5 in Togo. Several outbreaks occurred: NmC in Niger in 2015-2017, NmC in Mali in 2016, and NmW in Togo in 2016-2017. Of N. meningitidis cases, 53% were NmC, 30% NmW, and 13% NmX. Five NmA cases were reported (Burkina Faso, 2015). NmX increased from 0.6% of N. meningitidis cases in 2015 to 27% in 2017. Although bacterial meningitis epidemiology varied widely by country, NmC and NmW caused several outbreaks, NmX increased although was not associated with outbreaks, and overall NmA incidence remained low. An effective low-cost multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine could help further control meningococcal meningitis in the region.},

In the changing context of a reduction in incidence of serogroup A and an increase in incidence of serogroups W and C and of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a better understanding of the determinants driving the disease transmission dynamics remains crucial to improving bacterial meningitis control. The literature was searched to provide a multi-disciplinary overview of the determinants of meningitis transmission dynamics in the African meningitis belt. Seasonal hyperendemicity is likely predominantly caused by increased invasion rates, sporadic localized epidemics by increased transmission rates, and larger pluri-annual epidemic waves by changing population immunity. Carriage likely involves competition for colonization and cross-immunity. The duration of immunity likely depends on the acquisition type. Major risk factors include dust and low humidity, and presumably human contact rates and co-infections; social studies highlighted environmental and dietary factors, with supernatural explanations. Efforts should focus on implementing multi-country, longitudinal seroprevalence and epidemiological studies, validating immune markers of protection, and improving surveillance, including more systematic molecular characterizations of the bacteria. Integrating climate and social factors into disease control strategies represents a high priority for optimizing the public health response and anticipating the geographic evolution of the African meningitis belt.},

  abstract     = {The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the seasonal dynamic and epidemic occurrence of bacterial meningitis in the African meningitis belt remain unknown. Regular seasonality (seasonal hyperendemicity) is observed for both meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis and understanding this is critical for better prevention and modelling. The two principal hypotheses for hyperendemicity during the dry season imply (1) an increased risk of invasive disease given asymptomatic carriage of meningococci and pneumococci; or (2) an increased transmission of these bacteria from carriers and ill individuals. In this study, we formulated three compartmental deterministic models of seasonal hyperendemicity, featuring one (model1-'inv' or model2-'transm'), or a combination (model3-'inv-transm') of the two hypotheses. We parameterised the models based on current knowledge on meningococcal and pneumococcal biology and pathophysiology. We compared the three models' performance in reproducing weekly incidences of suspected cases of acute bacterial meningitis reported by health centres in Burkina Faso during 2004-2010, through the meningitis surveillance system. The three models performed well (coefficient of determination R2, 0.72, 0.86 and 0.87, respectively). Model2-'transm' and model3-'inv-transm' better captured the amplitude of the seasonal incidence. However, model2-'transm' required a higher constant invasion rate for a similar average baseline transmission rate. The results suggest that a combination of seasonal changes of the risk of invasive disease and carriage transmission is involved in the hyperendemic seasonality of bacterial meningitis in the African meningitis belt. Consequently, both interventions reducing the risk of nasopharyngeal invasion and the bacteria transmission, especially during the dry season are believed to be needed to limit the recurrent seasonality of bacterial meningitis in the meningitis belt.},

  abstract        = {In sub-Saharan Africa, bacterial meningitis remains a significant public health problem, especially in the countries of the meningitis belt, where Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A historically caused large-scale epidemics. In 2014, MenAfriNet was established as a consortium of partners supporting strategic implementation of case-based meningitis surveillance to monitor meningitis epidemiology and impact of meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine (MACV). MenAfriNet improved data quality through use of standardized tools, procedures, and laboratory diagnostics. MenAfriNet surveillance and study data provided evidence of ongoing MACV impact, characterized the burden of non-serogroup A meningococcal disease (including the emergence of a new epidemic clone of serogroup C), and documented the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. New vaccines and schedules have been proposed for future implementation to address the remaining burden of meningitis. To support the goals of "Defeating Meningitis by 2030," MenAfriNet will continue to strengthen surveillance and support research and modeling to monitor the impact of these programs on meningitis burden in sub-Saharan Africa.},

  abstract        = {Information on transmission of meningococcal infection in the African meningitis belt is scarce. We aimed to describe transmission patterns of Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) in households in the African meningitis belt. Cross-sectional carriage surveys were done in seven African meningitis belt countries (Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal) between Aug 1, 2010, and Oct 15, 2012. Meningococcal carriers identified in these surveys and all available people in their households were recruited into this longitudinal cohort study. We took pharyngeal swabs at first visit and took further swabs twice a month for 2 months and then monthly for a further 4 months. We used conventional bacteriological and molecular techniques to identify and characterise meningococci. We estimated the rates of carriage acquisition and recovery using a multi-state Markov model. Meningococci were isolated from 241 (25%) of 980 members of 133 households in which a carrier had been identified in the cross-sectional survey or at the first household visit. Carriage was detected subsequently in another household member who was not an index carrier in 75 households. Transmission within a household, suggested by detection of a further carrier with the same strain as the index carrier, was found in 52 of these 75 households. Children younger than 5 years were the group that most frequently acquired carriage from other household members. The overall individual acquisition rate was 2·4% (95% CI 1·6-4·0) per month, varying by age and household carriage status. The mean duration of carriage was 3·4 months (95% CI 2·7-4·4). In the African meningitis belt, transmission of meningococci within households is important, particularly for young children, and periods of carriage are usually of short duration.

It has been applied to 128 cities of the USSR, and more recently, to forecasting the spread of the pandemic of 1968-1969 throughout 52 large cities. It is a deterministic, mass-action, space and time continuous model. The model has been applied to the simulation of the influenza epidemic of 1984-1985 in the 22 French Metropolitan districts and results are presented. Estimates of the parameters of the model were made using the French Communicable Diseases Network data. These parameters are the contact rate, a, (estimate = 0.55) which is the number of people with whom an infectious individual will make contact daily sufficient to pass infection and the infectious period, 1/b, estimated as 2.49 days. The mean annual railroad passenger traffic from district i to district j varies from 0 to 1,991,000 persons depending on the districts. The computer spread of the epidemic is presented on weekly maps. Results are also presented on district charts, giving the size of district epidemics and the time of peak of the epidemic. The precision of the computer fittings was judged satisfactory by the calculated size of peak differing from the real one by less than 100 per cent, in 17 out of 18 districts, and by the calculated time of peak differing from the observed by less than two weeks in 14 out of 18 districts. Although precision could be improved with more detailed information about passenger traffic, the French use of the model has been satisfactory.},

  abstract        = {The experimental evidence available for animal and plant RNA viruses, as well as other RNA genetic elements (viroids, satellites, retroelements, etc.), reinforces the view that many different types of genetic alterations may occur during RNA genome replication. This is fundamentally because of infidelity of genome replication and large population sizes. Homologous and heterologous recombination, as well as gene reassortments occur frequently during replication of retroviruses and most riboviruses, especially those that use enzymes with limited processivity. Following the generation of variant genomes, selection, which is dependent on environmental parameters in ways that are poorly understood, sorts out those genome fits enough to generate viable quasispecies. Chance events can also be destabilizing, as illustrated by recent results on fitness loss and other phenotypic changes accompanying bottleneck transmission. Variation, selection, and random sampling of genomes occur continuously and unavoidably during virus evolution. Evolution of RNA viruses is largely unpredictable because of the stochastic nature of mutation and recombination events, as well as the subtle effects of chance transmission events and host/environmental factors. Among environmental factors, alterations resulting from human intervention (deforestation, agricultural activities, global climatic changes, etc.) may alter dispersal patterns and provide new adaptive possibilities to viral quasispecies. Current understanding of RNA virus evolution suggests several strategies to control and diagnose viral diseases. The new generation of chemically defined vaccines and diagnostic reagents (monoclonal antibodies, peptide antigens, oligonucleotides for polymerase chain reaction amplification, etc.) may be adequate to prevent disease and detect some or even most of the circulating quasispecies of any given RNA pathogen. However, the dynamics of viral quasispecies mandate careful consideration of those reagents to be incorporated into diagnostic kits. Broadening diagnosis without jeopardizing specificity of detection will be challenging. There is a finite probability (impossible to quantify at present) that a defined vaccine may promote selection of escape mutants or a particular diagnostic kit may fail to detect a viral pathogen. Of particular concern are the potential long-term effects of weak selective pressures that may initially go unnoticed. Variant viruses resulting from evolutionary pressure imposed by vaccines or drugs may insidiously and gradually replace previous quasispecies. The great potential for variation and phenotypic diversity of some important RNA virus pathogens (human immunodeficiency virus, the hepatitis viruses, the newly recognized human hantaviruses, etc.) has become clear. Prevention and therapy should rely on multicomponent vaccines and antiviral agents to address the complexity of RNA quasispecies mutant spectra.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

According to World Health Organisation (WHO) this appears to be the first severe and easily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Though much about the disease remains poorly understood, including the details of the causative virus, we do know that it has features that allow it to spread rapidly along international air travel routes. As of 10 May 2003, a cumulative 7296 probable SARS cases with 526 deaths have been reported from 30 countries on three continents (WHO, ProMED). In the past week, more than 1000 new probable cases and 96 deaths were reported globally. This represents an increase of 119 new cases and 8 new deaths compared with 9 May 2003 (China (85), Taiwan (23), and Hong Kong (7) represented the overwhelming majority, with one additional case each reported from France, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United States). Only in China, as of 10 May 2003 (WHO) total of 4884 with 235 deaths have been reported. Some outbreaks have reassuring features.},

  abstract        = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in Southern China in November 2002, and was brought to Hong Kong in February 2003. From Hong Kong, the disease spread rapidly worldwide but mostly to Asian countries. At the end of the epidemic in June, the global cumulative total was 8422 cases with 916 deaths (case fatality rate of 11%). People of all ages were affected, but predominantly females. Health care workers were at high risk and accounted for one-fifth of all cases. Risk factors for death included old age and comorbid illnesses, especially diabetes. The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus and is transmitted by droplets or direct inoculation from contact with infected surfaces. Contaminated sewage was found to be responsible for the outbreak in a housing estate in Hong Kong affecting over 300 residents. The mean incubation period was 6.4 days (range 2-10). The duration between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation was from 3 to 5 days. The relatively prolonged incubation period allowed asymptomatic air travellers to spread the disease globally. The number of individuals infected by each case has been estimated to be 2.7. Effective control of nosocomial transmission included early detection of disease, strict isolation of patients, practice of droplet and contact precautions and compliance with the use of personal protective equipment. Effective control of disease spread in the community included tracing and quarantine of contacts.

  abstract        = {Large scale simulations of the movements of people in a "virtual" city and their analyses are used to generate insights into understanding the dynamic processes that depend on the interactions between people. Models, based on these interactions, can be used in optimizing traffic flow, slowing the spread of infectious diseases, or predicting the change in cell phone usage in a disaster. We analyzed cumulative and aggregated data generated from the simulated movements of 1.6 x 10(6) individuals in a computer (pseudo-agent-based) model during a typical day in Portland, Oregon. This city is mapped into a graph with 181,206 nodes representing physical locations such as buildings. Connecting edges model individual's flow between nodes. Edge weights are constructed from the daily traffic of individuals moving between locations. The number of edges leaving a node (out-degree), the edge weights (out-traffic), and the edge weights per location (total out-traffic) are fitted well by power-law distributions. The power-law distributions also fit subgraphs based on work, school, and social/recreational activities. The resulting weighted graph is a "small world" and has scaling laws consistent with an underlying hierarchical structure. We also explore the time evolution of the largest connected component and the distribution of the component sizes. We observe a strong linear correlation between the out-degree and total out-traffic distributions and significant levels of clustering. We discuss how these network features can be used to characterize social networks and their relationship to dynamic processes.},

  abstract        = {To prevent SARS from spreading through air travel and in order to rebuild the confidence of the traveling public in the safety of air travel, ICAO has set up an "Anti-SARS Airport Evaluation Project." The first phase of this project was to develop a set of protective measures for international airports in affected areas to adopt and implement and then to send out, on the request of Contracting States, a team of inspectors to evaluate and assess airports and issue a "statement of evaluation" that the airport inspected complies with the ICAO anti-SARS protective measures. In cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO), the first part of phase 1 was completed in early June this year, and the second part of phase 1 followed soon after. By mid-July, five international airports in Southeast Asia had been inspected and found to be in full compliance with the ICAO anti-SARS protective measures. The success of this ICAO project is believed to have contributed significantly to the recovery of international air travel and related industries now taking place. Phase 2 of the project is now being developed. It is aimed at preventing a resurgence of SARS, but it also contains elements to make the methodology developed applicable to future outbreaks of any other communicable disease in which the mode of transmission could involve aviation and/or the need to prevent the spread of the disease by air travel.},

  abstract        = {A worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been associated with exposures originating from a single ill health care worker from Guangdong Province, China. We conducted studies to identify the etiologic agent of this outbreak. We received clinical specimens from patients in seven countries and tested them, using virus-isolation techniques, electron-microscopical and histologic studies, and molecular and serologic assays, in an attempt to identify a wide range of potential pathogens. None of the previously described respiratory pathogens were consistently identified. However, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients who met the case definition of SARS. Cytopathological features were noted in Vero E6 cells inoculated with a throat-swab specimen. Electron-microscopical examination revealed ultrastructural features characteristic of coronaviruses. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining revealed reactivity with group I coronavirus polyclonal antibodies. Consensus coronavirus primers designed to amplify a fragment of the polymerase gene by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to obtain a sequence that clearly identified the isolate as a unique coronavirus only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses. With specific diagnostic RT-PCR primers we identified several identical nucleotide sequences in 12 patients from several locations, a finding consistent with a point-source outbreak. Indirect fluorescence antibody tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays made with the new isolate have been used to demonstrate a virus-specific serologic response. This virus may never before have circulated in the U.S. population. A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence indicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS. Because of the death of Dr. Carlo Urbani, we propose that our first isolate be named the Urbani strain of SARS-associated coronavirus.},

Control is achieved by culling infectious holdings when they are discovered and by the pre-emptive culling of livestock on holdings deemed to be at enhanced risk of infection. Because the pre-emptive control programme cannot directly identify exposed holdings, its implementation will result in the removal of both infected and uninfected holdings. This leads to a fundamental trade-off: increased levels of control produce a greater reduction in transmission by removing more exposed holdings, but increase the number of uninfected holdings culled. We derive an expression for the total number of holdings culled during the course of an outbreak and demonstrate that there is an optimal control policy, which minimizes this loss. Using a metapopulation model to incorporate local clustering of infection, we examine a neighbourhood control programme in a locally spreading outbreak. We find that there is an optimal level of control, which increases with increasing basic reproduction ratio, R(0); moreover, implementation of control may be optimal even when R(0) < 1. The total loss to the population is relatively insensitive to the level of control as it increases beyond the optimal level, suggesting that over-control is a safer policy than under-control.},

  abstract        = {Beijing, China, experienced the world's largest outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) beginning in March 2003, with the outbreak resolving rapidly, within 6 weeks of its peak in late April. Little is known about the control measures implemented during this outbreak. To describe and evaluate the measures undertaken to control the SARS outbreak. Data were reviewed from standardized surveillance forms from SARS cases (2521 probable cases) and their close contacts observed in Beijing between March 5, 2003, and May 29, 2003. Procedures implemented by health authorities were investigated through review of official documents and discussions with public health officials. Timeline of major control measures; number of cases and quarantined close contacts and attack rates, with changes in infection control measures, management, and triage of suspected cases; and time lag between illness onset and hospitalization with information dissemination. Health care worker training in use of personal protective equipment and management of patients with SARS and establishing fever clinics and designated SARS wards in hospitals predated the steepest decline in cases. During the outbreak, 30 178 persons were quarantined. Among 2195 quarantined close contacts in 5 districts, the attack rate was 6.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3%-7.3%), with a range of 15.4% (95% CI, 11.5%-19.2%) among spouses to 0.36% (95% CI, 0%-0.77%) among work and school contacts. The attack rate among quarantined household members increased with age from 5.0% (95% CI, 0%-10.5%) in children younger than 10 years to 27.6% (95% CI, 18.2%-37.0%) in adults aged 60 to 69 years. Among almost 14 million people screened for fever at the airport, train stations, and roadside checkpoints, only 12 were found to have probable SARS. The national and municipal governments held 13 press conferences about SARS. The time lag between illness onset and hospitalization decreased from a median of 5 to 6 days on or before April 20, 2003, the day the outbreak was announced to the public, to 2 days after April 20 (P<.001). The rapid resolution of the SARS outbreak was multifactorial, involving improvements in management and triage in hospitals and communities of patients with suspected SARS and the dissemination of information to health care workers and the public.},

The independent effectiveness of measures to "increase social distance" and wearing masks in public places requires further evaluation. Limited data exist on the effectiveness of providing health information to travelers. Entry screening of travelers through health declarations or thermal scanning at international borders had little documented effect on detecting SARS cases; exit screening appeared slightly more effective. The value of border screening in deterring travel by ill persons and in building public confidence remains unquantified. Interventions to control global epidemics should be based on expert advice from the World Health Organization and national authorities. In the case of SARS, interventions at a country's borders should not detract from efforts to identify and isolate infected persons within the country, monitor or quarantine their contacts, and strengthen infection control in healthcare settings.},

  abstract        = {The paucity of outbreak data from biologic terrorism and emerging infectious diseases limits the evaluation of syndromic surveillance systems. Evaluation using naturally occurring outbreaks of proxy disease (e.g., influenza) is one alternative but does not allow for rigorous evaluation. Another approach is to inject simulated outbreaks into real background data, but existing simulation models generally do not account for such factors as spatial mobility and do not explicitly incorporate knowledge of the disease agent. The objective of this analysis was to design a simulated anthrax epidemic injection model that accounts for the complexity of the background data and enables sensitivity analyses based on uncertain disease-agent characteristics. MODEL REQUIREMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS: Model requirements are described and used to limit the scope of model development. Major assumptions used to limit model complexity are also described. Available literature on inhalational anthrax is reviewed to ensure that the level of model detail reflects available disease knowledge. MODEL DESIGN: The model is divided into four components: 1) agent dispersion, 2) infection, 3) disease and behavior, and 4) data source. The agent-dispersion component uses a Gaussian plume model to compute spore counts on a fine grid. The infection component uses a cohort approach to identify infected persons by residential zip code, accounting for demographic covariates and spatial mobility. The disease and behavior component uses a discrete-event approach to simulate progression through disease stages and health-services utilization. The data-source component generates records to insert into background data sources. An epidemic simulation model was designed to enable evaluation of syndromic surveillance systems. The model addresses limitations of existing simulation approaches by accounting for such factors as spatial mobility and by explicitly modeling disease knowledge. Subsequent work entails software implementation and model validation.},

Ten secondary cases spread the infection to two hospitals in Hong Kong and to Singapore, Toronto and Hanoi. In March 2003 a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was found to be the causative agent. Within 11 weeks from the first SARS case in Hong Kong it had spread to an additional 27 countries or special administrative regions. The mini pandemic peaked during the last week of May 2003 and the last new probable case was on July 13, 2003. There were a total of 8096 probable cases and 774 deaths. Sixty-six per cent of the cases occurred in China, 22% in Hong Kong, 4% in Taiwan and 3% in both Singapore and Canada. Twenty-one per cent of all cases occurred in healthcare workers.},

  abstract        = {The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is still threatening the world because of a possible resurgence. In the current situation that effective medical treatments such as antiviral drugs are not discovered yet, dynamical features of the epidemics should be clarified for establishing strategies for tracing, quarantine, isolation, and regulating social behavior of the public at appropriate costs. Here we propose a network model for SARS epidemics and discuss why superspreaders emerged and why SARS spread especially in hospitals, which were key factors of the recent outbreak. We suggest that superspreaders are biologically contagious patients, and they may amplify the spreads by going to potentially contagious places such as hospitals. To avoid mass transmission in hospitals, it may be a good measure to treat suspected cases without hospitalizing them. Finally, we indicate that SARS probably propagates in small-world networks associated with human contacts and that the biological nature of individuals and social group properties are factors more important than the heterogeneous rates of social contacts among individuals. This is in marked contrast with epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases or computer viruses to which scale-free network models often apply.},

We analyzed the temporal and spatial distributions of cases in a large community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and examined the correlation of these data with the three-dimensional spread of a virus-laden aerosol plume that was modeled using studies of airflow dynamics. We determined the distribution of the initial 187 cases of SARS in the Amoy Gardens housing complex in 2003 according to the date of onset and location of residence. We then studied the association between the location (building, floor, and direction the apartment unit faced) and the probability of infection using logistic regression. The spread of the airborne, virus-laden aerosols generated by the index patient was modeled with the use of airflow-dynamics studies, including studies performed with the use of computational fluid-dynamics and multizone modeling. The curves of the epidemic suggested a common source of the outbreak. All but 5 patients lived in seven buildings (A to G), and the index patient and more than half the other patients with SARS (99 patients) lived in building E. Residents of the floors at the middle and upper levels in building E were at a significantly higher risk than residents on lower floors; this finding is consistent with a rising plume of contaminated warm air in the air shaft generated from a middle-level apartment unit. The risks for the different units matched the virus concentrations predicted with the use of multizone modeling. The distribution of risk in buildings B, C, and D corresponded well with the three-dimensional spread of virus-laden aerosols predicted with the use of computational fluid-dynamics modeling. Airborne spread of the virus appears to explain this large community outbreak of SARS, and future efforts at prevention and control must take into consideration the potential for airborne spread of this virus.},

Furthermore, the minimal number of individuals that must be tested if the probability P has to be lower than a fixed value is determined as a function of pi. If all n tests result negative, confidence intervals for pi are given both in the frequentistic and Bayesian approach.

A model simulating the spread of a pathogen transmitted by direct contact (such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) was constructed. The modulation of pathogen dissemination attending changes in clinically relevant pathogen- and institution-specific factors was then systematically examined. The model was configured as a hypothetical 24-bed intensive care unit. The model can be parameterized with different pathogen transmissibilities, durations of caregiver and/or patient contamination, and caregiver allocation and flow patterns. Pathogen- and institution-specific factors examined included pathogen transmissibility, duration of caregiver contamination, regional cohorting of contaminated or infected patients, delayed detection and isolation of newly contaminated patients, reduction of the number of caregiver visits, and alteration of caregiver allocation among patients. The model predicts the probability that a given fraction of the population will become contaminated or infected with the pathogen of interest under specified spatial, initial prevalence, and dynamic conditions. Per-encounter pathogen acquisition risk and the duration of caregiver pathogen carriage most strongly affect dissemination. Regional cohorting and rapid detection and isolation of contaminated patients each markedly diminish the likelihood of dissemination even absent other interventions. Strategies reducing "crossover" between caregiver domains diminish the likelihood of more widespread dissemination. Spatially explicit discrete element models, such as the model presented, may prove useful for analyzing the transmission of pathogens within the intensive care unit.},

We conclude that research should be directed more intensively toward the characterization of sexual network structures, together with qualitative and quantitative analyses of the immune responses of individuals who are identifiable within the network structure itself. Elucidation of the immunobiological and behavioral factors that shape STI transmission should inform better STI prevention and control programs.},

If the basic reproductive number (R0) was below 1.60, our simulations showed that a prepared response with targeted antivirals would have a high probability of containing the disease. In that case, an antiviral agent stockpile on the order of 100,000 to 1 million courses for treatment and prophylaxis would be sufficient. If pre-vaccination occurred, then targeted antiviral prophylaxis could be effective for containing strains with an R0 as high as 2.1. Combinations of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, pre-vaccination, and quarantine could contain strains with an R(0) as high as 2.4.},

  abstract        = {To measure the spatial contagion of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing and to test the different epidemic factors of the spread of SARS in different periods. A join-count spatial statistic study was conducted and the given hypothetical processes of the spread of SARS in Beijing were tested using various definitions of 'joins'. The spatial statistics showed that of the six diffusion processes, the highest negative autocorrelation occurred in the doctor-number model (M-5) and the lowest negative autocorrelation was found in the population-amount model (M-3). The results also showed that in the whole 29-day research period, about hour or more days experienced a significant degree of contagion. Spatial analysis is helpful in understanding the spatial diffusion process of an epidemic. The geographical relationships were important during the early phase of the SARS epidemic in Beijing. The statistic based on the number of doctors was significant and more informative than that of the number of hospitals. It reveals that doctors were important in the spread of SARS in Beijing, and hospitals were not as important as doctors in the contagion period. People are the key to the spread of SARS, but the population density was more significant than the population size, although they were both important throughout the whole period.},

The patterns of these contacts tend to be highly heterogeneous. Traditional "compartmental" modeling in epidemiology, however, assumes that population groups are fully mixed, that is, every individual has an equal chance of spreading the disease to every other. Applications of compartmental models to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) resulted in estimates of the fundamental quantity called the basic reproductive number R0--the number of new cases of SARS resulting from a single initial case--above one, implying that, without public health intervention, most outbreaks should spark large-scale epidemics. Here we compare these predictions to the early epidemiology of SARS. We apply the methods of contact network epidemiology to illustrate that for a single value of R0, any two outbreaks, even in the same setting, may have very different epidemiological outcomes. We offer quantitative insight into the heterogeneity of SARS outbreaks worldwide, and illustrate the utility of this approach for assessing public health strategies.},

This disease which is now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is believed to have had its origins in the Guangdong Province of China, and was the cause of a multi-country epidemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been coordinating the international response to provide the epidemiological, laboratory, clinical and logistic requirements needed to contain this disease.A rapid spread of SARS around the world occurred at its onset, facilitated greatly by air travel. Between November 2002 and July 2003, a total of 8,094 cases and 774 cases were reported from 26 countries worldwide.WHO responded quickly to this multi-country outbreak and on 12 March released a "global alert" about SARS. This was followed by the first WHO travel advisory on 15 March. The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network was activated, and international experts were brought together to implement enhanced global surveillance systems for SARS.The international community has learned a lot of lessons from the SARS outbreak. Particularly, rapid and transparent information sharing between countries is critical to prevent international spread of the disease. However, information exchange was less than optimal in the early phase of the outbreak.},

We used contact network epidemiology to predict the effect of various control policies for a mildly contagious disease, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, and a moderately contagious disease, such as smallpox. The success of an intervention depends on the transmissibility of the disease and the contact pattern between persons within a community. The model predicts that use of face masks and general vaccination will only moderately affect the spread of mildly contagious diseases. In contrast, quarantine and ring vaccination can prevent the spread of a wide spectrum of diseases. Contact network epidemiology can provide valuable quantitative input to public health decisionmaking, even before a pathogen is well characterized.},

The critical feature of this model is that the community is modelled as a small-world network of interconnected nodes. Each node is linked to a fixed number of immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically remote nodes. Transmission can only propagate between linked nodes. This model exhibits two features typical of SARS transmission: geographically localized outbreaks and "super-spreaders". Neither of these features are evident in standard susceptible-infected-removed models of disease transmission. Our analysis indicates that "super-spreaders" may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant. Moreover, we find that nosocomial transmission in Hong Kong directly contributed to the severity of the outbreak and that by limiting individual exposure time to 3-5 days the extent of the SARS epidemic would have been minimal.},

Based on the data of SARS in 2003 and the geographic information system of Beijing, as well as under the broad range of the theorems and techniques of data-driven and model-driven knowledge mining, hierarchical techniques were used to test the hot spots. Wavelet technique was also used to decompose Moran's I frequency to survey the spatial clustering process of SARS. For factors analysis, BW test was used to distinguish factors which influencing SARS process. In temporal aspects, susceptive-infective-removal model (SIR) without Taylor expansion was solved by a genetic-simulated annealing algorithm, that directly provided a new approach to obtain epidemic parameters from the SIR model. Different order of spatial hot spots were noticed and the clustering were relevant with the means of transportation. Diffusion dynamics were changed along with the temporal process of SARS. Regarding factor analysis, geographic relationship, population density, the amount of doctors and hospitals appeared to be the key elements influencing the transmission of SARS. The predictable number of SARS cases evolving with time were also calculated. Cluster detection of close contacts of SARS infective in Beijing revealed the spatial characters of urban population flow and having important implications in the prevention and control of this communicable diseases. Some human and physical environment factors played statistical significant roles in different periods during SARS epidemics. An efficient algorithm was developed to solve SIR model directly, enabling the estimation of epidemic parameters from SIR and early forecast.},

At the bacteria level, patients infected with these strains generate both nonresistant and resistant bacteria. At the patient level, susceptible patients are infected by infected patients at rates proportional to the total bacteria load of each strain present in the hospital. The objectives of this paper are to analyze the dynamic elements of nonresistant and resistant bacteria strains in epidemic populations in hospital environments and to provide understanding of measures to avoid the endemicity of resistant antibiotic strains.},

The outbreak of this novel disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (the SARS-coronavirus), hit hardest in the Asian Pacific region, though eventually it spread to five continents. The speed of the spread of the SARS epidemic was unprecedented due to the highly efficient intercontinental transportation. An international collaborative effort through the World Health Organization (WHO) has helped to identify the aetiological agent about 1 month after the onset of the epidemic. The power of molecular biology and bioinformatics has enabled the complete decoding of the viral genome within weeks. Over 1000 publications on the phylogeny, epidemiology, genomics, laboratory diagnostics, antiviral, immunization, pathogenesis, clinical disease, and management accumulated within just 1 year. Although the exact animal reservoir of virus and how it evolved into a human pathogen are still obscure, accurate diagnosis and epidemiological control of the disease are now possible.

All inpatients who had stayed in the same ward as the initial index case patient for any duration before isolation were recruited into a cohort and followed up to document the occurrence of SARS. The normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols at different locations of the ward was estimated by use of computational fluid dynamics modeling. The attack rates in the various subgroups stratified by bed location were calculated. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to document important risk factors. The overall attack rate of SARS was 41% (30 of 74 subjects). It was 65%, 52%, and 18% in the same bay, adjacent bay, and distant bays, respectively (P = .001). Computation fluid dynamics modeling indicated that the normalized concentration of virus-laden aerosols was highest in the same bay and lowest in the distant bays. Cox regression indicated that staying in the ward on 6 or 10 March entailed higher risk, as well as staying in the same or adjacent bays. The epidemic curve showed 2 peaks, and stratified analyses by bed location suggested >1 generation of spread. The temporal-spatial spread of SARS in the ward was consistent with airborne transmission, as modeled by use of computational fluid dynamics. Infected health care workers likely acted as secondary sources in the latter phase of the outbreak.},

  abstract        = {The threat of avian influenza and the 2004-2005 influenza vaccine supply shortage in the United States have sparked a debate about optimal vaccination strategies to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality caused by the influenza virus. We present a comparative analysis of two classes of suggested vaccination strategies: mortality-based strategies that target high-risk populations and morbidity-based strategies that target high-prevalence populations. Applying the methods of contact network epidemiology to a model of disease transmission in a large urban population, we assume that vaccine supplies are limited and then evaluate the efficacy of these strategies across a wide range of viral transmission rates and for two different age-specific mortality distributions. We find that the optimal strategy depends critically on the viral transmission level (reproductive rate) of the virus: morbidity-based strategies outperform mortality-based strategies for moderately transmissible strains, while the reverse is true for highly transmissible strains. These results hold for a range of mortality rates reported for prior influenza epidemics and pandemics. Furthermore, we show that vaccination delays and multiple introductions of disease into the community have a more detrimental impact on morbidity-based strategies than mortality-based strategies. If public health officials have reasonable estimates of the viral transmission rate and the frequency of new introductions into the community prior to an outbreak, then these methods can guide the design of optimal vaccination priorities. When such information is unreliable or not available, as is often the case, this study recommends mortality-based vaccination priorities.},

  abstract     = {In fewer than four months in 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread from China to 25 countries and Taiwan, becoming the first new, easily transmissible infectious disease of the twenty-first century. The role of air transport in the diffusion of the disease became obvious early in the crisis; to assess that role more carefully, this study relates the spatial-temporal pattern of the SARS outbreak to a measure of airline network accessibility. Specifically, the accessibility from those countries that were infected by SARS, beginning with China, to other countries was measured using airline schedules. The country-pair accessibility measure, along with other country-level factors relevant to the disease, were tested as determinants of the speed with which SARS arrived in infected countries as well as its failure to arrive in most countries. The analyses indicate that airline network accessibility was an especially influential variable but also that the importance of this variable diminished in the latter weeks of the outbreak. The latter finding is partly attributable to public health measures, particularly health screening in airports. The timing and geography of those measures are reviewed using data from media reports and interim World Health Organization (WHO) documents during the outbreak. The uneven effort to curtail the international diffusion of SARS suggests further planning is needed to develop a concerted response to contain future epidemics.},

  abstract        = {The well-known formula for the final size of an epidemic was published by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. Their analysis was based on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that assumes exponentially distributed infectious periods. More recent analyses have established that the standard final size formula is valid regardless of the distribution of infectious periods, but that it fails to be correct in the presence of certain kinds of heterogeneous mixing (e.g., if there is a core group, as for sexually transmitted diseases). We review previous work and establish more general conditions under which Kermack and McKendrick's formula is valid. We show that the final size formula is unchanged if there is a latent stage, any number of distinct infectious stages and/or a stage during which infectives are isolated (the durations of each stage can be drawn from any integrable distribution). We also consider the possibility that the transmission rates of infectious individuals are arbitrarily distributed--allowing, in particular, for the existence of super-spreaders--and prove that this potential complexity has no impact on the final size formula. Finally, we show that the final size formula is unchanged even for a general class of spatial contact structures. We conclude that whenever a new respiratory pathogen emerges, an estimate of the expected magnitude of the epidemic can be made as soon the basic reproduction number R0 can be approximated, and this estimate is likely to be improved only by more accurate estimates of R0, not by knowledge of any other epidemiological details.},

  abstract        = {Contact network epidemiology is an approach to modeling the spread of infectious diseases that explicitly considers patterns of person-to-person contacts within a community. Contacts can be asymmetric, with a person more likely to infect one of their contacts than to become infected by that contact. This is true for some sexually transmitted diseases that are more easily caught by women than men during heterosexual encounters; and for severe infectious diseases that cause an average person to seek medical attention and thereby potentially infect health care workers (HCWs) who would not, in turn, have an opportunity to infect that average person. Here we use methods from percolation theory to develop a mathematical framework for predicting disease transmission through semi-directed contact networks in which some contacts are undirected-the probability of transmission is symmetric between individuals-and others are directed-transmission is possible only in one direction. We find that the probability of an epidemic and the expected fraction of a population infected during an epidemic can be different in semi-directed networks, in contrast to the routine assumption that these two quantities are equal. We furthermore demonstrate that these methods more accurately predict the vulnerability of HCWs and the efficacy of various hospital-based containment strategies during outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases.},

Unlike the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed models of disease transmission, our model exhibits both geographically localised outbreaks and "super-spreaders". Moreover, the combination of localised and long range links allows for more accurate modelling of partial isolation and various public health policies. From this model, we derive an expression for the probability of a widespread outbreak and a condition to ensure that the epidemic is controlled. Moreover, multiple simulations are used to make predictions of the likelihood of various eventual scenarios for fixed initial conditions. The main conclusions of this study are: (i) "super-spreaders" may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant; (ii) consistent with previous reports, extended exposure time beyond 3-5 days (i.e. significant nosocomial transmission) was the key factor in the severity of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong; and, (iii) the spread of SARS can be effectively controlled by either limiting long range links (imposing a partial quarantine) or enforcing rapid hospitalisation and isolation of symptomatic individuals.},

The estimated transmission rate decreased dramatically from 20 to 30 April 2003. The total number of cases in the epidemic in Beijing was estimated to be 2521. Hierarchical clustering revealed that risk-exposures were widespread, but clustered in a pattern that is distinctly related to the Beijing urban ring roads. Traditional control measures can be very effective at reducing transmission of SARS. Spatial patterns of risk-exposures can inform disease surveillance, prediction and control by identifying spatial target areas on which interventions should be focused.},

  abstract        = {SARS and travel are intricately interlinked. Travelers belonged to those primarily affected in the early stages of the outbreak, travelers became vectors of the disease, and finally, travel and tourism themselves became the victims. The outbreak of SARS created international anxiety because of its novelty, its ease of transmission in certain settings, and the speed of its spread through jet travel, combined with extensive media coverage. The psychological impacts of SARS, coupled with travel restrictions imposed by various national and international authorities, have diminished international travel in 2003, far beyond the limitations to truly SARS hit areas. Governments and press, especially in non SARS affected areas, have been slow to strike the right balance between timely and frequent risk communication and placing risk in the proper context. Screening at airport entry points is costly, has a low yield and is not sufficient in itself. The low yield in detecting SARS is most likely due to a combination of factors, such as travel advisories which resulted in reduced travel to and from SARS affected areas, implementation of effective pre-departure screening at airports in SARS-hit countries, and a rapid decline in new cases at the time when screening was finally introduced. Rather than investing in airport screening measures to detect rare infectious diseases, investments should be used to strengthen screening and infection control capacities at points of entry into the healthcare system. If SARS reoccurs, the subsequent outbreak will be smaller and more easily contained if the lessons learnt from the recent epidemic are applied. Lessons learnt during the outbreak in relation to international travel will be discussed.},

These advances have put in evidence the limits of homogeneous assumptions and simple spatial diffusion approaches, and stimulated the inclusion of complex features and heterogeneities relevant in the description of epidemic diffusion. In this paper, we review recent progresses that integrate complex systems and networks analysis with epidemic modelling and focus on the impact of the various complex features of real systems on the dynamics of epidemic spreading.},

Results confirm that case isolation, and the tracing, vaccination and observation of case contacts can be optimal for control but only for optimistic assumptions concerning, for example, the basic reproduction number for smallpox (R0=3) and smaller numbers of index cases ( approximately 10). For a wider range of scenarios, including larger numbers of index cases and higher reproduction numbers, the addition of mass vaccination targeted only to infected districts provided an appreciable benefit (5-80% fewer deaths depending on where the outbreak started with a trigger value of 1-10 isolated symptomatic individuals within a district).},

  abstract        = {There is growing interest in understanding and controlling the spread of diseases through realistically structured host populations. We investigate how network structures, ranging from circulant, through small-world networks, to random networks, and vaccination strategy and effort interact to influence the proportion of the population infected, the size and timing of the epidemic peak, and the duration of the epidemic. We found these three factors, and their higher-order interactions, significantly influenced epidemic development and extent. Increasing vaccination effort (from 0% to 90%) decreased the number of hosts infected while increasing network randomness worked to increase disease spread. On average, vaccinating hosts based on degree (hubs) resulted in the smallest epidemics while vaccinating hosts with the highest clustering coefficient resulted in the largest epidemics. In a targeted test of five vaccination strategies on a small-world network (probability of rewiring edges=5%) with 10% vaccination effort we found that vaccinating hosts preferentially with high-clustering coefficients (similar to real-world strategies) resulted in twice the number of hosts infected as random vaccinations and nearly a 30-fold higher number of cases than our strategy targeting hubs (highest degree hosts). Our model suggests how vaccinations might be implemented to minimize the extent of an epidemic (e.g., duration and total number infected) as well as the timing and number of hosts infected at a given time over a wide range of structured host networks.},

  abstract        = {A multipatch model is proposed to study the impact of travel on the spatial spread of disease between patches with different level of disease prevalence. The basic reproduction number for the ith patch in isolation is obtained along with the basic reproduction number of the system of patches, Re(0). Inequalities describing the relationship between these numbers are also given. For a two-patch model with one high prevalence patch and one low prevalence patch, results pertaining to the dependence of Re(0) on the travel rates between the two patches are obtained. For parameter values relevant for influenza, these results show that, while banning travel of infectives from the low to the high prevalence patch always contributes to disease control, banning travel of symptomatic travelers only from the high to the low prevalence patch could adversely affect the containment of the outbreak under certain ranges of parameter values. Moreover, banning all travel of infected individuals from the high to the low prevalence patch could result in the low prevalence patch becoming diseasefree, while the high prevalence patch becomes even more disease-prevalent, with the resulting number of infectives in this patch alone exceeding the combined number of infectives in both patches without border control. Under the set of parameter values used, our results demonstrate that if border control is properly implemented, then it could contribute to stopping the spatial spread of disease between patches.},

However, even if we can construct the model as finely as possible, it cannot mimic the real world precisely. Therefore, we should use real data for transportation modes and locations, and simulate the diffusion of an infectious disease into that real data. In the present study, we obtained data on the transportation modes and locations of 0.88 million persons a day in the Tokyo metropolitan area. First, we defined the location of all individuals in the data set every 6 min. Second, we determined how many people they came in contact with in their household, in each area, and on the train, and then we assumed that a certain percentage of those contacted would become infected and transmit the disease. Data for natural history and other parameters were taken from previous research. The average number of contacts in each area was 51 748 (95% confidence intervals [CI],46 846-56 650]), at home it was 246 (95% CI, 232-260), and on the train it was 91 (95% CI, 81-101). The number of newly infected people was estimated to be 3032 on day 7 and 126 951 on day 10. The geographic diffusion on day 7, the day when the earliest response would have started, expanded to the whole of the Tokyo metropolitan area. We were able to realize the speed and geographic spread of infection with the highest reality. Therefore, we can use this model for making preparedness plans.},

Also, during the initial stages of an outbreak of a new or reemerging pathogen, disease incidence tends to occur in spatial clusters, which makes containment possible if you can predict the subsequent spread of disease. Spatial models are being used with increasing frequency to help characterize these large-scale patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions. Here, I review several recent studies on four diseases that show the benefits of different methodologies: measles (patch models), foot-and-mouth disease (distance-transmission models), pandemic influenza (multigroup models), and smallpox (network models). This review highlights the importance of the household in spatial studies of human diseases, such as smallpox and influenza. It also demonstrates the need to develop a simple model of household demographics, so that these large-scale models can be extended to the investigation of long-time scale human pathogens, such as tuberculosis and HIV.},

Circulation of viral pathogens within vaccinated populations may favour the development of vaccine resistance with implications for the evolution of virus pathogenicity and the emergence of variant viruses. The high rate of mutations during replication of ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses is conducive to the development of escape mutants. In vaccinated cattle, unusual mutations have been found in the major antigenic site of foot and mouth disease virus, which is also involved in receptor recognition. Likewise, atypical changes have been detected in the immunodominant region of bovine respiratory syncytial virus. Large deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses are able to recombine, generating new genotypes, as shown by the potential of glycoprotein E-negative vaccine strains of bovine herpesvirus-1 to recombine with wild-type strains. Marek's disease virus is often quoted as an example of vaccine-induced change in pathogenicity. The reasons for this increase in virulence have not been elucidated and possible explanations are discussed.},

The authors study the problem of allocating limited control resources (e.g. quarantine or recovery resources) in these networks in a way that exploits the topological structure, so as to maximise the speed at which the virus is eliminated. For both multi-group and contact-network models for spread, these problems can be abstracted to a particular decentralised control problem for which the goal is to minimise the dominant eigenvalue of a system matrix. Explicit solutions to these problems are provided, using eigenvalue sensitivity ideas together with constrained optimisation methods employing Lagrange multipliers. The proposed design method shows that the optimal strategy is to allocate resources so as to equalise the propagation impact of each network component, as best as possible within the constraints on the resource. Finally, we show that this decentralised control approach can provide significant advantage over a homogeneous control strategy, in the context of a model for SARS transmission in Hong Kong.},

The realisation in March 2003 that SARS was spreading led affected countries to introduce measures such as rapid dissemination of information, early case detection and isolation, tracing and quarantining of SARS contacts, traveller screening, raising public awareness of risk and institution of stricter infection control in health care settings. SARS became a notifiable disease in China in mid-April 2003, after which introduction of efficient nationwide control measures led to containment within 2 months. Countries differed in the timeliness of implementing control measures, the mode and extent to which these were enforced and in the resources available to do so. SARS challenged the political and public health systems of all affected countries. It demanded rapid and decisive action to be taken, yet the comparison shows how difficult this was for an unknown new disease. Guangdong reacted rapidly but this pace was not continued by China for some time, which facilitated national and international spread. Once the Chinese government changed its policy, it developed an impressive control strategy involving the public which culminated in containment. The significance of timely information was perhaps the main lesson which the SARS epidemic taught.},

Among the many dynamical processes involving networks, propagation processes-in which the final state can be obtained by studying the underlying network percolation properties-have raised formidable interest. In this paper, we present a bond percolation model of multitype networks with an arbitrary joint degree distribution that allows heterogeneity in the edge occupation probability. As previously demonstrated, the multitype approach allows many nontrivial mixing patterns such as assortativity and clustering between nodes. We derive a number of useful statistical properties of multitype networks as well as a general phase transition criterion. We also demonstrate that a number of previous models based on probability generating functions are special cases of the proposed formalism. We further show that the multitype approach, by naturally allowing heterogeneity in the bond occupation probability, overcomes some of the correlation issues encountered by previous models. We illustrate this point in the context of contact network epidemiology.},

Although there is some evidence of pre-existing immunity among older adults, this alone may not explain the significant gap in age-specific infection rates. Based on a retrospective analysis of pandemic strains of influenza from the last century, we show that school-age children typically experience the highest attack rates in primarily naive populations, with the burden shifting to adults during the subsequent season. Using a parsimonious network-based mathematical model which incorporates the changing distribution of contacts in the susceptible population, we demonstrate that new pandemic strains of influenza are expected to shift the epidemiological landscape in exactly this way. Our results provide a simple demographic explanation for the age bias observed for H1N1/09 attack rates, and a prediction that this bias will shift in coming months. These results also have significant implications for the allocation of public health resources including vaccine distribution policies.},

  abstract        = {Several countries plan to introduce non-contact infrared thermometers (NCIT) at international airports in order to detect febrile passengers, thus to delay the introduction of a novel influenza strain. We reviewed the existing studies on fever screening by NCIT to estimate their efficacy under the hypothesis of pandemic influenza. Three Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or dengue fever interventions in airports were excluded because of insufficient information. Six fever screening studies in other gathering areas, mainly hospitals, were included (N= 176 to 72,327 persons; fever prevalence= 1.2% to 16.9%). Sensitivity varied from 4.0% to 89.6%, specificity from 75.4% to 99.6%, positive predictive value (PPV) from 0.9% to 76.0% and negative predictive value (NPV) from 86.1% to 99.7%. When we fixed fever prevalence at 1% in all studies to allow comparisons, the derived PPV varied from 3.5% to 65.4% and NPV was >or=99%. The low PPV suggests limited efficacy of NCIT to detect symptomatic passengers at the early stages of a pandemic influenza, when fever prevalence among passengers would be =or<1%. External factors can also impair the screening strategy: passengers can hide their symptoms or cross borders before symptoms occur. These limits should be considered when setting up border control measures to delay the pandemic progression.},

In this bottom-up simulation approach, a landscape can be created and populated with a heterogeneous group of agents who move and interact in ways that more closely resemble human behavior than is usually seen in other modeling techniques. In this project, an agent-based model was constructed to simulate the spread of the 1918 influenza pandemic through the Norway House community in Manitoba, Canada. Archival, ethnographic, epidemiological, and biological information were used to aid in designing the structure of the model and to estimate values for model parameters. During the epidemic, Norway House was a Hudson's Bay Company post and a Swampy Cree-Métis settlement with an economy based on hunting, fishing, and the fur trade. The community followed a traditional, seasonal travel pattern of summer aggregation and winter dispersal. The model was used to examine how seasonal community structures and associated population movement patterns may have influenced disease transmission and epidemic spread. Simulations of the model clearly demonstrate that human behavior can significantly influence epidemic outcomes.},

Prior to the large-scale distribution of an effective vaccine, the primary modes of control have included careful surveillance, social distancing and hygiene measures, strategic school closures, other community measures, and the prudent use of antiviral medications to prevent infection (prophylaxis) or reduce the severity and duration of symptoms (treatment). Here, we use mathematical models to determine the optimal geo-temporal tactics for distributing the U.S. strategic national stockpile of antivirals for treatment of infected cases during the early stages of a pandemic, prior to the wide availability of vaccines.We present a versatile optimization method for efficiently searching large sets of public health intervention strategies, and apply it to evaluating tactics for distributing antiviral medications from the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). We implemented the algorithm on a network model of H1N1 transmission within and among U.S. cities to project the epidemiological impacts of antiviral stockpile distribution schedules and priorities. The resulting optimized strategies critically depend on the rates of antiviral uptake and wastage (through misallocation or loss). And while a surprisingly simple pro rata distribution schedule is competitive with the optimized strategies across a wide range of uptake and wastage, other equally simple policies perform poorly.Even as vaccination campaigns get underway worldwide, antiviral medications continue to play a critical in reducing H1N1-associated morbidity and mortality. If efforts are made to increase the fraction of cases treated promptly with antivirals above current levels, our model suggests that optimal use of the antiviral component of the Strategic National Stockpile may appreciably slow the transmission of H1N1 during fall 2009, thereby improving the impact of targeted vaccination. A more aggressive optimized antiviral strategy of this type may prove critical to mitigating future flu pandemics, but may increase the risk of antiviral resistance.},

Probable SARS cases occurring between November 2002 and May 2003 in mainland China were compiled from different sources and geo-coded into a geographical information database based on onset location. Spatial analyses including kernel density estimation, and spatial statistical and tracking analyses were performed to characterise the spatiotemporal distribution of SARS cases based on onset location/date. SARS cases that got infected in Beijing but were reported in three provinces surrounding Beijing were mapped, and logistic regression using a 'case-control' design at the county level was performed to analyse the impact of travel-related risk factors in the diffusion pattern. The SARS epidemic in mainland China spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas in Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region, Hebei Province and Tianjin. Counties in the neighbourhood of Beijing that were crossed by a national highway or inter-provincial freeway showed the highest risk of acquiring SARS infections, even after correction for population density and medical staff density. Being intersected by a railway did not significantly associate with risk of SARS. This study provides the first complete documentation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the SARS epidemic in mainland China. Our analyses confirmed that SARS had benefited from national highways and inter-provincial freeways for its spread from epicentres to neighbouring areas, whereas trains showed no significant association. This knowledge may be important for the control of re-emerging SARS, or other future emerging human-to-human transmittable infections.},

This is a significant issue in the realm of infection control because of the increased potential for the rapid worldwide transmission and spread of disease. Although the transmission of infectious diseases to airline passengers inside an aircraft is a rare occurrence, it is essential to implement entry and exit screening procedures at airports within the context of the International Health Regulations (IHR) in order to slow down the spread of infection, especially during the early phases of a pandemic event. Currently, there are no standardized procedures for health screening at airports, thus allowing individual regional authorities to determine what they deem to be appropriate screening measures for implementation. In this paper, we will discuss a new pragmatic approach for entry and exit screening procedures at international airports, propose a new classification system for contacts within the aircraft, and discuss changing the fixed enforcement of standardized community mitigation measures to the implementation of measures that correspond to specific characteristics of individual pathogenic agents. The proposed catalog of screening measures is aimed at attaining the goals of the IHR, which states that the measures should be reasonable while avoiding inconvenience or harm to passengers and should not be any more disruptive to the smooth handling of passenger traffic than is necessary.},

We developed a model to estimate the number of imported SARS cases between regions, using the 2003 SARS epidemic data to apply this model for two scenarios: from Beijing to Frankfurt and from Hong Kong to London. We back-calculated the data to estimate individuals' time of infection and built a model where every individual has a probability of being isolated, of traveling, and of being undetected at arrival. The findings, consistent with what was observed in 2003, suggest that entry screening does not affect the predicted number of imported cases. Inversely, importation depends on the transmission dynamic in the country of origin (including control measures in place) and on the intensity of air travel between regions.},

Most network-based studies of this spread focus on the impact of variations in degree (the number of contacts an individual has). However, other effects such as clustering, variations in infectiousness or susceptibility, or variations in closeness of contacts may play a significant role. We develop analytic techniques to predict how these effects alter the growth rate, probability and size of epidemics, and validate the predictions with a realistic social network. We find that (for a given degree distribution and average transmissibility) clustering is the dominant factor controlling the growth rate, heterogeneity in infectiousness is the dominant factor controlling the probability of an epidemic and heterogeneity in susceptibility is the dominant factor controlling the size of an epidemic. Edge weights (measuring closeness or duration of contacts) have impact only if correlations exist between different edges. Combined, these effects can play a minor role in reinforcing one another, with the impact of clustering the largest when the population is maximally heterogeneous or if the closer contacts are also strongly clustered. Our most significant contribution is a systematic way to address clustering in infectious disease models, and our results have a number of implications for the design of interventions.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical models of infectious diseases, which are in principle analytically tractable, use two general approaches. The first approach, generally known as compartmental modeling, addresses the time evolution of disease propagation at the expense of simplifying the pattern of transmission. The second approach uses network theory to incorporate detailed information pertaining to the underlying contact structure among individuals while disregarding the progression of time during outbreaks. So far, the only alternative that enables the integration of both aspects of disease propagation simultaneously while preserving the variety of outcomes has been to abandon the analytical approach and rely on computer simulations. We offer an analytical framework, that incorporates both the complexity of contact network structure and the time progression of disease spread. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework is equally effective on finite- and "infinite"-size networks. This formalism can be equally applied to similar percolation phenomena on networks in other areas of science and technology.},

  abstract        = {An influenza pandemic--an outbreak of a novel influenza virus that spreads around the world--is a real threat. To predict the spread of an influenza pandemic across the whole of Japan, this study applies a real individual-based model (ribm) to the whole of Japan and simulates how a single case of influenza could spark pandemic influenza throughout Japan. We used Person-Trip (PT) data for nine regions (the Tokyo metropolitan area, Kansai, Chukyo, Fukuoka, Sendai, Sapporo, Miyazaki, Okinawa, and northern Ibaragi). PT data were collected from randomly chosen persons and contain information on their locations and their uses of all transportation modes including trains, cars, buses, bicycles, and walking. In total, the nine regions have a population of about 72 million, of whom more than 2.20 million individuals participated in the PT surveys. Estimates on the probability of movement among the nine PT regions are based on the results of the Third National Survey for Movement in 2003. Disease transmission in each region or on a train is assumed to occur within a 1-m radius. The approximate numbers of new cases arising on day 14 after the arrival of the first infected person are estimated to be 322,000 in Tokyo, 25,000 in Kansai, 4,800 in Chukyo, 3,600 in Sapporo, 2,600 in Fukuoka, 600 in Sendai, 17 in Okinawa, and 300 in Miyazaki. The disease seems to spread more slowly in smaller cities such as Miyazaki and Okinawa than in big cities such as Tokyo and Kansai. Area quarantines may help to contain outbreaks in smaller cities, but probably not in larger cities. Because this study demonstrates that ribm is useful for simulating the spread of pandemic influenza in Japan, it is hoped that this modeling technique will be used in the creation of preparedness plans.},

  abstract        = {The propagation of communicable diseases through a population is an inherent spatial and temporal process of great importance for modern society. For this reason a spatially explicit epidemiologic model of infectious disease is proposed for a greater understanding of the disease's spatial diffusion through a network of human contacts. The objective of this study is to develop an agent-based modelling approach the integrates geographic information systems (GIS) to simulate the spread of a communicable disease in an urban environment, as a result of individuals' interactions in a geospatial context. The methodology for simulating spatiotemporal dynamics of communicable disease propagation is presented and the model is implemented using measles outbreak in an urban environment as a case study. Individuals in a closed population are explicitly represented by agents associated to places where they interact with other agents. They are endowed with mobility, through a transportation network allowing them to move between places within the urban environment, in order to represent the spatial heterogeneity and the complexity involved in infectious diseases diffusion. The model is implemented on georeferenced land use dataset from Metro Vancouver and makes use of census data sets from Statistics Canada for the municipality of Burnaby, BC, Canada study site. The results provide insights into the application of the model to calculate ratios of susceptible/infected in specific time frames and urban environments, due to its ability to depict the disease progression based on individuals' interactions. It is demonstrated that the dynamic spatial interactions within the population lead to high numbers of exposed individuals who perform stationary activities in areas after they have finished commuting. As a result, the sick individuals are concentrated in geographical locations like schools and universities. The GIS-agent based model designed for this study can be easily customized to study the disease spread dynamics of any other communicable disease by simply adjusting the modeled disease timeline and/or the infection model and modifying the transmission process. This type of simulations can help to improve comprehension of disease spread dynamics and to take better steps towards the prevention and control of an epidemic outbreak.},

  abstract        = {Between 5 and 25 April 2009, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 caused a substantial, severe outbreak in Mexico, and subsequently developed into the first global pandemic in 41 years. We determined the reproduction number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by analyzing the dynamics of the complete case series in Mexico City during this early period. We analyzed three mutually exclusive datasets from Mexico City Distrito Federal which constituted all suspect cases from 15 March to 25 April: confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections, non-pandemic influenza A infections and patients who tested negative for influenza. We estimated the initial reproduction number from 497 suspect cases identified prior to 20 April, using a novel contact network methodology incorporating dates of symptom onset and hospitalization, variation in contact rates, extrinsic sociological factors, and uncertainties in underreporting and disease progression. We tested the robustness of this estimate using both the subset of laboratory-confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections and an extended case series through 25 April, adjusted for suspected ascertainment bias. The initial reproduction number (95% confidence interval range) for this novel virus is 1.51 (1.32-1.71) based on suspected cases and 1.43 (1.29-1.57) based on confirmed cases before 20 April. The longer time series (through 25 April) yielded a higher estimate of 2.04 (1.84-2.25), which reduced to 1.44 (1.38-1.51) after correction for ascertainment bias. The estimated transmission characteristics of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 suggest that pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures may appreciably limit its spread prior the development of an effective vaccine.},

  abstract        = {In recent years large-scale computational models for the realistic simulation of epidemic outbreaks have been used with increased frequency. Methodologies adapt to the scale of interest and range from very detailed agent-based models to spatially-structured metapopulation models. One major issue thus concerns to what extent the geotemporal spreading pattern found by different modeling approaches may differ and depend on the different approximations and assumptions used. We provide for the first time a side-by-side comparison of the results obtained with a stochastic agent-based model and a structured metapopulation stochastic model for the progression of a baseline pandemic event in Italy, a large and geographically heterogeneous European country. The agent-based model is based on the explicit representation of the Italian population through highly detailed data on the socio-demographic structure. The metapopulation simulations use the GLobal Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) model, based on high-resolution census data worldwide, and integrating airline travel flow data with short-range human mobility patterns at the global scale. The model also considers age structure data for Italy. GLEaM and the agent-based models are synchronized in their initial conditions by using the same disease parameterization, and by defining the same importation of infected cases from international travels. The results obtained show that both models provide epidemic patterns that are in very good agreement at the granularity levels accessible by both approaches, with differences in peak timing on the order of a few days. The relative difference of the epidemic size depends on the basic reproductive ratio, R0, and on the fact that the metapopulation model consistently yields a larger incidence than the agent-based model, as expected due to the differences in the structure in the intra-population contact pattern of the approaches. The age breakdown analysis shows that similar attack rates are obtained for the younger age classes. The good agreement between the two modeling approaches is very important for defining the tradeoff between data availability and the information provided by the models. The results we present define the possibility of hybrid models combining the agent-based and the metapopulation approaches according to the available data and computational resources.},

  abstract        = {As Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza spreads around the globe, it strikes school-age children more often than adults. Although there is some evidence of pre-existing immunity among older adults, this alone may not explain the significant gap in age-specific infection rates. Based on a retrospective analysis of pandemic strains of influenza from the last century, we show that school-age children typically experience the highest attack rates in primarily naive populations, with the burden shifting to adults during the subsequent season. Using a parsimonious network-based mathematical model which incorporates the changing distribution of contacts in the susceptible population, we demonstrate that new pandemic strains of influenza are expected to shift the epidemiological landscape in exactly this way. Our analysis provides a simple demographic explanation for the age bias observed for H1N1/09 attack rates, and suggests that this bias may shift in coming months. These results have significant implications for the allocation of public health resources for H1N1/09 and future influenza pandemics.},

This paper presents an empirical spatio-temporal analysis of epidemiological data concerning 2321 SARS-infected patients in Beijing in 2003. We mapped the SARS morbidity data with the spatial data resolution at the level of street and township. Two smoothing methods, Bayesian adjustment and spatial smoothing, were applied to identify the spatial risks and spatial transmission trends. Furthermore, we explored various spatial patterns and spatio-temporal evolution of Beijing 2003 SARS epidemic using spatial statistics such as Moran's I and LISA. Part of this study is targeted at evaluating the effectiveness of public health control measures implemented during the SARS epidemic. The main findings are as follows. (1) The diffusion speed of SARS in the northwest-southeast direction is weaker than that in northeast-southwest direction. (2) SARS's spread risk is positively spatially associated and the strength of this spatial association has experienced changes from weak to strong and then back to weak during the lifetime of the Beijing SARS epidemic. (3) Two spatial clusters of disease cases are identified: one in the city center and the other in the eastern suburban area. These two clusters followed different evolutionary paths but interacted with each other as well. (4) Although the government missed the opportunity to contain the early outbreak of SARS in March 2003, the response strategies implemented after the mid of April were effective. These response measures not only controlled the growth of the disease cases, but also mitigated the spatial diffusion.},

  abstract        = {Knowledge of social contact patterns still represents the most critical step for understanding the spread of directly transmitted infections. Data on social contact patterns are, however, expensive to obtain. A major issue is then whether the simulation of synthetic societies might be helpful to reliably reconstruct such data. In this paper, we compute a variety of synthetic age-specific contact matrices through simulation of a simple individual-based model (IBM). The model is informed by Italian Time Use data and routine socio-demographic data (e.g., school and workplace attendance, household structure, etc.). The model is named "Little Italy" because each artificial agent is a clone of a real person. In other words, each agent's daily diary is the one observed in a corresponding real individual sampled in the Italian Time Use Survey. We also generated contact matrices from the socio-demographic model underlying the Italian IBM for pandemic prediction. These synthetic matrices are then validated against recently collected Italian serological data for Varicella (VZV) and ParvoVirus (B19). Their performance in fitting sero-profiles are compared with other matrices available for Italy, such as the Polymod matrix. Synthetic matrices show the same qualitative features of the ones estimated from sample surveys: for example, strong assortativeness and the presence of super- and sub-diagonal stripes related to contacts between parents and children. Once validated against serological data, Little Italy matrices fit worse than the Polymod one for VZV, but better than concurrent matrices for B19. This is the first occasion where synthetic contact matrices are systematically compared with real ones, and validated against epidemiological data. The results suggest that simple, carefully designed, synthetic matrices can provide a fruitful complementary approach to questionnaire-based matrices. The paper also supports the idea that, depending on the transmissibility level of the infection, either the number of different contacts, or repeated exposure, may be the key factor for transmission.},

  abstract        = {Better understanding the possible effects of vaccinating employees is important and can help policymakers and businesses plan vaccine distribution and administration logistics, especially with the current H1N1 influenza vaccine in short supply. This article aims to determine the effects of varying vaccine coverage, compliance, administration rates, prioritization, and timing among employees during an influenza pandemic. As part of the H1N1 influenza planning efforts of the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study network, an agent-based computer simulation model was developed for the Washington DC metropolitan region, encompassing five metropolitan statistical areas. Each simulation run involved introducing 100 infectious individuals to initiate a 1.3 reproductive-rate (R(0)) epidemic, consistent with H1N1 parameters to date. Another set of scenarios represented a R(0)=1.6 epidemic. An unmitigated epidemic resulted in substantial productivity losses (a mean of $112.6 million for a serologic 15% attack rate and $193.8 million for a serologic 25% attack rate), even with the relatively low estimated mortality impact of H1N1. Although vaccinating Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-defined priority groups resulted in the largest savings, vaccinating all remaining workers captured additional savings and, in fact, reduced healthcare workers' and critical infrastructure workers' chances of infection. Moreover, although employee vaccination compliance affected the epidemic, once 20% compliance was achieved, additional increases in compliance provided less incremental benefit. Even though a vast majority of the workplaces in the DC metropolitan region had fewer than 100 employees, focusing on vaccinating only those in larger firms (> or =100 employees) was just as effective in mitigating the epidemic as trying to vaccinate employees in all workplaces. Timely vaccination of at least 20% of the large-company workforce can play an important role in epidemic mitigation.},

The presented method solves an inverse problem to discover the effectively decisive topology of a heterogeneous network and reveal the transmission parameters which govern the stochastic spreads over the network from a dataset on an infectious disease outbreak in the early growth phase. Populations in a combination of epidemiological compartment models and a meta-population network model are described by stochastic differential equations. Probability density functions are derived from the equations and used for the maximal likelihood estimation of the topology and parameters.

We established a network of GPFDs in Singapore. Participating GPFDs submitted returns via facsimile or e-mail on their work days using a simple, standard data collection format, capturing: gender; year of birth; "ethnicity"; residential status; body temperature (degrees C); and treatment (antiviral or not); for all cases with a clinical diagnosis of an acute respiratory illness (ARI). The operational definition of ILI in this study was an ARI with fever of 37.8 degrees C or more. The data were processed daily by the study co-ordinator and fed into a stochastic model of disease dynamics, which was refitted daily using particle filtering, with data and forecasts uploaded to a website which could be publicly accessed. Twenty-three GPFD clinics agreed to participate. Data collection started on 2009-06-26 and lasted for the duration of the epidemic. The epidemic appeared to have peaked around 2009-08-03 and the ILI rates had returned to baseline levels by the time of writing. This real-time surveillance system is able to show the progress of an epidemic and indicates when the peak is reached. The resulting information can be used to form forecasts, including how soon the epidemic wave will end and when a second wave will appear if at all.},

  abstract        = {Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, especially those of a global nature, require rapid epidemiological analysis and information dissemination. The final products of those activities usually comprise internal memoranda and briefs within public health authorities and original research published in peer-reviewed journals. Using the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic as an example, we conducted a comprehensive time-stratified review of the published literature to describe the different types of epidemiological outputs. We identified and analyzed all published articles on the epidemiology of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong or Toronto. The analysis was stratified by study design, research domain, data collection, and analytical technique. We compared the SARS-case and matched-control non-SARS articles published according to the timeline of submission, acceptance, and publication. The impact factors of the publishing journals were examined according to the time of publication of SARS articles, and the numbers of citations received by SARS-case and matched-control articles submitted during and after the epidemic were compared. Descriptive, analytical, theoretical, and experimental epidemiology concerned, respectively, 54%, 30%, 11%, and 6% of the studies. Only 22% of the studies were submitted, 8% accepted, and 7% published during the epidemic. The submission-to-acceptance and acceptance-to-publication intervals of the SARS articles submitted during the epidemic period were significantly shorter than the corresponding intervals of matched-control non-SARS articles published in the same journal issues (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). The differences of median submission-to-acceptance intervals and median acceptance-to-publication intervals between SARS articles and their corresponding control articles were 106.5 d (95% confidence interval [CI] 55.0-140.1) and 63.5 d (95% CI 18.0-94.1), respectively. The median numbers of citations of the SARS articles submitted during the epidemic and over the 2 y thereafter were 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 8.0-52.0) and 8 (IQR 3.2-21.8), respectively, significantly higher than the median numbers of control article citations (15, IQR 8.5-16.5, p<0.05, and 7, IQR 3.0-12.0, p<0.01, respectively). A majority of the epidemiological articles on SARS were submitted after the epidemic had ended, although the corresponding studies had relevance to public health authorities during the epidemic. To minimize the lag between research and the exigency of public health practice in the future, researchers should consider adopting common, predefined protocols and ready-to-use instruments to improve timeliness, and thus, relevance, in addition to standardizing comparability across studies. To facilitate information dissemination, journal managers should reengineer their fast-track channels, which should be adapted to the purpose of an emerging outbreak, taking into account the requirement of high standards of quality for scientific journals and competition with other online resources.},

  abstract        = {Human influenza is characterized by seasonal epidemics, caused by rapid viral adaptation to population immunity. Vaccination against influenza must be updated annually, following surveillance of newly appearing viral strains. During an influenza season, several strains may be co-circulating, which will influence their individual evolution; furthermore, selective forces acting on the strains will be mediated by the transmission dynamics in the population. Clearly, viral evolution and public health policy are strongly interconnected. Understanding population-level dynamics of coexisting viral influenza infections, would be of great benefit in designing vaccination strategies. We use a Markov network to extend a previous homogeneous model of two co-circulating influenza viral strains by including vaccination (either prior to or during an outbreak), age structure, and heterogeneity of the contact network. We explore the effects of changes in vaccination rate, cross-immunity, and delay in appearance of the second strain, on the size and timing of infection peaks, attack rates, and disease-induced mortality rate; and compare the outcomes of the network and corresponding homogeneous models. Pre-vaccination is more effective than vaccination during an outbreak, resulting in lower attack rates for the first strain but higher attack rates for the second strain, until a "threshold" vaccination level of ~30-40% is reached, after which attack rates due to both strains sharply dropped. A small increase in mortality was found for increasing pre-vaccination coverage below about 40%, due to increasing numbers of strain 2 infections. The amount of cross-immunity present determines whether a second wave of infection will occur. Some significant differences were found between the homogeneous and network models, including timing and height of peak infection(s). Contact and age structure significantly influence the propagation of disease in the population. The present model explores only qualitative behaviour, based on parameters derived for homogeneous influenza models, but may be used for realistic populations through statistical estimates of inter-age contact patterns. This could have significant implications for vaccination strategies in realistic models of populations in which more than one strain is circulating.},

We performed time-series analyses and field investigations in the main affected areas. Results showed that cholera greatly increased during El Nino warm events (abnormally warm El Ninos) but decreased or remained stable between these events. Most epidemics occurred in a few hotspots in lakeside areas, where the weekly incidence of cholera varied by season, rainfall, fluctuations of plankton, and fishing activities. During lull periods, persistence of cholera was explained by outbreak dynamics, which suggested a metapopulation pattern, and by endemic foci around the lakes. These links between cholera outbreaks, climate, and lake environments need additional, multidisciplinary study.},

  abstract        = {Mexico's local and national authorities initiated an intense public health response during the early stages of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. In this study we analyzed the epidemiological patterns of the pandemic during April-December 2009 in Mexico and evaluated the impact of nonmedical interventions, school cycles, and demographic factors on influenza transmission. We used influenza surveillance data compiled by the Mexican Institute for Social Security, representing 40% of the population, to study patterns in influenza-like illness (ILIs) hospitalizations, deaths, and case-fatality rate by pandemic wave and geographical region. We also estimated the reproduction number (R) on the basis of the growth rate of daily cases, and used a transmission model to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies initiated during the spring pandemic wave. A total of 117,626 ILI cases were identified during April-December 2009, of which 30.6% were tested for influenza, and 23.3% were positive for the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic virus. A three-wave pandemic profile was identified, with an initial wave in April-May (Mexico City area), a second wave in June-July (southeastern states), and a geographically widespread third wave in August-December. The median age of laboratory confirmed ILI cases was ∼ 18 years overall and increased to ∼ 31 years during autumn (p<0.0001). The case-fatality ratio among ILI cases was 1.2% overall, and highest (5.5%) among people over 60 years. The regional R estimates were 1.8-2.1, 1.6-1.9, and 1.2-1.3 for the spring, summer, and fall waves, respectively. We estimate that the 18-day period of mandatory school closures and other social distancing measures implemented in the greater Mexico City area was associated with a 29%-37% reduction in influenza transmission in spring 2009. In addition, an increase in R was observed in late May and early June in the southeast states, after mandatory school suspension resumed and before summer vacation started. State-specific fall pandemic waves began 2-5 weeks after school reopened for the fall term, coinciding with an age shift in influenza cases. We documented three spatially heterogeneous waves of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic virus in Mexico, which were characterized by a relatively young age distribution of cases. Our study highlights the importance of school cycles on the transmission dynamics of this pandemic influenza strain and suggests that school closure and other mitigation measures could be useful to mitigate future influenza pandemics.

  abstract        = {Much remains unknown about the effect of timing and prioritization of vaccination against pandemic (pH1N1) 2009 virus on health outcomes. We adapted a city-level contact network model to study different campaigns on influenza morbidity and mortality. We modeled different distribution strategies initiated between July and November 2009 using a compartmental epidemic model that includes age structure and transmission network dynamics. The model represents the Greater Vancouver Regional District, a major North American city and surrounding suburbs with a population of 2 million, and is parameterized using data from the British Columbia Ministry of Health, published studies, and expert opinion. Outcomes are expressed as the number of infections and deaths averted due to vaccination. The model output was consistent with provincial surveillance data. Assuming a basic reproduction number = 1.4, an 8-week vaccination campaign initiated 2 weeks before the epidemic onset reduced morbidity and mortality by 79-91% and 80-87%, respectively, compared to no vaccination. Prioritizing children and parents for vaccination may have reduced transmission compared to actual practice, but the mortality benefit of this strategy appears highly sensitive to campaign timing. Modeling the actual late October start date resulted in modest reductions in morbidity and mortality (13-25% and 16-20%, respectively) with little variation by prioritization scheme. Delays in vaccine production due to technological or logistical barriers may reduce potential benefits of vaccination for pandemic influenza, and these temporal effects can outweigh any additional theoretical benefits from population targeting. Careful modeling may provide decision makers with estimates of these effects before the epidemic peak to guide production goals and inform policy. Integration of real-time surveillance data with mathematical models holds the promise of enabling public health planners to optimize the community benefits from proposed interventions before the pandemic peak.},

  abstract        = {In 2009, public health agencies across the globe worked to mitigate the impact of the swine-origin influenza A (pH1N1) virus. These efforts included intensified surveillance, social distancing, hygiene measures, and the targeted use of antiviral medications to prevent infection (prophylaxis). In addition, aggressive antiviral treatment was recommended for certain patient subgroups to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. To assist States and other localities meet these needs, the U.S. Government distributed a quarter of the antiviral medications in the Strategic National Stockpile within weeks of the pandemic's start. However, there are no quantitative models guiding the geo-temporal distribution of the remainder of the Stockpile in relation to pandemic spread or severity. We present a tactical optimization model for distributing this stockpile for treatment of infected cases during the early stages of a pandemic like 2009 pH1N1, prior to the wide availability of a strain-specific vaccine. Our optimization method efficiently searches large sets of intervention strategies applied to a stochastic network model of pandemic influenza transmission within and among U.S. cities. The resulting optimized strategies depend on the transmissability of the virus and postulated rates of antiviral uptake and wastage (through misallocation or loss). Our results suggest that an aggressive community-based antiviral treatment strategy involving early, widespread, pro-rata distribution of antivirals to States can contribute to slowing the transmission of mildly transmissible strains, like pH1N1. For more highly transmissible strains, outcomes of antiviral use are more heavily impacted by choice of distribution intervals, quantities per shipment, and timing of shipments in relation to pandemic spread. This study supports previous modeling results suggesting that appropriate antiviral treatment may be an effective mitigation strategy during the early stages of future influenza pandemics, increasing the need for systematic efforts to optimize distribution strategies and provide tactical guidance for public health policy-makers.},

  abstract        = {This paper explores methods for describing the dynamics of early epidemic spread and the clustering of infected cases in space and time when an underlying contact network structure is influencing disease spread. A novel method of describing an epidemic is presented that applies social network analysis to characterise the importance of both spatial location and contact network position. This method enables the development of a model of how these clusters formed, incorporating spatial clustering and contact network topology. Based on data from the first 30 days of the 2007 equine influenza outbreak in Australia, clusters of infected premises (IPs) were identified and delineated using social network analysis to integrate contact-tracing and spatial relationships. Clusters identified by this approach were compared to those detected using the space-time scan statistic to analyse the same data. To further investigate the importance of network and spatial location in epidemic spread, kriging by date of onset of clinical signs was used to model the spatio-temporal spread without reference to underlying contact network structure. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to derive a summary estimate of the accuracy of the kriged surface. Observations poorly explained by the kriged surface were identified, and their position within the contact network was explored to determine if they could be better explained through analysis of the underlying contact network. The contact network was found to lie at the core of a combined network model of spread, with infected horse movements connecting spatial clusters of infected premises. Kriging was imprecise in describing the pattern of spread during this early phase of the outbreak (explaining only 13% of the variation in date of onset of IPs), because early dissemination was dominated by network-based spread. Combined analysis of spatial and contact network data demonstrated that over the first 30 days of this outbreak local spread emanated outwards from the small number of infected premises in the contact network, up to a distance of around 15km. Consequently, when a contact network structure underlies epidemic spread, we recommend applying a method of spatial analysis that incorporates the network component of disease spread. Linking the spatial and network analysis of epidemics facilitates inference of the methods of disease transmission, providing a description of the sequence of spatial cluster formation.},

  abstract     = {As the viral diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Influenza A (H1N1) occur in many countries recently, the epidemic of those influenza viruses causes many human casualties. Moreover, the second infection from infected patients particularly within general hospitals frequently takes places due to improperly hospitalized and/or quarantined patients. Accordingly, it becomes a great concern to accommodate safer ventilation system in general hospital wards against such airborne transmitted viruses. It is also a recent trend that many urban general hospitals are designed and constructed as high-rises. If a virus is transmitted through uncontrolled air movement within a hospital and then infected other patients or healthy visitors, it might be impossible to control the spread of the disease. Thus research has been preceded scrutinizing stack effect on the indoor airborne virus transmission in large hospitals by conducting both the field measurement and numerical analysis according to the outdoor temperature and the releasing vertical points of the tracer gas assumed as a viral contaminant. In the field measurement of a high-rise hospital, the indoor airflow was affected by the stack effect of vertical chute of the building. The numerical simulation was verified by comparing its prediction results and the field measurement data. In result, very high possibility has witnessed that the airborne contaminant emitted from the infected patients in the lower floors could be transported to the higher floors through the airflow driven by the stack effect.},

The basic reproduction number is computed and proved to be a threshold for disease control. If it is not greater than the unity, the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. And there exists an endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable if the reproduction number is greater than unity. It is shown that the disease is endemic in the sense of permanence if and only if the endemic equilibrium exists. Exit screening and entry screening are shown to be helpful for disease eradication since they can always have the possibility to eradicate the disease endemic led by transport-related infection and furthermore have the possibility to eradicate disease even when the isolated cites are disease endemic.},

Although explicit spatial modeling is made possible by widespread data mapping of hydrology, transportation infrastructure, population distribution, and sanitation, the precise condition under which a waterborne disease epidemic can start in a spatially explicit setting is still lacking. Here we show that the requirement that all the local reproduction numbers R0 be larger than unity is neither necessary nor sufficient for outbreaks to occur when local settlements are connected by networks of primary and secondary infection mechanisms. To determine onset conditions, we derive general analytical expressions for a reproduction matrix G0, explicitly accounting for spatial distributions of human settlements and pathogen transmission via hydrological and human mobility networks. At disease onset, a generalized reproduction number Λ0 (the dominant eigenvalue of G0) must be larger than unity. We also show that geographical outbreak patterns in complex environments are linked to the dominant eigenvector and to spectral properties of G0. Tests against data and computations for the 2010 Haiti and 2000 KwaZulu-Natal cholera outbreaks, as well as against computations for metapopulation networks, demonstrate that eigenvectors of G0 provide a synthetic and effective tool for predicting the disease course in space and time. Networked connectivity models, describing the interplay between hydrology, epidemiology, and social behavior sustaining human mobility, thus prove to be key tools for emergency management of waterborne infections.},

We used a mote-based sensor network to record contacts among healthcare workers and patients in a 20-bed intensive care unit. The data collected from this network form the basis for an agent-based simulation to model the spread of nosocomial pathogens with various transmission probabilities. We identified the most- and least-connected healthcare workers. We then compared the effects of hand hygiene noncompliance as a function of connectedness. The data confirm the presence of peripatetic healthcare workers. Also, agent-based simulations using our real contact network data confirm that the average number of infected patients was significantly higher when the most connected healthcare worker did not practice hand hygiene and significantly lower when the least connected healthcare workers were noncompliant. Heterogeneity in healthcare worker contact patterns dramatically affects disease diffusion. Our findings should inform future infection control interventions and encourage the application of social network analysis to study disease transmission in healthcare settings.},

Approximately 44.9% (95%CI: 35.73-54.13%) of the confirmed imported dengue cases with an apparent symptom (febrile) in the viremic stage were detected via the airport fever screening program, with an estimated positive predictive value of 2.36% (95% CI: 0.96- 3.75%) and a negative predictive value > 99.99%. Fluctuations in the number of the symptomatic imported dengue cases identified in the airports (X) were associated with the total number of imported dengue cases (Y) based on a regression analysis of a biweekly surveillance (i.e., n = 104, R(2)(X:Y) = 0.61, P < 0.005). Additionally, the fluctuating patterns in the cumulative numbers of the imported dengue cases (X) with a 1-2 month lead time (t) was in parallel with that of the domestic dengue cases (Y) based on a consecutive 4-year surveillance (i.e., n = 48, R(2)(X(t-1):Y) = 0.22, R(2)(X(t-2):Y) = 0.31, P < 0.001) from 2007-2010. A moderate sensitivity of detecting dengue at the airports examined in this study indicated some limitations of the fever screening program for the prevention of importation. The screening program could assist in the rapid triage for self-quarantine of some symptomatic dengue cases that were in the viremic stage at the borders and contribute to active sentinel surveillance; however, the blocking of viral transmission to susceptible populations (neighbors or family) from all of the viremic travelers, including those with or without symptoms, is critical to prevent dengue epidemics. Therefore, the reinforcement of mosquito bite prevention and household vector control in dengue-endemic or dengue-competent hotspots during an epidemic season is essential and highly recommended.},

  abstract        = {Individual-based epidemiology models are increasingly used in the study of influenza epidemics. Several studies on influenza dynamics and evaluation of intervention measures have used the same incubation and infectious period distribution parameters based on the natural history of influenza. A sensitivity analysis evaluating the influence of slight changes to these parameters (in addition to the transmissibility) would be useful for future studies and real-time modeling during an influenza pandemic.In this study, we examined individual and joint effects of parameters and ranked parameters based on their influence on the dynamics of simulated epidemics. We also compared the sensitivity of the model across synthetic social networks for Montgomery County in Virginia and New York City (and surrounding metropolitan regions) with demographic and rural-urban differences. In addition, we studied the effects of changing the mean infectious period on age-specific epidemics. The research was performed from a public health standpoint using three relevant measures: time to peak, peak infected proportion and total attack rate. We also used statistical methods in the design and analysis of the experiments. The results showed that: (i) minute changes in the transmissibility and mean infectious period significantly influenced the attack rate; (ii) the mean of the incubation period distribution appeared to be sufficient for determining its effects on the dynamics of epidemics; (iii) the infectious period distribution had the strongest influence on the structure of the epidemic curves; (iv) the sensitivity of the individual-based model was consistent across social networks investigated in this study and (v) age-specific epidemics were sensitive to changes in the mean infectious period irrespective of the susceptibility of the other age groups. These findings suggest that small changes in some of the disease model parameters can significantly influence the uncertainty observed in real-time forecasting and predicting of the characteristics of an epidemic.},

The SAR has traditionally been approximated by a power law, but recent theories predict a triphasic SAR in logarithmic space, characterized by steeper increases in species richness at both small and large spatial scales. Here we uncover such universally upward accelerating SARs for amphibians, birds and mammals across the world’s major landmasses. Although apparently taxon-specific and continent-specific, all curves collapse into one universal function after the area is rescaled by using the mean range sizes of taxa within continents. In addition, all EARs approximately follow a power law with a slope close to 1, indicating that for most spatial scales there is roughly proportional species extinction with area loss. These patterns can be predicted by a simulation model based on the random placement of contiguous ranges within a domain. The universality of SARs and EARs after rescaling implies that both total and endemic species richness within an area, and also their rate of change with area, can be estimated by using only the knowledge of mean geographic range size in the region and mean species richness at one spatial scale.},

  abstract        = {Personal experiences with past infection events, or perceived vaccine failures and complications, are known to drive vaccine uptake. We coupled a model of individual vaccinating decisions, influenced by these drivers, with a contact network model of influenza transmission dynamics. The impact of non-influenzal influenza-like illness (niILI) on decision-making was also incorporated: it was possible for individuals to mistake niILI for true influenza. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the impact of personal experiences on vaccine coverage; (2) understand the impact of niILI on behaviour-incidence dynamics; (3) determine which factors influence vaccine coverage stability; and (4) determine whether vaccination strategies can become correlated on the network in the absence of social influence. We found that certain aspects of personal experience can significantly impact behaviour-incidence dynamics. For instance, longer term memory for past events had a strong stabilising effect on vaccine coverage dynamics, although it could either increase or decrease average vaccine coverage depending on whether memory of past infections or past vaccine failures dominated. When vaccine immunity wanes slowly, vaccine coverage is low and stable, and infection incidence is also very low, unless the effects of niILI are ignored. Strategy correlations can occur in the absence of imitation, on account of the neighbour-neighbour transmission of infection and history-dependent decision making. Finally, niILI weakens the behaviour-incidence coupling and therefore tends to stabilise dynamics, as well as breaking up strategy correlations. Behavioural feedbacks, and the quality of self-diagnosis of niILI, may need to be considered in future programs adopting "universal" flu vaccines conferring long-term immunity. Public health interventions that focus on reminding individuals about their previous influenza infections, as well as communicating facts about vaccine efficacy and the difference between influenza and niILI, may be an effective way to increase vaccine coverage and prevent unexpected drops in coverage.},

  abstract        = {Confirmed H1N1 cases during late spring and summer 2009 in various countries showed a substantial age shift between importations and local transmission cases, with adults mainly responsible for seeding unaffected regions and children most frequently driving community outbreaks. We introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model with two age classes to analytically investigate the role of a heterogeneously mixing population and its associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors on the risk of a major epidemic. We inform the model with demographic data, contact data and travel statistics of Europe and Mexico, and calibrate it to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic early outbreak. We allow for variations of the model parameters to explore the conditions of invasion under different scenarios. We derive the expression for the potential of global invasion of the epidemic that depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the transportation network and mobility features, the demographic profile and the mixing pattern. Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demographic profile and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Model results are compatible with the H1N1 spatial transmission dynamics observed. This work illustrates the importance of considering age-dependent mixing profiles and mobility features coupled together to study the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging influenza pandemic. Its results allow the immediate assessment of the risk of a major epidemic for a specific scenario upon availability of data, and the evaluation of the potential effectiveness of public health interventions targeting specific age groups, their interactions and mobility behaviors. The approach provides a general modeling framework that can be used for other types of partitions of the host population and applied to different settings.},

These spatial models are individual-level models which account for the spatio-temporal dynamics of infectious disease. The focus here is on choosing a spatial model which best predicts the true probabilities of infection, as well as determining under which conditions such spatial models fail. Spatial models tend to predict infection probability reasonably well when disease spread is propagated through contact networks in which contacts are only within a certain distance of each other. If contacts exist over long distances, the spatial models tend to perform worse when compared to the network model.},

The combined multiscale nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the underlying networks make it difficult to develop an intuitive understanding of these processes, to distinguish relevant from peripheral factors, to predict their time course, and to locate their origin. However, we show that complex spatiotemporal patterns can be reduced to surprisingly simple, homogeneous wave propagation patterns, if conventional geographic distance is replaced by a probabilistically motivated effective distance. In the context of global, air-traffic-mediated epidemics, we show that effective distance reliably predicts disease arrival times. Even if epidemiological parameters are unknown, the method can still deliver relative arrival times. The approach can also identify the spatial origin of spreading processes and successfully be applied to data of the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and 2003 SARS epidemic.},

  abstract        = {When novel disease outbreaks occur in livestock, policy makers must respond promptly to eliminate disease, and are typically called on to make control decisions before detailed analysis of disease parameters can be undertaken. We present a flexible metapopulation model of disease spread that incorporates variation in livestock density and includes occasional high-mixing locations or events, such as markets or race meetings. Using probability generating functions derived from this branching process model, we compare the likely success of reactive control strategies in eliminating disease spread. We find that the optimal vaccine strategy varies according to the disease transmission rate, with homogeneous vaccination most effective for low transmission rates, and heterogeneous vaccination preferable for high levels of transmission. Quarantine combines well with vaccination, with the chance of disease elimination enhanced even for vaccines with low efficacy. Control decisions surrounding horse race meetings were of particular concern during the 2007 outbreak of equine influenza in Australia. We show that this type of high-mixing event is a powerful spread mechanism, even when the proportion of time spent at such events is low. If such locations remain open, elimination will require a highly effective vaccine with high coverage. However, a policy of banning animals from quarantined regions from attending such events can provide an effective alternative if full closure of events is economically or politically untenable.},

Three typical spatial information parameters including working unit/address, onset location and reporting unit were selected and SARS epidemic spread in-out flow in Beijing was defined based on the SARS epidemiological investigation data in China from 2002 to 2003 while its epidemiological characteristics were discussed. Furthermore, by the methods of spatial-temporal statistical analysis and network characteristic analysis, spatial-temporal high-risk hotspots and network structure characteristics of Beijing outer in-out flow were explored, and spatial autocorrelation/heterogeneity, spatial-temporal evolutive rules and structure characteristics of the spread network of Beijing inner in-out flow were comprehensively analyzed. The results show that (1) The outer input flow of SARS epidemic in Beijing concentrated on Shanxi and Guangdong provinces, but the outer output flow was disperse and mainly includes several north provinces such as Guangdong and Shandong. And the control measurement should focus on the early and interim progress of SARS breakout. (2) The inner output cases had significant positive autocorrelative characteristics in the whole studied region, and the high-risk population was young and middle-aged people with ages from 20 to 60 and occupations of medicine and civilian labourer. (3) The downtown districts were main high-risk hotspots of SARS epidemic in Beijing, the northwest suburban districts/counties were secondary high-risk hotspots, and northeast suburban areas were relatively safe. (4) The district/county nodes in inner spread network showed small-world characteristics and information/material flow had notable heterogeneity. The suburban Tongzhou and Changping districts were the underlying high-risk regions, and several suburban districts such as Shunyi and Huairou were the relatively low-risk safe regions as they carried out minority information/material flow. The exploration and analysis based on epidemic spread in-out flow help better detect and discover the potential spatial-temporal evolutive rules and characteristics of SARS epidemic, and provide a more effective theoretical basis for emergency/control measurements and decision-making.},

Moreover, the input/output transmission networks of the SARS epidemic are built according to the definition of in-out flow. The spatiotemporal distribution of the SARS in-out flow, spatial distribution and temporal change of node characteristic parameters, and the structural characteristics of the SARS transmission networks are comprehensively and systematically explored. The results show that (1) Beijing and Guangdong had the highest risk of self-spread and output cases, and prevention/control measures directed toward self-spread cases in Beijing should have focused on the later period of the SARS epidemic; (2) the SARS transmission networks in mainland China had significant clustering characteristics, with two clustering areas of output cases centered in Beijing and Guangdong; (3) Guangdong was the original source of the SARS epidemic, and while the infected cases of most other provinces occurred mainly during the early period, there was no significant spread to the surrounding provinces; in contrast, although the input/output interactions between Beijing and the other provinces countrywide began during the mid-late epidemic period, SARS in Beijing showed a significant capacity for spatial spreading; (4) Guangdong had a significant range of spatial spreading throughout the entire epidemic period, while Beijing and its surrounding provinces formed a separate, significant range of high-risk spreading during the mid-late period; especially in late period, the influence range of Beijing's neighboring provinces, such as Hebei, was even slightly larger than that of Beijing; and (5) the input network had a low-intensity spread capacity and middle-level influence range, while the output network had an extensive high-intensity spread capacity and influence range that covered almost the entire country, and this spread and influence indicated that significant clustering characteristics increased gradually. This analysis of the epidemic in-out flow and its corresponding transmission network helps reveal the potential spatiotemporal characteristics and evolvement mechanism of the SARS epidemic and provides more effective theoretical support for prevention and control measures.},

  abstract     = {A novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causing severe, life-threatening respiratory disease has emerged in the Middle East at a time when two international mass gatherings in Saudi Arabia are imminent. While MERS-CoV has already spread to and within other countries, these mass gatherings could further amplify and/or accelerate its international dissemination, especially since the origins and geographic source of the virus remain poorly understood. We analyzed 2012 worldwide flight itinerary data and historic Hajj pilgrim data to predict population movements out of Saudi Arabia and the broader Middle East to help cities and countries assess their potential for MERS-CoV importation. We compared the magnitude of travel to countries with their World Bank economic status and per capita healthcare expenditures as surrogate markers of their capacity for timely detection of imported MERS-CoV and their ability to mount an effective public health response. 16.8 million travelers flew on commercial flights out of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates between June and November 2012, of which 51.6% were destined for India (16.3%), Egypt (10.4%), Pakistan (7.8%), the United Kingdom (4.3%), Kuwait (3.6%), Bangladesh (3.1%), Iran (3.1%) and Bahrain (2.9%). Among the 1.74 million foreign pilgrims who performed the Hajj last year, an estimated 65.1% originated from low and lower-middle income countries. MERS-CoV is an emerging pathogen with pandemic potential with its apparent epicenter in Saudi Arabia, where millions of pilgrims will imminently congregate for two international mass gatherings. Understanding global population movements out of the Middle East through the end of this year's Hajj could help direct anticipatory MERS-CoV surveillance and public health preparedness to mitigate its potential global health and economic impacts.},

We compared the influenza attack rate among employees resulting from workplace transmission, focusing on the effects of presenteeism (going to work when ill). In a simulated influenza epidemic (R0 = 1.4), the attack rate among employees owing to workplace transmission was 11.54%. A large proportion (72.00%) of this attack rate resulted from exposure to employees engaging in presenteeism. Universal PSDs reduced workplace infections by 5.86%. Providing 1 or 2 "flu days"-allowing employees with influenza to stay home-reduced workplace infections by 25.33% and 39.22%, respectively. PSDs reduce influenza transmission owing to presenteeism and, hence, the burden of influenza illness in workplaces.},

In contrast to conventional, deterministic modelling approaches, the model described here is predominantly spatial. It incorporates stochastic processing of environmental and social variables that interact in space and time to affect the patterns of disease transmission in a community. The model was validated through a comparative assessment between actual and modelled distribution of diseased locations. Our study shows that the inclusion of location-specific characteristics satisfactorily replicates the spatial dynamics of an infectious disease. The Pearson's correlation coefficients for five trials based on 3-day aggregation of disease counts for 1-3, 4-6 and 7-9 day forecasts were 0.57- 0.95, 0.54-0.86 and 0.57-0.82, respectively, while the correlation based on 5-day aggregation for the 1-5 day forecast was 0.55- 0.94 and 0.58-0.81 for the 6-10 day forecast. The significant and strong relationship between actual results and forecast is encouraging for the potential development of an early warning system for detecting this type of disease outbreaks.},

  abstract        = {To evaluate the impact of age-specific cross-reactive antibody protection levels on the outcomes of a pandemic outbreak of new variants of H3N2 influenza A viruses (H3N2v). We calibrated a previously validated agent-based model of human-to-human transmission of influenza viruses to project the outcomes of various protection levels in a remote and isolated Canadian community, when demographics are drawn from the Statistics Canada census data. We then compared the outcomes with a scenario in which demographic variables were shifted to resemble an urban structure. This comparative evaluation was conducted using in-silico computer simulations, where the epidemiological data were drawn from relevant estimates in published literature. Simulations, using estimates of transmissibility for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain in the study population, show that the epidemic size is primarily affected by the cross-reactive protection levels of young children. A lower number of secondary infections at the early stages of an outbreak does not necessarily correspond to a lower epidemic size. Demographic variables could play a significant role in determining the outcomes of an outbreak. The findings strongly suggest that, when an H3N2v-specific vaccine becomes available, children below the age of 17 should be prioritized for vaccination. This prioritization is essential in population settings with a low average age, including aboriginal communities in northern latitudes.},

This study introduces a time-shifting and discontinuous forcing function H into the scale-free network model to fit the specific period and intensity of the infection, and redefines the probability p as abortive infection rate. For the non-human vectors or hosts, three new factors (new connectivity K(i)(t), new links M, and time delay τ) were introduced in the proposed model of this study. The simulation results of six types of epidemic transmissions show that the proposed Scale-Free Epidemic Models, SFE-1 and SFE-2, are accurate. SFE-1 model and SFE-2 model are useful for the transmission categories from human and insects/vertebrates, respectively. Further comparisons of different races/ethnicities and different transmission categories of AIDS cases in the United States were also analyzed. Both SFE models can be used to predict epidemics and can suggest the results more clearly, irrespective of whether the epidemics are under control. Therefore, the proposed SFE models can help the government determine the level of caution required and predict the results of policy decisions, thus helping to balance socioeconomic and health concerns.},

An age distributed population is placed on the lattice and moves on it. The displacement from a site to a nearest neighbor empty site, allows individuals to change the number and identities of their contacts. The dynamics on the lattice is governed by an attractive interaction between individuals belonging to the same age-class. The parameters, which regulate the pattern dynamics, are fixed fitting the data on the age-dependent daily contact numbers, furnished by the Polymod survey. A simple SIR transmission model with a nearest neighbors interaction and some very basic adaptive mobility restrictions complete the model. The model is validated against the age-distributed Italian epidemiological data for the influenza A(H1N1) during the [Formula: see text] season, with sensible predictions for the epidemiological parameters. For an appropriate topology of the lattice, we find that, whenever the accordance between the contact patterns of the model and the Polymod data is satisfactory, there is a good agreement between the numerical and the experimental epidemiological data. This result shows how rich is the information encoded in the average contact patterns of individuals, with respect to the analysis of the epidemic spreading of an infectious disease.},

  abstract        = {With new cases of avian influenza H5N1 (H5N1AV) arising frequently, the threat of a new influenza pandemic remains a challenge for public health. Several vaccines have been developed specifically targeting H5N1AV, but their production is limited and only a few million doses are readily available. Because there is an important time lag between the emergence of new pandemic strain and the development and distribution of a vaccine, shortage of vaccine is very likely at the beginning of a pandemic. We coupled a mathematical model with a genetic algorithm to optimally and dynamically distribute vaccine in a network of cities, connected by the airline transportation network. By minimizing the illness attack rate (i.e., the percentage of people in the population who become infected and ill), we focus on optimizing vaccine allocation in a network of 16 cities in Southeast Asia when only a few million doses are available. In our base case, we assume the vaccine is well-matched and vaccination occurs 5 to 10 days after the beginning of the epidemic. The effectiveness of all the vaccination strategies drops off as the timing is delayed or the vaccine is less well-matched. Under the best assumptions, optimal vaccination strategies substantially reduced the illness attack rate, with a maximal reduction in the attack rate of 85%. Furthermore, our results suggest that cooperative strategies where the resources are optimally distributed among the cities perform much better than the strategies where the vaccine is equally distributed among the network, yielding an illness attack rate 17% lower. We show that it is possible to significantly mitigate a more global epidemic with limited quantities of vaccine, provided that the vaccination campaign is extremely fast and it occurs within the first weeks of transmission.},

We describe an online cumulative sum based model named Overcrowd-Severe-Respiratory-Disease-Index based on the Modified Overcrowd Index that simultaneously monitors and informs the demand of those supplies and personnel in a healthcare network generating early warnings of severe respiratory disease epidemic outbreaks through the interpretation of such variables. A post hoc historical archive is generated, helping physicians in charge to improve the transit and future allocation of supplies in the entire hospital network during the outbreak. The model was thoroughly verified in a virtual scenario, generating multiple epidemic outbreaks in a 6-year span for a 13-hospital network. When it was superimposed over the H1N1 influenza outbreak census (2008-2010) taken by the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubiran in Mexico City, it showed that it is an effective algorithm to notify early warnings of severe respiratory disease epidemic outbreaks with a minimal rate of false alerts.},

  abstract        = {Cases of a novel swine-origin influenza A(H3N2) variant (H3N2v) have recently been identified in the US, primarily among children. We estimated potential epidemic attack rates (ARs) based on age-specific estimates of sero-susceptibility and social interactions. A contact network model previously established for the Greater Vancouver Area (GVA), Canada was used to estimate average epidemic (infection) ARs for the emerging H3N2v and comparator viruses (H1N1pdm09 and an extinguished H3N2 seasonal strain) based on typical influenza characteristics, basic reproduction number (R(0)), and effective contacts taking into account age-specific sero-protection rates (SPRs). SPRs were assessed in sera collected from the GVA in 2009 or earlier (pre-H1N1pdm09) and fall 2010 (post-H1N1pdm09, seasonal A/Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2), and H3N2v) by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. SPR was assigned per convention based on proportion with HI antibody titre ≥40 (SPR40). Recognizing that the HI titre ≥40 was established as the 50%sero-protective threshold we also explored for ½SPR40, SPR80 and a blended gradient defined as: ¼SPR20, ½SPR40, ¾SPR80, SPR160. Base case analysis assumed R(0) = 1.40, but we also explored R(0) as high as 1.80. With R(0) = 1.40 and SPR40, simulated ARs were well aligned with field observations for H1N1pdm09 incidence (AR: 32%), sporadic detections without a third epidemic wave post-H1N1pdm09 (negligible AR<0.1%) as well as A/Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2) seasonal strain extinction and antigenic drift replacement (negligible AR<0.1%). Simulated AR for the novel swine-origin H3N2v was 6%, highest in children 6-11years (16%). However, with modification to SPR thresholds per above, H3N2v AR ≥20% became possible. At SPR40, H3N2v AR ≥10%, ≥15% or ≥30%, occur if R(0)≥1.48, ≥1.56 or ≥1.86, respectively. Based on conventional assumptions, the novel swine-origin H3N2v does not currently pose a substantial pandemic threat. If H3N2v epidemics do occur, overall community ARs are unlikely to exceed typical seasonal influenza experience. However risk assessment may change with time and depends crucially upon the validation of epidemiological features of influenza, notably the serologic correlate of protection and R(0).},

  abstract        = {RNA viruses exist as genetically diverse populations. It is thought that diversity and genetic structure of viral populations determine the rapid adaptation observed in RNA viruses and hence their pathogenesis. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus evolution has been limited by the inability to accurately describe the genetic structure of virus populations. Next-generation sequencing technologies generate data of sufficient depth to characterize virus populations, but are limited in their utility because most variants are present at very low frequencies and are thus indistinguishable from next-generation sequencing errors. Here we present an approach that reduces next-generation sequencing errors and allows the description of virus populations with unprecedented accuracy. Using this approach, we define the mutation rates of poliovirus and uncover the mutation landscape of the population. Furthermore, by monitoring changes in variant frequencies on serially passaged populations, we determined fitness values for thousands of mutations across the viral genome. Mapping of these fitness values onto three-dimensional structures of viral proteins offers a powerful approach for exploring structure-function relationships and potentially uncovering new functions. To our knowledge, our study provides the first single-nucleotide fitness landscape of an evolving RNA virus and establishes a general experimental platform for studying the genetic changes underlying the evolution of virus populations.},

  abstract        = {Several high-income countries have pre-entry screening programmes for tuberculosis. We aimed to establish the yield of pre-entry screening programmes to inform evidence-based policy for migrant health screening. We searched six bibliographic databases for experimental or observational studies and systematic reviews, which reported data on migrant screening for active or latent tuberculosis by any method before migration to a low-incidence country. Primary outcomes were principal reported screening yield of active tuberculosis, yield of culture-confirmed cases, and yield of sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli cases. Where appropriate, fixed-effects models were used to summarise the yield of pre-entry screening across included studies. We identified 15 unique studies with data for 3 739 266 migrants screened pre-entry for tuberculosis between 1982 and 2010. Heterogeneity was high for all primary outcomes. After stratification by prevalence in country of origin, heterogeneity was reduced for culture-confirmed and smear-confirmed cases. Yield of culture-confirmed cases increased with prevalence in the country of origin, and summary estimates ranged from 19·7 (95% CI 10·3-31·5) cases identified per 100 000 individuals screened in countries with a prevalence of 50-149 cases per 100 000 population to 335·9 (283·0-393·2) per 100 000 in countries with a prevalence of greater than 350 per 100 000 population. Targeting high-prevalence countries could result in the highest yield for active disease. Pre-entry screening should be considered as part of a broad package of measures to ensure early diagnosis and effective management of migrants with active tuberculosis, and be integrated with initiatives that address the health needs of migrants.

  abstract        = {Determining the pandemic potential of an emerging infectious disease and how it depends on the various epidemic and population aspects is critical for the preparation of an adequate response aimed at its control. The complex interplay between population movements in space and non-homogeneous mixing patterns have so far hindered the fundamental understanding of the conditions for spatial invasion through a general theoretical framework. To address this issue, we present an analytical modelling approach taking into account such interplay under general conditions of mobility and interactions, in the simplifying assumption of two population classes. We describe a spatially structured population with non-homogeneous mixing and travel behaviour through a multi-host stochastic epidemic metapopulation model. Different population partitions, mixing patterns and mobility structures are considered, along with a specific application for the study of the role of age partition in the early spread of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza. We provide a complete mathematical formulation of the model and derive a semi-analytical expression of the threshold condition for global invasion of an emerging infectious disease in the metapopulation system. A rich solution space is found that depends on the social partition of the population, the pattern of contacts across groups and their relative social activity, the travel attitude of each class, and the topological and traffic features of the mobility network. Reducing the activity of the less social group and reducing the cross-group mixing are predicted to be the most efficient strategies for controlling the pandemic potential in the case the less active group constitutes the majority of travellers. If instead traveling is dominated by the more social class, our model predicts the existence of an optimal across-groups mixing that maximises the pandemic potential of the disease, whereas the impact of variations in the activity of each group is less important. The proposed modelling approach introduces a theoretical framework for the study of infectious diseases spread in a population with two layers of heterogeneity relevant for the local transmission and the spatial propagation of the disease. It can be used for pandemic preparedness studies to identify adequate interventions and quantitatively estimate the corresponding required effort, as well as in an emerging epidemic situation to assess the pandemic potential of the pathogen from population and early outbreak data.},

We observed that imposing restrictions on the movement of infected humans is not a highly effective strategy. In contrast, isolating infected individuals with high levels of compliance by the human population is efficient even when implemented with delays during an ongoing outbreak. We also studied insecticide-spraying strategies assuming different (hypothetical) efficiencies. We observed that highly efficient fumigation strategies seem to be effective during an outbreak. Nevertheless, taking into account the controversial results on the use of spraying as a single control strategy, we suggest that carrying out combined strategies of fumigation and isolation during an epidemic outbreak should account for a suitable strategy for the attenuation of epidemic outbreaks.},

According to the International Health Regulations (2005), decades of development strategies for border quarantine have covered not only routine practices and specific measures for handling a pandemic but also have drawn attention to the development of core capacities at designated points of entry. However, as a result of the rapidly increasing number of points of entry, changes in transportation patterns, and the emergence of diseases, current border quarantine practice is being challenged to maintain human resources and the efficacy of entry screening. It is therefore critical to reexamine border quarantine strategies that will fit future needs and national conditions. This article reviews the current border health practices in Taiwan and discusses 5 key challenges to be further considered and improved. The findings can serve as a guide for further policy reform in Taiwan and other countries.},

The objective of this study was to predict the risk of future human infections with H7N9 in China and neighboring countries by assessing the association between H7N9 cases at sentinel hospitals and putative agricultural, climatic, and demographic risk factors. This cross-sectional study used the locations of H7N9 cases and negative cases from China's influenza-like illness surveillance network. After identifying H7N9 risk factors with logistic regression, we used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to construct predictive maps of H7N9 risk across Asia. Live bird market density was associated with human H7N9 infections reported in China from March-May 2013. Based on these cases, our model accurately predicted the virus' spread into Guangxi autonomous region in February 2014. Outside China, we find there is a high risk that the virus will spread to northern Vietnam, due to the import of poultry from China. Our risk map can focus efforts to improve surveillance in poultry and humans, which may facilitate early identification and treatment of human cases.},

  abstract     = {For the first time, an outbreak of chikungunya has been reported in the Americas. Locally acquired infections have been confirmed in fourteen Caribbean countries and dependent territories, Guyana and French Guiana, in which a large number of North American travelers vacation. Should some travelers become infected with chikungunya virus, they could potentially introduce it into the United States, where there are competent Aedes mosquito vectors, with the possibility of local transmission. We analyzed historical data on airline travelers departing areas of the Caribbean and South America, where locally acquired cases of chikungunya have been confirmed as of May 12th, 2014. The final destinations of travelers departing these areas between May and July 2012 were determined and overlaid on maps of the reported distribution of Aedes aeygpti and albopictus mosquitoes in the United States, to identify potential areas at risk of autochthonous transmission. The United States alone accounted for 52.1% of the final destinations of all international travelers departing chikungunya indigenous areas of the Caribbean between May and July 2012. Cities in the United States with the highest volume of air travelers were New York City, Miami and San Juan (Puerto Rico). Miami and San Juan were high travel-volume cities where Aedes aeygpti or albopictus are reported and where climatic conditions could be suitable for autochthonous transmission. The rapidly evolving outbreak of chikungunya in the Caribbean poses a growing risk to countries and areas linked by air travel, including the United States where competent Aedes mosquitoes exist. The risk of chikungunya importation into the United States may be elevated following key travel periods in the spring, when large numbers of North American travelers typically vacation in the Caribbean.},

An inhomogeneous Reed-Frost epidemic model is then defined on the network, where the inhomogeneity refers to different disease transmission probabilities related to the edge weights. By tuning the model we study the impact of different correlation patterns on the network and epidemics therein. Our results suggest that the basic reproduction number R0 of the epidemic increases (decreases) when the degree-degree correlation coefficient ρ increases (decreases). Furthermore, we show that such effect can be amplified or mitigated depending on the relation between degree and weight distributions as well as the choice of the disease transmission probabilities. In addition, for a more general model allowing additional heterogeneity in the disease transmission probabilities we show that ρ can have the opposite effect on R0.},

  abstract        = {A forecast can be defined as an endeavor to quantitatively estimate a future event or probabilities assigned to a future occurrence. Forecasting stochastic processes such as epidemics is challenging since there are several biological, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence the number of cases observed at each point during an epidemic. However, accurate forecasts of epidemics would impact timely and effective implementation of public health interventions. In this study, we introduce a Dirichlet process (DP) model for classifying and forecasting influenza epidemic curves. The DP model is a nonparametric Bayesian approach that enables the matching of current influenza activity to simulated and historical patterns, identifies epidemic curves different from those observed in the past and enables prediction of the expected epidemic peak time. The method was validated using simulated influenza epidemics from an individual-based model and the accuracy was compared to that of the tree-based classification technique, Random Forest (RF), which has been shown to achieve high accuracy in the early prediction of epidemic curves using a classification approach. We also applied the method to forecasting influenza outbreaks in the United States from 1997-2013 using influenza-like illness (ILI) data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We made the following observations. First, the DP model performed as well as RF in identifying several of the simulated epidemics. Second, the DP model correctly forecasted the peak time several days in advance for most of the simulated epidemics. Third, the accuracy of identifying epidemics different from those already observed improved with additional data, as expected. Fourth, both methods correctly classified epidemics with higher reproduction numbers (R) with a higher accuracy compared to epidemics with lower R values. Lastly, in the classification of seasonal influenza epidemics based on ILI data from the CDC, the methods' performance was comparable. Although RF requires less computational time compared to the DP model, the algorithm is fully supervised implying that epidemic curves different from those previously observed will always be misclassified. In contrast, the DP model can be unsupervised, semi-supervised or fully supervised. Since both methods have their relative merits, an approach that uses both RF and the DP model could be beneficial.},

Existing models of movement either pertain to overly coarse scales, simulate some aspects of movement but not others, or were designed specifically for populations in developed countries. Here, we propose a generalizable framework for simulating the locations that an individual visits, time allocation across those locations, and population-level variation therein. As a case study, we fit alternative models for each of five aspects of movement (number, distance from home and types of locations visited; frequency and duration of visits) to interview data from 157 residents of the city of Iquitos, Peru. Comparison of alternative models showed that location type and distance from home were significant determinants of the locations that individuals visited and how much time they spent there. We also found that for most locations, residents of two neighbourhoods displayed indistinguishable preferences for visiting locations at various distances, despite differing distributions of locations around those neighbourhoods. Finally, simulated patterns of time allocation matched the interview data in a number of ways, suggesting that our framework constitutes a sound basis for simulating fine-scale movement and for investigating factors that influence it.},

  abstract        = {Human mobility is a key component of large-scale spatial-transmission models of infectious diseases. Correctly modeling and quantifying human mobility is critical for improving epidemic control, but may be hindered by data incompleteness or unavailability. Here we explore the opportunity of using proxies for individual mobility to describe commuting flows and predict the diffusion of an influenza-like-illness epidemic. We consider three European countries and the corresponding commuting networks at different resolution scales, obtained from (i) official census surveys, (ii) proxy mobility data extracted from mobile phone call records, and (iii) the radiation model calibrated with census data. Metapopulation models defined on these countries and integrating the different mobility layers are compared in terms of epidemic observables. We show that commuting networks from mobile phone data capture the empirical commuting patterns well, accounting for more than 87% of the total fluxes. The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from mobile phones and census sources are similar and highly correlated, however a systematic overestimation of commuting traffic in the mobile phone data is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster than on census commuting networks, once the mobile phone commuting network is considered in the epidemic model, however preserving to a high degree the order of infection of newly affected locations. Proxies' calibration affects the arrival times' agreement across different models, and the observed topological and traffic discrepancies among mobility sources alter the resulting epidemic invasion patterns. Results also suggest that proxies perform differently in approximating commuting patterns for disease spread at different resolution scales, with the radiation model showing higher accuracy than mobile phone data when the seed is central in the network, the opposite being observed for peripheral locations. Proxies should therefore be chosen in light of the desired accuracy for the epidemic situation under study.},

  abstract        = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to 32 countries and regions within a few months in 2003. There were 5327 SARS cases from November 2002 to May 2003 in Mainland China, which involved 29 provinces, resulted in 349 deaths, and directly caused economic losses of $18.3 billion. This study used an in-out flow model and flow mapping to visualize and explore the spatial pattern of SARS transmission in different regions. In-out flow is measured by the in-out degree and clustering coefficient of SARS. Flow mapping is an exploratory method of spatial visualization for interaction data. The findings were as follows. (1) SARS in-out flow had a clear hierarchy. It formed two main centers, Guangdong in South China and Beijing in North China, and two secondary centers, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, both connected to Beijing. (2) "Spring Festival travel" strengthened external flow, but "SARS panic effect" played a more significant role and pushed the external flow to the peak. (3) External flow and its three typical kinds showed obvious spatial heterogeneity, such as self-spreading flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases only within the province or municipality of onset and medical locations); hospitalized flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases that had been seen by a hospital doctor); and migrant flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases among migrant workers). (4) Internal and external flow tended to occur in younger groups, and occupational differentiation was particularly evident. Low-income groups of male migrants aged 19-35 years were the main routes of external flow. During 2002-2003, SARS in-out flow played an important role in countrywide transmission of the disease in Mainland China. The flow had obvious spatial heterogeneity, which was influenced by migrants' behavior characteristics. In addition, the Chinese holiday effect led to irregular spread of SARS, but the panic effect was more apparent in the middle and late stages of the epidemic. These findings constitute valuable input to prevent and control future serious infectious diseases like SARS.},

  abstract        = {An understanding of epidemiological dynamics is important for prevention and control of epidemic outbreaks. However, previous studies tend to focus only on specific areas, indicating that application to another area or intervention strategy requires a similar time-consuming simulation. Here, we study the epidemic dynamics of the disease-spread over a commute network, using the Tokyo metropolitan area as an example, in an attempt to elucidate the general properties of epidemic spread over a commute network that could be used for a prediction in any metropolitan area. The model is formulated on the basis of a metapopulation network in which local populations are interconnected by actual commuter flows in the Tokyo metropolitan area and the spread of infection is simulated by an individual-based model. We find that the probability of a global epidemic as well as the final epidemic sizes in both global and local populations, the timing of the epidemic peak, and the time at which the epidemic reaches a local population are mainly determined by the joint distribution of the local population sizes connected by the commuter flows, but are insensitive to geographical or topological structure of the network. Moreover, there is a strong relation between the population size and the time that the epidemic reaches this local population and we are able to determine the reason for this relation as well as its dependence on the commute network structure and epidemic parameters. This study shows that the model based on the connection between the population size classes is sufficient to predict both global and local epidemic dynamics in metropolitan area. Moreover, the clear relation of the time taken by the epidemic to reach each local population can be used as a novel measure for intervention; this enables efficient intervention strategies in each local population prior to the actual arrival.},

We analyzed influenza vaccination and influenza severity using Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) data for the 2012-2013 influenza season. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission, death, diagnosis of pneumonia, and hospital and ICU lengths of stay served as measures of disease severity. Data were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression, parametric survival models, and propensity score matching (PSM). Overall, no differences in severity were observed in the multivariable logistic regression model. Using PSM, adults aged 50-64 years (but not other age groups) who were vaccinated against influenza had a shorter length of ICU stay than those who were unvaccinated (hazard ratio for discharge, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.01).

  abstract        = {Reactive vaccination has recently been adopted as an outbreak response tool for cholera and other infectious diseases. Owing to the global shortage of oral cholera vaccine, health officials must quickly decide who and where to distribute limited vaccine. Targeted vaccination in transmission hotspots (i.e. areas with high transmission efficiency) may be a potential approach to efficiently allocate vaccine, however its effectiveness will likely be context-dependent. We compared strategies for allocating vaccine across multiple areas with heterogeneous transmission efficiency. We constructed metapopulation models of a cholera-like disease and compared simulated epidemics where: vaccine is targeted at areas of high or low transmission efficiency, where vaccine is distributed across the population, and where no vaccine is used. We find that connectivity between populations, transmission efficiency, vaccination timing and the amount of vaccine available all shape the performance of different allocation strategies. In highly connected settings (e.g. cities) when vaccinating early in the epidemic, targeting limited vaccine at transmission hotspots is often optimal. Once vaccination is delayed, targeting the hotspot is rarely optimal, and strategies that either spread vaccine between areas or those targeted at non-hotspots will avert more cases. Although hotspots may be an intuitive outbreak control target, we show that, in many situations, the hotspot-epidemic proceeds so fast that hotspot-targeted reactive vaccination will prevent relatively few cases, and vaccination shared across areas where transmission can be sustained is often best.},

This framework has traditionally provided an attractive approach to incorporating more realistic contact structure into epidemic models, since it often preserves analytic tractability (in stochastic as well as deterministic models) but also captures the most salient structural inhomogeneity in contact patterns in many applied contexts. Despite the progress that has been made in both the theory and application of such metapopulation models, we present here several major challenges that remain for future work, focusing on models that, in contrast to agent-based ones, are amenable to mathematical analysis. The challenges range from clarifying the usefulness of systems of weakly-coupled large sub-populations in modelling the spread of specific diseases to developing a theory for endemic models with household structure. They include also developing inferential methods for data on the emerging phase of epidemics, extending metapopulation models to more complex forms of human social structure, developing metapopulation models to reflect spatial population structure, developing computationally efficient methods for calculating key epidemiological model quantities, and integrating within- and between-host dynamics in models.},

  abstract        = {The WHO declared the 2014 west African Ebola epidemic a public health emergency of international concern in view of its potential for further international spread. Decision makers worldwide are in need of empirical data to inform and implement emergency response measures. Our aim was to assess the potential for Ebola virus to spread across international borders via commercial air travel and assess the relative efficiency of exit versus entry screening of travellers at commercial airports. We analysed International Air Transport Association data for worldwide flight schedules between Sept 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2014, and historic traveller flight itinerary data from 2013 to describe expected global population movements via commercial air travel out of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Coupled with Ebola virus surveillance data, we modelled the expected number of internationally exported Ebola virus infections, the potential effect of air travel restrictions, and the efficiency of airport-based traveller screening at international ports of entry and exit. We deemed individuals initiating travel from any domestic or international airport within these three countries to have possible exposure to Ebola virus. We deemed all other travellers to have no significant risk of exposure to Ebola virus. Based on epidemic conditions and international flight restrictions to and from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone as of Sept 1, 2014 (reductions in passenger seats by 51% for Liberia, 66% for Guinea, and 85% for Sierra Leone), our model projects 2.8 travellers infected with Ebola virus departing the above three countries via commercial flights, on average, every month. 91,547 (64%) of all air travellers departing Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone had expected destinations in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Screening international travellers departing three airports would enable health assessments of all travellers at highest risk of exposure to Ebola virus infection. Decision makers must carefully balance the potential harms from travel restrictions imposed on countries that have Ebola virus activity against any potential reductions in risk from Ebola virus importations. Exit screening of travellers at airports in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone would be the most efficient frontier at which to assess the health status of travellers at risk of Ebola virus exposure, however, this intervention might require international support to implement effectively.

  abstract        = {Spatial structure and hence the spatial position of host populations plays a vital role in the spread of infection. In the majority of situations, it is only possible to predict the spatial spread of infection using simulation models, which can be computationally demanding especially for large population sizes. Here we develop an approximation method that vastly reduces this computational burden. We assume that the transmission rates between individuals or sub-populations are determined by a spatial transmission kernel. This kernel is assumed to be isotropic, such that the transmission rate is simply a function of the distance between susceptible and infectious individuals; as such this provides the ideal mechanism for modelling localised transmission in a spatial environment. We show that the spatial force of infection acting on all susceptibles can be represented as a spatial convolution between the transmission kernel and a spatially extended 'image' of the infection state. This representation allows the rapid calculation of stochastic rates of infection using fast-Fourier transform (FFT) routines, which greatly improves the computational efficiency of spatial simulations. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this fast spectral rate recalculation (FSR) method with two examples: an idealised scenario simulating an SIR-type epidemic outbreak amongst N habitats distributed across a two-dimensional plane; the spread of infection between US cattle farms, illustrating that the FSR method makes continental-scale outbreak forecasting feasible with desktop processing power. The latter model demonstrates which areas of the US are at consistently high risk for cattle-infections, although predictions of epidemic size are highly dependent on assumptions about the tail of the transmission kernel.},

The ability to more accurately assess infection levels and predict which regions have higher infection risk in future time periods can instruct targeted prevention and treatment efforts, especially during epidemics. Google Flu Trends (GFT) has generated significant hope that "big data" can be an effective tool for estimating disease burden and spread. The estimates generated by GFT come in real-time--two weeks earlier than traditional surveillance data collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, GFT had some infamous errors and is significantly less accurate at tracking laboratory-confirmed cases than syndromic influenza-like illness (ILI) cases. We construct an empirical network using CDC data and combine this with GFT to substantially improve its performance. This improved model predicts infections one week into the future as well as GFT predicts the present and does particularly well in regions that are most likely to facilitate influenza spread and during epidemics.},

These large scale epidemic simulations have recently become an important application of high-performance computing. The network model proposed performs better than the traditional epidemic model based on ordinary differential equations since it adjusts better to the irregularity of the real world data. In addition, the network model allows the consideration of many possibilities regarding the spread of influenza at the population level. The results presented here show how well the SEIR model fits the data for the AH1N1 time series despite the irregularity of the data and returns parameter values that are in good agreement with the medical data regarding AH1N1 influenza virus. This versatile network model approach may be applied to the simulation of the transmission dynamics of several epidemics in human networks. In addition, the simulation can provide useful information for the understanding, prediction and control of the transmission of influenza A(H1N1) epidemics.},

Theoretical epidemiology shows that the speed of an epidemic is governed by the life-history characteristics of the pathogen and its ability to disperse. Rapid evolution of these traits during the invasion may thus affect the speed of epidemics. Here we study the influence of virulence evolution on the spatial spread of an epidemic. At the edge of the invasion front, we show that more virulent and transmissible genotypes are expected to win the competition with other pathogens. Behind the front line, however, more prudent exploitation strategies outcompete virulent pathogens. Crucially, even when the presence of the virulent mutant is limited to the edge of the front, the invasion speed can be dramatically altered by pathogen evolution. We support our analysis with individual-based simulations and we discuss the additional effects of demographic stochasticity taking place at the front line on virulence evolution. We confirm that an increase of virulence can occur at the front, but only if the carrying capacity of the invading pathogen is large enough. These results are discussed in the light of recent empirical studies examining virulence evolution at the edge of spreading epidemics.},

  abstract        = {Mathematical modeling of influenza epidemic is important for analyzing the main cause of the epidemic and finding effective interventions towards it. The epidemic is a dynamic process. In this process, daily infections are caused by people's contacts, and the frequency of contacts can be mainly influenced by their cognition to the disease. The cognition is in turn influenced by daily illness attack rate, climate, and other environment factors. Few existing methods considered the dynamic process in their models. Therefore, their prediction results can hardly be explained by the mechanisms of epidemic spreading. In this paper, we developed a heterogeneous graph modeling approach (HGM) to describe the dynamic process of influenza virus transmission by taking advantage of our unique clinical data. We built social network of studied region and embedded an Agent-Based Model (ABM) in the HGM to describe the dynamic change of an epidemic. Our simulations have a good agreement with clinical data. Parameter sensitivity analysis showed that temperature influences the dynamic of epidemic significantly and system behavior analysis showed social network degree is a critical factor determining the size of an epidemic. Finally, multiple scenarios for vaccination and school closure strategies were simulated and their performance was analyzed.},

  abstract        = {In cases where there are limited resources for the eradication of an epidemic, or where we seek to minimise possible adverse impacts of interventions, it is essential to optimise the efficacy of control measures. We introduce a new approach, Epidemic Control Analysis (ECA), to design effective targeted intervention strategies to mitigate and control the propagation of infections across heterogeneous contact networks. We exemplify this methodology in the context of a newly developed individual-level deterministic Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) epidemiological model (we also briefly consider applications to Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) dynamics). This provides a flexible way to systematically determine the impact of interventions on endemic infections in the population. Individuals are ranked based on their influence on the level of infectivity. The highest-ranked individuals are prioritised for targeted intervention. Many previous intervention strategies have determined prioritisation based mainly on the position of individuals in the network, described by various local and global network centrality measures, and their chance of being infectious. Comparisons of the predictions of the proposed strategy with those of widely used targeted intervention programmes on various model and real-world networks reveal its efficiency and accuracy. It is demonstrated that targeting central individuals or individuals that have high infection probability is not always the best strategy. The importance of individuals is not determined by network structure alone, but can be highly dependent on the infection dynamics. This interplay between network structure and infection dynamics is effectively captured by ECA.},

We report a pattern of skip-and-resurgence behavior between the years 2011 and 2013 for influenza H1N1pdm, the strain responsible for the 2009 pandemic, in Europe and Eastern Asia. In particular, the expected H1N1pdm epidemic outbreak in 2011/12 failed to occur (or "skipped") in many countries across the globe, although an outbreak occurred in the following year. We also report a pattern of well-synchronized wave of H1N1pdm in early 2011 in the Northern Hemisphere countries, and a pattern of replacement of strain H1N1pre by H1N1pdm between the 2009 and 2012 influenza seasons. Using both a statistical and a mechanistic mathematical model, and through fitting the data of 108 countries, we discuss the mechanisms that are likely to generate these events taking into account the role of multi-strain dynamics. A basic understanding of these patterns has important public health implications and scientific significance.},

The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of infections play out on a wide range of interconnected temporal, organizational, and spatial scales, which span hours to months, cells to ecosystems, and local to global spread. Moreover, some pathogens are directly transmitted between individuals of a single species, whereas others circulate among multiple hosts, need arthropod vectors, or can survive in environmental reservoirs. Many factors, including increasing antimicrobial resistance, increased human connectivity and changeable human behavior, elevate prevention and control from matters of national policy to international challenge. In the face of this complexity, mathematical models offer valuable tools for synthesizing information to understand epidemiological patterns, and for developing quantitative evidence for decision-making in global health.},

  abstract        = {Multiple waves of transmission during infectious disease epidemics represent a major public health challenge, but the ecological and behavioral drivers of epidemic resurgence are poorly understood. In theory, community structure—aggregation into highly intraconnected and loosely interconnected social groups—within human populations may lead to punctuated outbreaks as diseases progress from one community to the next. However, this explanation has been largely overlooked in favor of temporal shifts in environmental conditions and human behavior and because of the difficulties associated with estimating large-scale contact patterns. The aim was to characterize naturally arising patterns of human contact that are capable of producing simulated epidemics with multiple wave structures. We used an extensive dataset of proximal physical contacts between users of a public Wi-Fi Internet system to evaluate the epidemiological implications of an empirical urban contact network. We characterized the modularity (community structure) of the network and then estimated epidemic dynamics under a percolation-based model of infectious disease spread on the network. We classified simulated epidemics as multiwave using a novel metric and we identified network structures that were critical to the network's ability to produce multiwave epidemics. We identified robust community structure in a large, empirical urban contact network from which multiwave epidemics may emerge naturally. This pattern was fueled by a special kind of insularity in which locally popular individuals were not the ones forging contacts with more distant social groups. Our results suggest that ordinary contact patterns can produce multiwave epidemics at the scale of a single urban area without the temporal shifts that are usually assumed to be responsible. Understanding the role of community structure in epidemic dynamics allows officials to anticipate epidemic resurgence without having to forecast future changes in hosts, pathogens, or the environment.},

Interventions were scored according outcome, required resources, preparation, passenger inconvenience and passenger compliance. Provision of information to travelers, isolation, health monitoring, hygiene measures and vector control reportedly prevent disease spread and are well applicable. Contact tracing can be supportive in controlling disease spread but depend on disease characteristics. Exit and entry screening, quarantine and travel restrictions are unlikely to be very effective in preventing disease spread, while implementation requires extensive resources or travel implications. Control measures should focus on providing information towards travelers, isolation, health monitoring and hygiene measures. Appropriateness of measures depends on disease characteristics, and the required resources. As most studies analyze one type of measure in a particular situation, further research comparing the effectiveness of measures is recommended.},

Agent-based models are increasingly being recognized as the next generation of epidemiological models. In this research, we use the ability of agent-based models to incorporate behavior into simulations by examining the relative importance of vaccination and social distancing, two common measures for controlling the spread of infectious diseases, with respect to seasonal influenza. We modeled health behaviour using the result of a Health Belief Model study focused on influenza. We considered a control and a treatment group to explore the effect of education on people's health-related behaviors patterns. The control group reflects the behavioral patterns of students based on their general knowledge of influenza and its interventions while the treatment group illustrates the level of behavioral changes after individuals have been educated by a health care expert. The results of this study indicate that self-initiated behaviors are successful in controlling an outbreak in a high contact rate location such as a university. Self-initiated behaviors resulted in a population attack rate decrease of 17% and a 25% reduction in the peak number of cases. The simulation also provides significant evidence for the effect of an HBM theory-based educational program to increase the rate of applying the target interventions (vaccination by 22% percent and social distancing by 41%) and consequently to control the outbreak.},

  abstract        = {In New Haven County, CT (NHC), influenza hospitalization rates have been shown to increase with census tract poverty in multiple influenza seasons. Though multiple factors have been hypothesized to cause these inequalities, including population structure, differential vaccine uptake, and differential access to healthcare, the impact of each in generating observed inequalities remains unknown. We can design interventions targeting factors with the greatest explanatory power if we quantify the proportion of observed inequalities that hypothesized factors are able to generate. Here, we ask if population structure is sufficient to generate the observed area-level inequalities in NHC. To our knowledge, this is the first use of simulation models to examine the causes of differential poverty-related influenza rates. Using agent-based models with a census-informed, realistic representation of household size, age-structure, population density in NHC census tracts, and contact rates in workplaces, schools, households, and neighborhoods, we measured poverty-related differential influenza attack rates over the course of an epidemic with a 23 % overall clinical attack rate. We examined the role of asthma prevalence rates as well as individual contact rates and infection susceptibility in generating observed area-level influenza inequalities. Simulated attack rates (AR) among adults increased with census tract poverty level (F = 30.5; P < 0.001) in an epidemic caused by a virus similar to A (H1N1) pdm09. We detected a steeper, earlier influenza rate increase in high-poverty census tracts-a finding that we corroborate with a temporal analysis of NHC surveillance data during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The ratio of the simulated adult AR in the highest- to lowest-poverty tracts was 33 % of the ratio observed in surveillance data. Increasing individual contact rates in the neighborhood did not increase simulated area-level inequalities. When we modified individual susceptibility such that it was inversely proportional to household income, inequalities in AR between high- and low-poverty census tracts were comparable to those observed in reality. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use simulations to probe the causes of observed inequalities in influenza disease patterns. Knowledge of the causes and their relative explanatory power will allow us to design interventions that have the greatest impact on reducing inequalities. Differential exposure due to population structure in our realistic simulation model explains a third of the observed inequality. Differential susceptibility to disease due to prevailing chronic conditions, vaccine uptake, and smoking should be considered in future models in order to quantify the role of additional factors in generating influenza inequalities.},

  abstract        = {The reemergence and geographical dispersal of vector-borne diseases challenge global health experts around the world and in particular, dengue poses increasing difficulties in the Americas, due in part to explosive urban and semi-urban growth, increases of within and between region mobility, the absence of a vaccine, and the limited resources available for public health services. In this work, a simple deterministic two-patch model is introduced to assess the impact of dengue transmission dynamics in heterogeneous environments. The two-patch system models the movement (e.g. urban versus rural areas residence times) of individuals between and within patches/environments using residence-time matrices with entries that budget within and between host patch relative residence times, under the assumption that only the human budgets their residence time across regions. Three scenarios are considered: (i) resident hosts in Patch i visit patch j, where i≠j but not the other way around, a scenario referred to as unidirectional motion; (ii) symmetric bi-directional motion; and (iii) asymmetric bi-directional motion. Optimal control theory is used to identify and evaluate patch-specific control measures aimed at reducing dengue prevalence in humans and vectors at a minimal cost. Optimal policies are computed under different residence-matrix configurations mentioned above as well as transmissibility scenarios characterized by the magnitude of the basic reproduction number. Optimal patch-specific polices can ameliorate the impact of epidemic outbreaks substantially when the basic reproduction number is moderate. The final patch-specific epidemic size variation increases as the residence time matrix moves away from the symmetric case (asymmetry). As expected, the patch where individuals spend most of their time or in the patch where transmissibility is higher tend to support larger patch-specific final epidemic sizes. Hence, focusing on intervention that target areas where individuals spend "most" time or where transmissibility is higher turn out to be optimal. Therefore, reducing traffic is likely to take a host-vector system into the world of manageable outbreaks.},

This model is based on the daily confirmed cases of A/H1N1 influenza collected by the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention from April 27 to September 15, 2009 and the daily commuting data from 33 districts of SMA reported in the 2010 Population and Housing Census (PHC). We analyzed the spread patterns of 2009 influenza in the SMA by the reproductive numbers and geographic information systems. During the early period of novel influenza pandemics, when pharmaceutical interventions are lacking, non-pharmaceutical public health interventions will be the most critical strategies for impeding the spread of influenza and delaying an epidemic. Using the spatial-temporal model developed herein, we also investigated the impact of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions, isolation and/or commuting restrictions, on the incidence reduction in various scenarios. Our model provides scientific evidence for predicting the spread of disease and preparedness for a future pandemic.},

  abstract        = {Influenza poses a significant public health burden worldwide. Understanding how and to what extent people would change their behaviour in response to influenza outbreaks is critical for formulating public health policies. We incorporated the information-theoretic framework into a behaviour-influenza (BI) transmission dynamics system in order to understand the effects of individual behavioural change on influenza epidemics. We showed that information transmission of risk perception played a crucial role in the spread of health-seeking behaviour throughout influenza epidemics. Here a network BI model provides a new approach for understanding the risk perception spread and human behavioural change during disease outbreaks. Our study allows simultaneous consideration of epidemiological, psychological, and social factors as predictors of individual perception rates in behaviour-disease transmission systems. We suggest that a monitoring system with precise information on risk perception should be constructed to effectively promote health behaviours in preparation for emerging disease outbreaks.},

We developed an original causal model integrating highly diverse factors and their dependencies, to identify the most critical determinants of pandemic influenza infection (H1N1pdm09) during the 2010-2011 influenza season. We used data from 601 households (1450 participants) included in a dedicated cohort. Structural equations were used to model direct and indirect relationships between infection and risk perception, compliance with preventive behaviours, social contacts, indoor and outdoor environment, sociodemographic factors and pre-epidemic host susceptibility. Standardised estimates (βstd) were used to assess the strength of associations (ranging from -1 for a completely negative association to 1 for a completely positive association). Host susceptibility to H1N1pdm09 and compliance with preventive behaviours were the only two factors directly associated with the infection risk (βstd=0.31 and βstd=-0.21). Compliance with preventive behaviours was influenced by risk perception and preventive measures perception (βstd=0.14 and βstd=0.27). The number and duration of social contacts were not associated with H1N1pdm09 infection. Our findings suggest that influenza vaccination in addition to public health communication campaigns focusing on personal preventive measures should be prioritised as potentially efficient interventions to mitigate influenza epidemics.},

  abstract        = {The 2014 epidemic of Ebola virus disease in parts of west Africa defines an unprecedented health threat. We developed a model of Ebola virus transmission that integrates detailed geographical and demographic data from Liberia to overcome the limitations of non-spatial approaches in projecting the disease dynamics and assessing non-pharmaceutical control interventions. We modelled the movements of individuals, including patients not infected with Ebola virus, seeking assistance in health-care facilities, the movements of individuals taking care of patients infected with Ebola virus not admitted to hospital, and the attendance of funerals. Individuals were grouped into randomly assigned households (size based on Demographic Health Survey data) that were geographically placed to match population density estimates on a grid of 3157 cells covering the country. The spatial agent-based model was calibrated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The model was used to estimate Ebola virus transmission parameters and investigate the effectiveness of interventions such as availability of Ebola treatment units, safe burials procedures, and household protection kits. Up to Aug 16, 2014, we estimated that 38·3% of infections (95% CI 17·4-76·4) were acquired in hospitals, 30·7% (14·1-46·4) in households, and 8·6% (3·2-11·8) while participating in funerals. We noted that the movement and mixing, in hospitals at the early stage of the epidemic, of patients infected with Ebola virus and those not infected was a sufficient driver of the reported pattern of spatial spread. The subsequent decrease of incidence at country and county level is attributable to the increasing availability of Ebola treatment units (which in turn contributed to drastically decreased hospital transmission), safe burials, and distribution of household protection kits. The model allows assessment of intervention options and the understanding of their role in the decrease in incidence reported since Sept 7, 2014. High-quality data (eg, to estimate household secondary attack rate, contact patterns within hospitals, and effects of ongoing interventions) are needed to reduce uncertainty in model estimates.

  abstract        = {Moment-closure techniques are commonly used to generate low-dimensional deterministic models to approximate the average dynamics of stochastic systems on networks. The quality of such closures is usually difficult to asses and furthermore the relationship between model assumptions and closure accuracy are often difficult, if not impossible, to quantify. Here we carefully examine some commonly used moment closures, in particular a new one based on the concept of maximum entropy, for approximating the spread of epidemics on networks by reconstructing the probability distributions over triplets based on those over pairs. We consider various models (SI, SIR, SEIR and Reed-Frost-type) under Markovian and non-Markovian assumption characterising the latent and infectious periods. We initially study with care two special networks, namely the open triplet and closed triangle, for which we can obtain analytical results. We then explore numerically the exactness of moment closures for a wide range of larger motifs, thus gaining understanding of the factors that introduce errors in the approximations, in particular the presence of a random duration of the infectious period and the presence of overlapping triangles in a network. We also derive a simpler and more intuitive proof than previously available concerning the known result that pair-based moment closure is exact for the Markovian SIR model on tree-like networks under pure initial conditions. We also extend such a result to all infectious models, Markovian and non-Markovian, in which susceptibles escape infection independently from each infected neighbour and for which infectives cannot regain susceptible status, provided the network is tree-like and initial conditions are pure. This works represent a valuable step in enriching intuition and deepening understanding of the assumptions behind moment closure approximations and for putting them on a more rigorous mathematical footing.},

  abstract        = {Animal societies rely on interactions between group members to effectively communicate and coordinate their actions. To date, the transmission properties of interaction networks formed by direct physical contacts have been extensively studied for many animal societies and in all cases found to inhibit spreading. Such direct interactions do not, however, represent the only viable pathways. When spreading agents can persist in the environment, indirect transmission via 'same-place, different-time' spatial coincidences becomes possible. Previous studies have neglected these indirect pathways and their role in transmission. Here, we use rock ant colonies, a model social species whose flat nest geometry, coupled with individually tagged workers, allowed us to build temporally and spatially explicit interaction networks in which edges represent either direct physical contacts or indirect spatial coincidences. We show how the addition of indirect pathways allows the network to enhance or inhibit the spreading of different types of agent. This dual-functionality arises from an interplay between the interaction-strength distribution generated by the ants' movement and environmental decay characteristics of the spreading agent. These findings offer a general mechanism for understanding how interaction patterns might be tuned in animal societies to control the simultaneous transmission of harmful and beneficial agents.},

  abstract        = {We compare two broad types of empirically grounded random network models in terms of their abilities to capture both network features and simulated Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic dynamics. The types of network models are exponential random graph models (ERGMs) and extensions of the configuration model. We use three kinds of empirical contact networks, chosen to provide both variety and realistic patterns of human contact: a highly clustered network, a bipartite network and a snowball sampled network of a "hidden population". In the case of the snowball sampled network we present a novel method for fitting an edge-triangle model. In our results, ERGMs consistently capture clustering as well or better than configuration-type models, but the latter models better capture the node degree distribution. Despite the additional computational requirements to fit ERGMs to empirical networks, the use of ERGMs provides only a slight improvement in the ability of the models to recreate epidemic features of the empirical network in simulated SIR epidemics. Generally, SIR epidemic results from using configuration-type models fall between those from a random network model (i.e., an Erdős-Rényi model) and an ERGM. The addition of subgraphs of size four to edge-triangle type models does improve agreement with the empirical network for smaller densities in clustered networks. Additional subgraphs do not make a noticeable difference in our example, although we would expect the ability to model cliques to be helpful for contact networks exhibiting household structure.},

Therefore, it is important to assess what strategy is the most effective in identifying the onset of an epidemic and in minimizing the number of infected farms. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the performance of the bovine tuberculosis (bTB) surveillance system in the network of dairy farms in the Emilia-Romagna (ER) Region, Italy. A bTB-free Region since 2007, ER implements an integrated surveillance strategy based on three components, namely routine on-farm tuberculin skin-testing performed every 3 years, tuberculin skin-testing of cattle exchanged between farms, and post-mortem inspection at slaughterhouses. We assessed the effectiveness of surveillance by means of a stochastic network model of both within-farm and between-farm bTB dynamics calibrated on data available for ER dairy farms. Epidemic dynamics were simulated for five scenarios: the current ER surveillance system, a no surveillance scenario that we used as the benchmark to characterize epidemic dynamics, three additional scenarios in which one of the surveillance components was removed at a time so as to outline its significance in detecting the infection. For each scenario we ran Monte Carlo simulations of bTB epidemics following the random introduction of an infected individual in the network. System performances were assessed through the comparative analysis of a number of statistics, including the time required for epidemic detection and the total number of infected farms during the epidemic. Our analysis showed that slaughterhouse inspection is the most effective surveillance component in reducing the time for disease detection, while routine surveillance in reducing the number of multi-farms epidemics. On the other hand, testing exchanged cattle improved the performance of the surveillance system only marginally.},

It is of great importance for network science and health control to understand the impact of frequent journeys on epidemics. We stress that a new framework of modelling that takes a traveller's viewpoint is needed. Such integrated travel network (ITN) model should incorporate the diversity among links as dictated by the distances between cities and different speeds of different modes of transportation, diversity among nodes as dictated by the population and the ease of travelling due to infrastructures and economic development of a city, and round-trip journeys to targeted destinations via the paths of shortest travel times typical of human journeys. An example is constructed for 116 cities in China with populations over one million that are connected by high-speed train services and highways. Epidemic spread on the constructed network is studied. It is revealed both numerically and theoretically that the traveling speed and frequency are important factors of epidemic spreading. Depending on the infection rate, increasing the traveling speed would result in either an enhanced or suppressed epidemic, while increasing the traveling frequency enhances the epidemic spreading.},

  abstract        = {Ecological history may be an important driver of epidemics and disease emergence. We evaluated the role of history and two related concepts, the evolution of epidemics and the burn-in period required for fitting a model to epidemic observations, for the U.S. soybean rust epidemic (caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi). This disease allows evaluation of replicate epidemics because the pathogen reinvades the United States each year. We used a new maximum likelihood estimation approach for fitting the network model based on observed U.S. epidemics. We evaluated the model burn-in period by comparing model fit based on each combination of other years of observation. When the miss error rates were weighted by 0.9 and false alarm error rates by 0.1, the mean error rate did decline, for most years, as more years were used to construct models. Models based on observations in years closer in time to the season being estimated gave lower miss error rates for later epidemic years. The weighted mean error rate was lower in backcasting than in forecasting, reflecting how the epidemic had evolved. Ongoing epidemic evolution, and potential model failure, can occur because of changes in climate, host resistance and spatial patterns, or pathogen evolution.},

The measures, usually consisting of a combination of border entry/exit screening, quarantine, isolation, and communications, were resource intensive, and modeling and observational studies indicate that border screening is not effective at detecting infectious persons. Moreover, border screening has high opportunity costs, financially and in terms of the use of scarce public health staff resources during a time of high need. We discuss the border-screening experiences with SARS and influenza and propose an approach to decision-making for future pandemics. We conclude that outbreak-associated communications for travelers at border entry points, together with effective communication with clinicians and more effective disease control measures in the community, may be a more effective approach to the international control of communicable diseases.},

An extensive analysis of our simulation results reveals that immunization algorithms, which efficiently reduce the nodes' average degree, are more effective in the mitigation of weak and slow epidemics, whereas vaccination strategies that fragment networks to small components, are more successful in suppressing severe epidemics.},

  abstract        = {Since the outbreak of pandemics, influenza has caused extensive attention in the field of public health. It is actually hard to distinguish what is the most effective method to control the influenza transmission within airport terminal. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the influences of passenger source, immunity difference and social relation structure on the influenza transmission in terminal. A method combining hierarchical structure of personal contact network with agent-based SEIR model was proposed to analyze the characteristics of influenza diffusion within terminal. Based on the spatial distance between individuals, the hierarchical structure of personal contact network was defined to construct a complex relationship of passengers in the real world. Moreover, the agent-based SEIR model was improved by considering the individual level of influenza spread characteristics. To evaluate the method, this process was fused in simulation based on the constructed personal contact network. In the terminal we investigated, personal contact network was defined by following four layers: social relation structure, procedure partition, procedure area, and the whole terminal. With the growing of layer, the degree distribution curves move right. The value of degree distribution p(k) reached a peak at a specific value, and then back down. Besides, with the increase of layer α, the clustering coefficients presented a tendency to exponential decay. Based on the influenza transmission experiments, the main infected areas were concluded when considering different factors. Moreover, partition of passenger sources was found to impact a lot in departure, while social relation structure imposed a great influence in arrival. Besides, immunity difference exerted no obvious effect on the spread of influenza in the transmission process both in departure and arrival. The proposed method is efficient to reproduce the evolution process of influenza transmission, and exhibits various roles of each factor in different processes, also better reflects the effect of passenger topological character on influenza spread. It contributes to proposing effective influenza measures by airport relevant department and improving the efficiency and ability of epidemic prevention on the public health.},

As an application, six different screening strategies are explored to examine the impacts of screening on the control of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. We find that it is crucial to screen travelers from and to high-risk patches, and it is not necessary to implement screening in all connected patches, and both the dispersal rates and the successful detection rate of screening play an important role on determining an effective and practical screening strategy.},

In Pakistan, dengue has been endemic for decades in the southern port city of Karachi, but large epidemics in the northeast have emerged only since 2011. Pakistan is therefore representative of many countries on the verge of countrywide endemic dengue transmission, where prevention, surveillance, and preparedness are key priorities in previously dengue-free regions. We analyze spatially explicit dengue case data from a large outbreak in Pakistan in 2013 and compare the dynamics of the epidemic to an epidemiological model of dengue virus transmission based on climate and mobility data from ∼40 million mobile phone subscribers. We find that mobile phone-based mobility estimates predict the geographic spread and timing of epidemics in both recently epidemic and emerging locations. We combine transmission suitability maps with estimates of seasonal dengue virus importation to generate fine-scale dynamic risk maps with direct application to dengue containment and epidemic preparedness.},

  abstract        = {The study of recurrent epidemic outbreaks has been attracting great attention for decades, but its underlying mechanism is still under debate. Based on a large number of real data from different cities, we find that besides the seasonal periodic outbreaks of influenza, there are also non-periodic outbreaks, i.e. non-seasonal or non-annual behaviors. To understand how the non-periodicity shows up, we present a network model of SIRS epidemic with both time-dependent infection rate and a small possibility of persistent epidemic seeds, representing the influences from the larger annual variation of environment and the infection generated spontaneously in nature, respectively. Our numerical simulations reveal that the model can reproduce the non-periodic outbreaks of recurrent epidemics with the main features of real influenza data. Further, we find that the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic depend not only on the infection rate but also on the density of susceptible agents, indicating that they are both the necessary conditions for the recurrent epidemic patterns with non-periodicity. A theoretical analysis based on Markov dynamics is presented to explain the numerical results. This finding may be of significance to the control of recurrent epidemics.},

Although the SIR model has recently been studied in a multilayer networks configuration, in almost all the research the isolation of infected individuals is disregarded. Hence we focus our study in an epidemic model in a two-layer network, and we use an isolation parameter w to measure the effect of quarantining infected individuals from both layers during an isolation period tw. We call this process the Susceptible-Infected-Isolated-Recovered (SIIR) model. Using the framework of link percolation we find that isolation increases the critical epidemic threshold of the disease because the time in which infection can spread is reduced. In this scenario we find that this threshold increases with w and tw. When the isolation period is maximum there is a critical threshold for w above which the disease never becomes an epidemic. We simulate the process and find an excellent agreement with the theoretical results.},

We did a population-based cross-sectional study of applicants for long-term visas who were screened for tuberculosis before entry to the UK in a pilot programme between Oct 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2013. The primary outcome was prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. We used Poisson regression to estimate crude prevalence and created a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for the primary outcome. 476 455 visa applicants were screened, and the crude prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis was 92 (95% CI 84-101) per 100 000 individuals. After adjustment for age and sex, factors that were strongly associated with an increased risk of bacteriologically confirmed disease at pre-entry screening were self-report of close or household contact with an individual with tuberculosis (odds ratio 11·6, 95% CI 7·0-19·3; p<0·0001) and being an applicant for settlement and dependant visas (1·3, 1·0-1·6; p=0·0203). Migrants reporting contact with an individual with tuberculosis had the highest risk of tuberculosis at pre-entry screening. To tackle this disease burden in migrants, a comprehensive and collaborative approach is needed between countries with pre-entry screening programmes, health services in the countries of origin and migration, national tuberculosis control programmes, and international public health bodies.

To support public health readiness, we aim to identify regions and times where the potential health, economic, and social effects from Zika virus are greatest, focusing on resource-limited countries in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. Our model combined transportation network analysis, ecological modelling of mosquito occurrences, and vector competence for flavivirus transmission, using data from the International Air Transport Association, entomological observations from Zika's primary vector species, and climate conditions using WorldClim. We overlaid monthly flows of airline travellers arriving to Africa and the Asia-Pacific region from areas of the Americas suitable for year-round transmission of Zika virus with monthly maps of climatic suitability for mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus within Africa and the Asia-Pacific region. An estimated 2·6 billion people live in areas of Africa and the Asia-Pacific region where the presence of competent mosquito vectors and suitable climatic conditions could support local transmission of Zika virus. Countries with large volumes of travellers arriving from Zika virus-affected areas of the Americas and large populations at risk of mosquito-borne Zika virus infection include India (67 422 travellers arriving per year; 1·2 billion residents in potential Zika transmission areas), China (238 415 travellers; 242 million residents), Indonesia (13 865 travellers; 197 million residents), Philippines (35 635 travellers; 70 million residents), and Thailand (29 241 travellers; 59 million residents). Many countries across Africa and the Asia-Pacific region are vulnerable to Zika virus. Strategic use of available health and human resources is essential to prevent or mitigate the health, economic, and social consequences of Zika virus, especially in resource-limited countries.

The models are denoted SIR-[Formula: see text] and SEIR-[Formula: see text], and we focus attention on the early stages of an outbreak, where we derive the expressions for the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the expected degree of the infectious nodes [Formula: see text] using two different approximation approaches. The first approach approximates the early spread of an epidemic by a branching process, whereas the second one uses pair approximation. The expressions are compared with the corresponding empirical means obtained from stochastic simulations of SIR-[Formula: see text] and SEIR-[Formula: see text] epidemics on Poisson and scale-free networks. Without rewiring of exposed nodes, the two approaches predict the same epidemic threshold and the same [Formula: see text] for both types of epidemics, the latter being very close to the mean degree obtained from simulated epidemics over Poisson networks. Above the epidemic threshold, pairwise models overestimate the value of [Formula: see text] computed from simulations, which turns out to be very close to the one predicted by the branching process approximation. When exposed individuals also rewire with [Formula: see text] (perhaps unaware of being infected), the two approaches give different epidemic thresholds, with the branching process approximation being more in agreement with simulations.},

SARS caused a pandemic that spread throughout mainland China for 7 months, infecting 5318 persons in 194 administrative regions. Using detailed mainland China epidemiological data, we study spatiotemporal aspects of this person-to-person contagious disease and simulate its spatiotemporal transmission dynamics via the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) method. The BME reveals that SARS outbreaks show autocorrelation within certain spatial and temporal distances. We use BME to fit a theoretical covariance model that has a sine hole spatial component and exponential temporal component and obtain the weights of geographical and temporal autocorrelation factors. Using the covariance model, SARS dynamics were estimated and simulated under the most probable conditions. Our study suggests that SARS transmission varies in its epidemiological characteristics and SARS outbreak distributions exhibit palpable clusters on both spatial and temporal scales. In addition, the BME modelling demonstrates that SARS transmission features are affected by spatial heterogeneity, so we analyze potential causes. This may benefit epidemiological control of pandemic infectious diseases.},

  abstract        = {There is a long tradition of using mathematical models to generate insights into the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and assess the potential impact of different intervention strategies. The increasing use of mathematical models for epidemic forecasting has highlighted the importance of designing reliable models that capture the baseline transmission characteristics of specific pathogens and social contexts. More refined models are needed however, in particular to account for variation in the early growth dynamics of real epidemics and to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms at play. Here, we review recent progress on modeling and characterizing early epidemic growth patterns from infectious disease outbreak data, and survey the types of mathematical formulations that are most useful for capturing a diversity of early epidemic growth profiles, ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth dynamics. Specifically, we review mathematical models that incorporate spatial details or realistic population mixing structures, including meta-population models, individual-based network models, and simple SIR-type models that incorporate the effects of reactive behavior changes or inhomogeneous mixing. In this process, we also analyze simulation data stemming from detailed large-scale agent-based models previously designed and calibrated to study how realistic social networks and disease transmission characteristics shape early epidemic growth patterns, general transmission dynamics, and control of international disease emergencies such as the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa.},

  volume          = {13},
  abstract        = {Early estimates of the transmission potential of emerging and re-emerging infections are increasingly used to inform public health authorities on the level of risk posed by outbreaks. Existing methods to estimate the reproduction number generally assume exponential growth in case incidence in the first few disease generations, before susceptible depletion sets in. In reality, outbreaks can display subexponential (i.e. polynomial) growth in the first few disease generations, owing to clustering in contact patterns, spatial effects, inhomogeneous mixing, reactive behaviour changes or other mechanisms. Here, we introduce the generalized growth model to characterize the early growth profile of outbreaks and estimate the effective reproduction number, with no need for explicit assumptions about the shape of epidemic growth. We demonstrate this phenomenological approach using analytical results and simulations from mechanistic models, and provide validation against a range of empirical disease datasets. Our results suggest that subexponential growth in the early phase of an epidemic is the rule rather the exception. Mechanistic simulations show that slight modifications to the classical susceptible-infectious-removed model result in subexponential growth, and in turn a rapid decline in the reproduction number within three to five disease generations. For empirical outbreaks, the generalized-growth model consistently outperforms the exponential model for a variety of directly and indirectly transmitted diseases datasets (pandemic influenza, measles, smallpox, bubonic plague, cholera, foot-and-mouth disease, HIV/AIDS and Ebola) with model estimates supporting subexponential growth dynamics. The rapid decline in effective reproduction number predicted by analytical results and observed in real and synthetic datasets within three to five disease generations contrasts with the expectation of invariant reproduction number in epidemics obeying exponential growth. The generalized-growth concept also provides us a compelling argument for the unexpected extinction of certain emerging disease outbreaks during the early ascending phase. Overall, our approach promotes a more reliable and data-driven characterization of the early epidemic phase, which is important for accurate estimation of the reproduction number and prediction of disease impact.},

  abstract        = {Phylogenetic analysis is now an important tool in the study of viral outbreaks. It can reconstruct epidemic history when surveillance epidemiology data are sparse, and can indicate transmission linkages among infections that may not otherwise be evident. However, a remaining challenge is to develop an analytical framework that can test hypotheses about the effect of environmental variables on pathogen spatial spread. Recent phylogeographic approaches can reconstruct the history of virus dispersal from sampled viral genomes and infer the locations of ancestral infections. Such methods provide a unique source of spatio-temporal information, and are exploited here. We present and apply a new statistical framework that combines genomic and geographic data to test the impact of environmental variables on the mode and tempo of pathogen dispersal during emerging epidemics. First, the spatial history of an emerging pathogen is estimated using standard phylogeographic methods. The inferred dispersal path for each phylogenetic lineage is then assigned a "weight" using environmental data (e.g. altitude, land cover). Next, tests measure the association between each environmental variable and lineage movement. A randomisation procedure is used to assess statistical confidence and we validate this approach using simulated data. We apply our new framework to a set of gene sequences from an epidemic of rabies virus in North American raccoons. We test the impact of six different environmental variables on this epidemic and demonstrate that elevation is associated with a slower rabies spread in a natural population. This study shows that it is possible to integrate genomic and environmental data in order to test hypotheses concerning the mode and tempo of virus dispersal during emerging epidemics.},

  abstract        = {Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 and has since spread to 26 countries. All cases reported so far have either been in the Middle East or linked to the region through passenger air travel, with the largest outbreak outside KSA occurring in South Korea. Further international spread is likely due to the high travel volumes of global travel, as well as the occurrence of large annual mass gathering such as the Haj and Umrah pilgrimages that take place in the region. In this study, a transport network modelling framework was used to quantify the risk of MERS-CoV spreading internationally via air travellers. All regions connected to MERS-CoV affected countries via air travel are considered, and the countries at highest risk of travel-related importations of MERS-CoV were identified, ranked and compared with actual spread of MERS cases. The model identifies all countries that have previously reported a travel acquired case to be in the top 50 at-risk countries. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are the highest risk countries which have yet to report a case, and should be prepared for the possibility of (pilgrims and general) travellers returning infected with MERS-CoV. In addition, the UK, Egypt, Turkey and the USA are at risk of more cases. We have demonstrated a risk-analysis approach, using travel patterns, to prioritize countries at highest risk for MERS-CoV importations. In order to prevent global outbreaks such as the one seen in South Korea, it is critical for high-risk countries to be prepared and have appropriate screening and triage protocols in place to identify travel-related cases of MERS-CoV. The results from the model can be used by countries to prioritize their airport and hospital screening and triage protocols.},

  abstract        = {Epidemics of water-borne infections often follow natural disasters and extreme weather events that disrupt water management processes. The impact of such epidemics may be reduced by deployment of transmission control facilities such as clinics or decontamination plants. Here we use a relatively simple mathematical model to examine how demographic and environmental heterogeneities, population behaviour, and behavioural change in response to the provision of facilities, combine to determine the optimal configurations of limited numbers of facilities to reduce epidemic size, and endemic prevalence. We show that, if the presence of control facilities does not affect behaviour, a good general rule for responsive deployment to minimise epidemic size is to place them in exactly the locations where they will directly benefit the most people. However, if infected people change their behaviour to seek out treatment then the deployment of facilities offering treatment can lead to complex effects that are difficult to foresee. So careful mathematical analysis is the only way to get a handle on the optimal deployment. Behavioural changes in response to control facilities can also lead to critical facility numbers at which there is a radical change in the optimal configuration. So sequential improvement of a control strategy by adding facilities to an existing optimal configuration does not always produce another optimal configuration. We also show that the pre-emptive deployment of control facilities has conflicting effects. The configurations that minimise endemic prevalence are very different to those that minimise epidemic size. So cost-benefit analysis of strategies to manage endemic prevalence must factor in the frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters.},

  abstract        = {There has been growing interest in exploring the interplay between epidemic spreading with human response, since it is natural for people to take various measures when they become aware of epidemics. As a proper way to describe the multiple connections among people in reality, multiplex network, a set of nodes interacting through multiple sets of edges, has attracted much attention. In this paper, to explore the coupled dynamical processes, a multiplex network with two layers is built. Specifically, the information spreading layer is a time varying network generated by the activity driven model, while the contagion layer is a static network. We extend the microscopic Markov chain approach to derive the epidemic threshold of the model. Compared with extensive Monte Carlo simulations, the method shows high accuracy for the prediction of the epidemic threshold. Besides, taking different spreading models of awareness into consideration, we explored the interplay between epidemic spreading with awareness spreading. The results show that the awareness spreading can not only enhance the epidemic threshold but also reduce the prevalence of epidemics. When the spreading of awareness is defined as susceptible-infected-susceptible model, there exists a critical value where the dynamical process on the awareness layer can control the onset of epidemics; while if it is a threshold model, the epidemic threshold emerges an abrupt transition with the local awareness ratio α approximating 0.5. Moreover, we also find that temporal changes in the topology hinder the spread of awareness which directly affect the epidemic threshold, especially when the awareness layer is threshold model. Given that the threshold model is a widely used model for social contagion, this is an important and meaningful result. Our results could also lead to interesting future research about the different time-scales of structural changes in multiplex networks.},

It is interesting that the threshold value R0 bears no relation to the functional form of the nonlinear incidence rate and degree-dependent birth. Furthermore, by applying an iteration scheme and the theory of cooperative system respectively, we obtain sufficient conditions under which the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Our results improve and generalize some known results. To illustrate the theoretical results, the corresponding numerical simulations are also given.},

  abstract     = {Models of the spread of disease in a population often make the simplifying assumption that the population is homogeneously mixed, or is divided into homogeneously mixed compartments. However, human populations have complex structures formed by social contacts, which can have a significant influence on the rate of epidemic spread. Contact network models capture this structure by explicitly representing each contact which could possibly lead to a transmission. We developed a method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a likelihood-free inference strategy, for estimating structural parameters of the contact network underlying an observed viral phylogeny. The method combines adaptive sequential Monte Carlo for ABC, Gillespie simulation for propagating epidemics though networks, and a kernel-based tree similarity score. We used the method to fit the Barabási-Albert network model to simulated transmission trees, and also applied it to viral phylogenies estimated from ten published HIV sequence datasets. This model incorporates a feature called preferential attachment (PA), whereby individuals with more existing contacts accumulate new contacts at a higher rate. On simulated data, we found that the strength of PA and the number of infected nodes in the network can often be accurately estimated. On the other hand, the mean degree of the network, as well as the total number of nodes, was not estimable with ABC. We observed sub-linear PA power in all datasets, as well as higher PA power in networks of injection drug users. These results underscore the importance of considering contact structures when performing phylodynamic inference. Our method offers the potential to quantitatively investigate the contact network structure underlying viral epidemics.},

  abstract        = {Infectious diseases such as SARS and H1N1 can significantly impact people's lives and cause severe social and economic damages. Recent outbreaks have stressed the urgency of effective research on the dynamics of infectious disease spread. However, it is difficult to predict when and where outbreaks may emerge and how infectious diseases spread because many factors affect their transmission, and some of them may be unknown. One feasible means to promptly detect an outbreak and track the progress of disease spread is to implement surveillance systems in regional or national health and medical centres. The accumulated surveillance data, including temporal, spatial, clinical, and demographic information can provide valuable information that can be exploited to better understand and model the dynamics of infectious disease spread. The aim of this work is to develop and empirically evaluate a stochastic model that allows the investigation of transmission patterns of infectious diseases in heterogeneous populations. We test the proposed model on simulation data and apply it to the surveillance data from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong. In the simulation experiment, our model achieves high accuracy in parameter estimation (less than 10.0 % mean absolute percentage error). In terms of the forward prediction of case incidence, the mean absolute percentage errors are 17.3 % for the simulation experiment and 20.0 % for the experiment on the real surveillance data. We propose a stochastic model to study the dynamics of infectious disease spread in heterogeneous populations from temporal-spatial surveillance data. The proposed model is evaluated using both simulated data and the real data from the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Hong Kong and achieves acceptable prediction accuracy. We believe that our model can provide valuable insights for public health authorities to predict the effect of disease spread and analyse its underlying factors and to guide new control efforts.},

While influenza vaccines are the single most effective intervention to reduce influenza morbidity and mortality, there is considerable debate surrounding the merits and consequences of repeated seasonal vaccination. Here, we describe a two-season influenza epidemic contact network model and use it to demonstrate that increasing the level of continuity in vaccination across seasons reduces the burden on public health. We show that revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate not only because it reduces the overall number of susceptible individuals, but also because it better protects highly connected individuals, who would otherwise make a disproportionately large contribution to influenza transmission. We also demonstrate that our results hold on an empirical contact network, in the presence of assortativity in vaccination status, and are robust for a range of vaccine coverage and efficacy levels. Our work contributes a population-level perspective to debates about the merits of repeated influenza vaccination and advocates for public health policy to incorporate individual vaccine histories.},

Without access to a person-to-person contact graph, it is sensible to analyze these data as homogenous within each areal unit and to use the spatial graph to derive a contact structure. The spatio-temporal partition is fine, and the counts of new infections at each location at each time are sparse. Therefore, we propose a spatial compartmental epidemic model with general latent time distributions (spatial PS SEIR) that is capable of smoothing the contact structure, while accounting for spatial heterogeneity in the mixing process between locations. Because the model is an extension of the PS SEIR model, it simultaneously handles non-exponentially distributed latent and infectious time distributions. The analysis within focuses on the progression of the disease over both space and time while assessing the impact of a large proportion of the infected people dispersing at the same time because of spring break and the impact of public awareness on the spread of the mumps epidemic. We found that the effect of spring break increased the mixing rate in the population and that the spatial transmission of the disease spreads across multiple conduits.},

  abstract        = {Uncertainty of pandemic influenza viruses continue to cause major preparedness challenges for public health policymakers. Decisions to mitigate influenza outbreaks often involve tradeoff between the social costs of interventions (e.g., school closure) and the cost of uncontrolled spread of the virus. To achieve a balance, policymakers must assess the impact of mitigation strategies once an outbreak begins and the virus characteristics are known. Agent-based (AB) simulation is a useful tool for building highly granular disease spread models incorporating the epidemiological features of the virus as well as the demographic and social behavioral attributes of tens of millions of affected people. Such disease spread models provide excellent basis on which various mitigation strategies can be tested, before they are adopted and implemented by the policymakers. However, to serve as a testbed for the mitigation strategies, the AB simulation models must be operational. A critical requirement for operational AB models is that they are amenable for quick and simple calibration. The calibration process works as follows: the AB model accepts information available from the field and uses those to update its parameters such that some of its outputs in turn replicate the field data. In this paper, we present our epidemiological model based calibration methodology that has a low computational complexity and is easy to interpret. Our model accepts a field estimate of the basic reproduction number, and then uses it to update (calibrate) the infection probabilities in a way that its effect combined with the effects of the given virus epidemiology, demographics, and social behavior results in an infection pattern yielding a similar value of the basic reproduction number. We evaluate the accuracy of the calibration methodology by applying it for an AB simulation model mimicking a regional outbreak in the US. The calibrated model is shown to yield infection patterns closely replicating the input estimates of the basic reproduction number. The calibration method is also tested to replicate an initial infection incidence trend for a H1N1 outbreak like that of 2009.},

  abstract        = {In 2012, the United Kingdom (UK) Government announced that the new entrant screening for active tuberculosis (TB) in Heathrow and Gatwick airports would end. Our study objective was to estimate screening yield and diagnostic accuracy, and identify those at risk of active TB after entry. We designed a retrospective cohort study and linked new entrants screened from June 2009 to September 2010 through probabilistic matching with UK Enhanced TB Surveillance (ETS) data (June 2009 to December 2010). Yield was the proportion of cases reported to ETS within three months of airport screening in the screened population. To estimate screening diagnostic accuracy we assessed sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values. Through Poisson regression we identified groups at increased risk of TB diagnosis after entry. We identified 200,199 screened entrants, of these 59 had suspected TB at screening and were reported within 3 months to ETS (yield = 0.03 %). Sensitivity was 26 %; specificity was 99.7 %; positive predictive value was 13.2 %; negative predictive value was 99.9 %. Overall, 350 entrants were reported in ETS. Persons from countries with annual TB incidence higher than 150 cases per 100,000 population and refugees and asylum seekers were at increased risk of TB diagnosis after entry (population attributable risk 77 and 3 % respectively). Airport screening has very low screening yields, sensitivity and positive predictive value. New entrants coming from countries with annual TB incidence higher than 150 per 100,000 population, refugees and asylum seekers should be prioritised at pre- or post-entry screening.},

  abstract        = {RNA viruses usually consist of mutant spectra because of high error rates of viral RNA polymerases. Growth competition occurs among different viral variants, and the fittest clones predominate under given conditions. Individual variants, however, may not be entirely independent of each other, and internal interactions within mutant spectra can occur. Examples of cooperative and interfering interactions that exert enhancing and suppressing effects on replication of the wild-type virus, respectively, have been described, but their underlying mechanisms have not been well defined. It was recently found that the cooperation between wild-type and variant measles virus genomes produces a new phenotype through the heterooligomer formation of a viral protein. This observation provides a molecular mechanism underlying cooperative interactions within mutant spectra. Careful attention to individual sequences, in addition to consensus sequences, may disclose further examples of internal interactions within mutant spectra.},

  abstract        = {Infectious diseases are a threat to human health and a hindrance to societal development. Consequently, the spread of diseases in both time and space has been widely studied, revealing the different types of spatial patterns. Transitions between patterns are an emergent property in spatial epidemics that can serve as a potential trend indicator of disease spread. Despite the usefulness of such an indicator, attempts to systematize the topic of pattern transitions have been few and far between. We present a mini-review on pattern transitions in spatial epidemics, describing the types of transitions and their underlying mechanisms. We show that pattern transitions relate to the complexity of spatial epidemics by, for example, being accompanied with phenomena such as coherence resonance and cyclic evolution. The results presented herein provide valuable insights into disease prevention and control, and may even be applicable outside epidemiology, including other branches of medical science, ecology, quantitative finance, and elsewhere.},

The oscillatory behaviour in the stochastic simulations is studied using Fourier analysis, as well as through analysing the exact master equations of the stochastic model. By going beyond simply comparing simulation results to mean-field models, our approach yields deeper insights into the observed phenomena and help better understand and map out the limitations of mean-field models.},

  abstract        = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in China in 2002, and it spread to 26 provinces in mainland China and 32 countries across five continents in a matter of months. This outbreak resulted in 774 deaths. However, the spatial features and potential determinants of SARS input-output flows remain unclear. We used an adjusted spatial interaction model to examine the spatial effects and potential factors associated with SARS input-output flows. The presence of origin-based spatial dependence positively affected SARS input-output flows from the neighbours of the origin regions. Two components of the input-output flows, migrant and hospitalization flows, exhibited distinctive features. The origin-based and destination-based spatial dependence positively affected migrant flows (i.e., due to those seeking jobs) from the neighbours of origin and destination locations. Similarly, the destination-based spatial dependence also positively affected hospitalization flows (i.e., due to those seeking treatment) from the neighbours of destination regions. However, the origin-to-destination based spatial dependence negatively affected hospitalisation flows from the neighbours of origin-to-destination regions. The direct effects accounted for 78% of the SARS input-output flows, which was 3.56-fold greater than the indirect effects. Differences in regional income drove the SARS input-output flows. Therefore, urban income had a positive effect, whereas rural income had a negative effect. Total interregional flows increased by 3.54% with a 1% increase in urban income, and intraregional flows increased by 8.35%. In contrast, the total interregional flows decreased by 3.38% with a 1% increase in rural income, and intraregional flows declined by 2.29%. Railway capacity, per person gross domestic product (PGDP), urban rate and the law of distance decay also affected the input-output flows. Our results confirm that the SARS input-output flows presented significant geographic spatial heterogeneity and spatial effects. Income differences were the major cause of the flows between pairs of regions. Railway capacity, PGDP, and urban rate also played important roles. These findings provide valuable information for the Chinese government to control the future spread of nationwide epidemics.},

The spread of the disease has a serious impact on poultry production especially among rural households with backyard chickens. The movements and activities of chicken traders result in the spread of the disease through traditional trade networks. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of avian influenza in the traditional trade network in Phitsanulok Province, Thailand. We also propose an individual-based model with intervention strategies to control the spread of the disease. We found that the dynamics of the disease mainly depend on the transmission probability and the virus inactivation period. This study also illustrates the appropriate virus disinfection period and the target for intervention strategies on traditional trade network. The results suggest that good hygiene and cleanliness among household traders and trader of trader areas and ensuring that any equipment used is clean can lead to a decrease in transmission and final epidemic size. These results may be useful to epidemiologists, researchers, and relevant authorities in understanding the spread of avian influenza through traditional trade networks.},

By using the block heterogeneous mean-field approach, a series of discrete-time dynamical models is formulated and the condition for epidemic outbreaks can be established which is shown to be not only dependent on the network structure but also closely related to the immunization control parameters. Results show that increasing the immunization strength can effectively raise the epidemic threshold, which is different from the predictions obtained through the susceptible-infected-susceptible network framework, where epidemic threshold is independent of the vaccination strength. Furthermore, a significant decrease of vaccine use to control the infectious disease is observed for the local vaccination strategy, which shows the promising applications of the local immunization programs to disease control while calls for accurate local information during the process of disease outbreak.},

  abstract        = {In epidemiological modelling, dynamics on networks, and, in particular, adaptive and heterogeneous networks have recently received much interest. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a previously proposed model that combines heterogeneity in the individuals with adaptive rewiring of the network structure in response to a disease. We show that in this model, qualitative changes in the dynamics occur in two phase transitions. In a macroscopic description, one of these corresponds to a local bifurcation, whereas the other one corresponds to a non-local heteroclinic bifurcation. This model thus provides a rare example of a system where a phase transition is caused by a non-local bifurcation, while both micro- and macro-level dynamics are accessible to mathematical analysis. The bifurcation points mark the onset of a behaviour that we call network inoculation. In the respective parameter region, exposure of the system to a pathogen will lead to an outbreak that collapses but leaves the network in a configuration where the disease cannot reinvade, despite every agent returning to the susceptible class. We argue that this behaviour and the associated phase transitions can be expected to occur in a wide class of models of sufficient complexity.},

By identifying the optimal granularity for a given disease and host population, and matching surveillance and prediction efforts to this scale, response to emergent and recurrent outbreaks can be improved. Here we explore how granularity and representation of spatial structure affect influenza forecast accuracy within New York City. We develop network models at the borough and neighborhood levels, and use them in conjunction with surveillance data and a data assimilation method to forecast influenza activity. These forecasts are compared to an alternate system that predicts influenza for each borough or neighborhood in isolation. At the borough scale, influenza epidemics are highly synchronous despite substantial differences in intensity, and inclusion of network connectivity among boroughs generally improves forecast accuracy. At the neighborhood scale, we observe much greater spatial heterogeneity among influenza outbreaks including substantial differences in local outbreak timing and structure; however, inclusion of the network model structure generally degrades forecast accuracy. One notable exception is that local outbreak onset, particularly when signal is modest, is better predicted with the network model. These findings suggest that observation and forecast at sub-municipal scales within New York City provides richer, more discriminant information on influenza incidence, particularly at the neighborhood scale where greater heterogeneity exists, and that the spatial spread of influenza among localities can be forecast.},

  abstract        = {One common observation in infectious diseases caused by multi-strain pathogens is that both the incidence of all infections and the relative fraction of infection with each strain oscillate with time (i.e., so-called Epidemic cycling). Many different mechanisms have been proposed for the pervasive nature of epidemic cycling. Nevertheless, the two facts that people contact each other through a network rather than following a simple mass-action law and most infectious diseases involve multiple strains have not been considered together for their influence on the epidemic cycling. To demonstrate how the structural contacts among people influences the dynamical patterns of multi-strain pathogens, we investigate a two strain epidemic model in a network where every individual randomly contacts with a fixed number of other individuals. The standard pair approximation is applied to describe the changing numbers of individuals in different infection states and contact pairs. We show that spatial correlation due to contact network and interactions between strains through both ecological interference and immune response interact to generate epidemic cycling. Compared to one strain epidemic model, the two strain model presented here can generate epidemic cycling within a much wider parameter range that covers many infectious diseases. Our results suggest that co-circulation of multiple strains within a contact network provides an explanation for epidemic cycling.},

The continuing introductions of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels, the subsequent travel-related viral spread, the unprecedented nosocomial outbreaks and the high case-fatality rates highlight the need for prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Scientific advancements since the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pandemic allowed for rapid progress in our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and the development of therapeutics. In this Review, we detail our present understanding of the transmission and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and discuss the current state of development of measures to combat emerging coronaviruses.},

  abstract        = {Host-level influenza virus-respiratory pathogen interactions are often reported. Although the exact biological mechanisms involved remain unelucidated, secondary bacterial infections are known to account for a large part of the influenza-associated burden, during seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. Those interactions probably impact the microorganisms' transmission dynamics and the influenza public health toll. Mathematical models have been widely used to examine influenza epidemics and the public health impact of control measures. However, most influenza models overlooked interaction phenomena and ignored other co-circulating pathogens. Herein, we describe a novel agent-based model (ABM) of influenza transmission during interaction with another respiratory pathogen. The interacting microorganism can persist in the population year round (endemic type, e.g. respiratory bacteria) or cause short-term annual outbreaks (epidemic type, e.g. winter respiratory viruses). The agent-based framework enables precise formalization of the pathogens' natural histories and complex within-host phenomena. As a case study, this ABM is applied to the well-known influenza virus-pneumococcus interaction, for which several biological mechanisms have been proposed. Different mechanistic hypotheses of interaction are simulated and the resulting virus-induced pneumococcal infection (PI) burden is assessed. This ABM generates realistic data for both pathogens in terms of weekly incidences of PI cases, carriage rates, epidemic size and epidemic timing. Notably, distinct interaction hypotheses resulted in different transmission patterns and led to wide variations of the associated PI burden. Interaction strength was also of paramount importance: when influenza increased pneumococcus acquisition, 4-27% of the PI burden during the influenza season was attributable to influenza depending on the interaction strength. This open-source ABM provides new opportunities to investigate influenza interactions from a theoretical point of view and could easily be extended to other pathogens. It provides a unique framework to generate in silico data for different scenarios and thereby test mechanistic hypotheses.},

(2) The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a new corona virus isolated for the first time in a patients who died of severe lower respiratory tract infection in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) in June 2012 (Zaki et al. 2012). The disease has been named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and it has remained on the radar of global public health authorities because of recurrent nosocomial and community outbreaks, and its association with severe disease and high mortality rates (Assiri et al. 2013a; Al-Abdallat et al. 2014; Memish et al. 2013a; Oboho et al. 2015; The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group 2013; Cotten et al. 2013a; Assiri et al. 2013b; Memish et al. 2013b; Azhar et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015; Hui et al. 2015a). Cases of MERS have been reported from all continents and have been linked with travel to the Middle East (Hui et al. 2015a; WHO 2015c). The World Health Organization (WHO) have held nine meetings of the Emergency Committee (EC) convened by the Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) regarding MERS-CoV (WHO 2015c). There is wishful anticipation in the political and scientific communities that MERS-CoV like SARS-CoV will disappear with time. However it's been nearly 4 years since the first discovery of MERS-CoV, and MERS cases continue to be reported throughout the year from the Middle East (WHO 2015c). There is a large MERS-CoV camel reservoir, and there is no specific treatment or vaccine (Zumla et al. 2015a). With 10 million people visiting Saudi Arabia every year for Umrah and/or Hajj, the potential risk of global spread is ever present (Memish et al. 2014a; McCloskey et al. 2014; Al-Tawfiq et al. 2014a).},

  abstract        = {Recent years have seen a large amount of interest in epidemics on networks as a way of representing the complex structure of contacts capable of spreading infections through the modern human population. The configuration model is a popular choice in theoretical studies since it combines the ability to specify the distribution of the number of contacts (degree) with analytical tractability. Here we consider the early real-time behaviour of the Markovian SIR epidemic model on a configuration model network using a multitype branching process. We find closed-form analytic expressions for the mean and variance of the number of infectious individuals as a function of time and the degree of the initially infected individual(s), and write down a system of differential equations for the probability of extinction by time t that are numerically fast compared to Monte Carlo simulation. We show that these quantities are all sensitive to the degree distribution-in particular we confirm that the mean prevalence of infection depends on the first two moments of the degree distribution and the variance in prevalence depends on the first three moments of the degree distribution. In contrast to most existing analytic approaches, the accuracy of these results does not depend on having a large number of infectious individuals, meaning that in the large population limit they would be asymptotically exact even for one initial infectious individual.},

  abstract        = {Seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) is recommended for people with diabetes, but its effectiveness has not been demonstrated. All of the available studies are observational and marred with the healthy vaccine bias, that is, bias resulting from the generally better health behaviours practised by people who choose to be vaccinated against influenza, compared with those who do not. This protocol is intended to study the effectiveness of SIV in people with treated diabetes and simultaneously to control for bias. This case-control study is nested in a historical cohort and is designed to study vaccine effectiveness (VE) assessed by morbidity, mortality and anti-infective drug use. The cohort will comprise a representative sample of health insurance beneficiaries in France and will cover 10 consecutive epidemic seasons. It will include all patients reimbursed three separate times for drugs to treat diabetes. The first study of VE will use reasons for hospitalisation as the primary end point, and the second with the use of neuraminidase inhibitors and of antibiotics as the end points. A case will be defined as any person in the cohort reaching any end point at a given date. The case patient will be matched with the largest possible number of controls (individuals not reaching the end point by this date) according to the propensity score method with an optimal calliper width. A conditional logistic model will be used to estimate ORs to take into account both the matching and the repetition of measurements. The model will be applied separately during and outside of epidemic periods to estimate the residual confounding. The study has been approved by the French Commission on Individual Data Protection and Public Liberties (ref: AT/CPZ/SVT/JB/DP/CR05222O). The study's findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at international conferences and through social media.},

The sufficient condition for the local stability of boundary equilibria and the existence of equilibria are obtained for the case n=2.

Computationally expensive but realistic agent-based simulations and fast but stylized compartmental models are typically used to derive effective vaccine allocation strategies. A detailed comparison of these two approaches, however, is often omitted. We derive age-specific vaccine allocation strategies to mitigate a pandemic influenza outbreak in Seattle by applying derivative-free optimization to an agent-based simulation and also to a compartmental model. We compare the strategies derived by these two approaches under various infection aggressiveness and vaccine coverage scenarios. We observe that both approaches primarily vaccinate school children, however they may allocate the remaining vaccines in different ways. The vaccine allocation strategies derived by using the agent-based simulation are associated with up to 70% decrease in total cost and 34% reduction in the number of infections compared to the strategies derived by using the compartmental model. Nevertheless, the latter approach may still be competitive for very low and/or very high infection aggressiveness. Our results provide insights about potential differences between the vaccine allocation strategies derived by using agent-based simulations and those derived by using compartmental models.},

  abstract        = {The 2004 Mexico Declaration, and subsequent World Health Assembly resolutions, proposed a concerted support for the global development of health policy and systems research (HPSR). This included coordination across partners and advocates for the field of HPSR to monitor the development of the field, while promoting decision-making power and implementing responsibilities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We used a network science approach to examine the structural properties of the HPSR co-authorship network across country economic groups in the PubMed citation database from 1990 to 2015. This analysis summarises the evolution of the publication, co-authorship and citation networks within HPSR. This method allows identification of several features otherwise not apparent. The co-authorship network has evolved steadily from 1990 to 2015 in terms of number of publications, but more importantly, in terms of co-authorship network connectedness. Our analysis suggests that, despite growth in the contribution from low-income countries to HPSR literature, co-authorship remains highly localised. Lower middle-income countries have made progress toward global connectivity through diversified collaboration with various institutions and regions. Global connectivity of the upper middle-income countries (UpperMICs) are almost on par with high-income countries (HICs), indicating the transition of this group of countries toward becoming major contributors to the field. Network analysis allows examination of the connectedness among the HSPR community. Initially (early 1990s), research groups operated almost exclusively independently and, despite the topic being specifically on health policy in LMICs, HICs provided lead authorship. Since the early 1990s, the network has evolved significantly. In the full set analysis (1990-2015), for the first time in HPSR history, more than half of the authors are connected and lead authorship from UpperMICs is on par with that of HICs. This demonstrates the shift in participation and influence toward regions which HPSR primarily serves. Understanding these interactions can highlight the current strengths and future opportunities for identifying new strategies to enhance collaboration and support capacity-building efforts for HPSR.},

  abstract        = {It remains challenging to forecast local, seasonal outbreaks of influenza. The goal of this study was to construct a computational model for predicting influenza incidence. We built two computational models including an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and a hybrid model integrating ARDL with a Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), to assess meteorological factors associated with temporal trends in influenza incidence. The modelling and forecasting performance of these two models were compared using observations collected between 2006 and 2015 in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. In both the training and forecasting stages, the hybrid model showed lower error rates, including a lower residual mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) than the ARDL model. The lag of log-incidence, weekly average barometric pressure, and weekly average of air temperature were 4, 1, and 3, respectively in the ARDL model. The ARDL-GRNN hybrid model can serve as a tool to better understand the characteristics of influenza epidemic, and facilitate their prevention and control.},

  abstract        = {Although Australia is canine rabies free, the Northern Peninsula Area (NPA), Queensland and other northern Australian communities are at risk of an incursion due to proximity to rabies infected islands of Indonesia and existing disease spread pathways. Northern Australia also has large populations of free-roaming domestic dogs, presenting a risk of rabies establishment and maintenance should an incursion occur. Agent-based rabies spread models are being used to predict potential outbreak size and identify effective control strategies to aid incursion preparedness. A key component of these models is knowledge of dog roaming patterns to inform contact rates. However, a comprehensive understanding of how dogs utilise their environment and the heterogeneity of their movements to estimate contact rates is lacking. Using a novel simulation approach - and GPS data collected from 21 free-roaming domestic dogs in the NPA in 2014 and 2016 - we characterised the roaming patterns within this dog population. Multiple subsets from each individual dog's GPS dataset were selected representing different monitoring durations and a utilisation distribution (UD) and derived core (50%) and extended (95%) home ranges (HR) were estimated for each duration. Three roaming patterns were identified, based on changes in mean HR over increased monitoring durations, supported by assessment of maps of daily UDs of each dog. Stay-at-home dogs consolidated their HR around their owner's residence, resulting in a decrease in mean HR (both core and extended) as monitoring duration increased (median peak core and extended HR 0.336 and 3.696ha, respectively). Roamer dogs consolidated their core HR but their extended HR increased with longer monitoring durations, suggesting that their roaming patterns based on place of residence were more variable (median peak core and extended HR 0.391 and 6.049ha, respectively). Explorer dogs demonstrated large variability in their roaming patterns, with both core and extended HR increasing as monitoring duration increased (median peak core and extended HR 0.650 and 9.520ha, respectively). These findings are likely driven by multiple factors that have not been further investigated within this study. Different roaming patterns suggest heterogeneous contact rates between dogs in this population. These findings will be incorporated into disease-spread modelling to more realistically represent roaming patterns and improve model predictions.},

  abstract        = {Today, intellectual property (IP) scholars accept that IP as an approach to information production has serious limits. But what lies beyond IP? A new literature on "intellectual production without IP" (or "IP without IP") has emerged to explore this question, but its examples and explanations have yet to convince skeptics. This Article reorients this new literature via a study of a hard case: a global influenza virus-sharing network that has for decades produced critically important information goods, at significant expense, and in a loose-knit group--all without recourse to IP. I analyze the Network as an example of "open science," a mode of information production that differs strikingly from conventional IP, and yet that successfully produces important scientific goods in response to social need. The theory and example developed here refute the most powerful criticisms of the emerging "IP without IP" literature, and provide a stronger foundation for this important new field. Even where capital costs are high, creation without IP can be reasonably effective in social terms, if it can link sources of funding to reputational and evaluative feedback loops like those that characterize open science. It can also be sustained over time, even by loose-knit groups and where the stakes are high, because organizations and other forms of law can help to stabilize cooperation. I also show that contract law is well suited to modes of information production that rely upon a "supply side" rather than "demand side" model. In its most important instances, "order without IP" is not order without governance, nor order without law. Recognizing this can help us better ground this new field, and better study and support forms of knowledge production that deserve our attention, and that sometimes sustain our very lives.},

  abstract        = {Emerging and re-emerging dengue fever has posed serious problems to public health officials in many tropical and subtropical countries. Continuous traveling in seasonally varying areas makes it more difficult to control the spread of dengue fever. In this work, we consider a two-patch dengue model that can capture the movement of host individuals between and within patches using a residence-time matrix. A previous two-patch dengue model without seasonality is extended by adding host demographics and seasonal forcing in the transmission rates. We investigate the effects of human movement and seasonality on the two-patch dengue transmission dynamics. Motivated by the recent Peruvian dengue data in jungle/rural areas and coast/urban areas, our model mimics the seasonal patterns of dengue outbreaks in two patches. The roles of seasonality and residence-time configurations are highlighted in terms of the seasonal reproduction number and cumulative incidence. Moreover, optimal control theory is employed to identify and evaluate patch-specific control measures aimed at reducing dengue prevalence in the presence of seasonality. Our findings demonstrate that optimal patch-specific control strategies are sensitive to seasonality and residence-time scenarios. Targeting only the jungle (or endemic) is as effective as controlling both patches under weak coupling or symmetric mobility. However, focusing on intervention for the city (or high density areas) turns out to be optimal when two patches are strongly coupled with asymmetric mobility.},

  abstract        = {Since late 2015, an epidemic of yellow fever has caused more than 7334 suspected cases in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including 393 deaths. We sought to understand the spatial spread of this outbreak to optimise the use of the limited available vaccine stock. We jointly analysed datasets describing the epidemic of yellow fever, vector suitability, human demography, and mobility in central Africa to understand and predict the spread of yellow fever virus. We used a standard logistic model to infer the district-specific yellow fever virus infection risk during the course of the epidemic in the region. The early spread of yellow fever virus was characterised by fast exponential growth (doubling time of 5-7 days) and fast spatial expansion (49 districts reported cases after only 3 months) from Luanda, the capital of Angola. Early invasion was positively correlated with high population density (Pearson's r 0·52, 95% CI 0·34-0·66). The further away locations were from Luanda, the later the date of invasion (Pearson's r 0·60, 95% CI 0·52-0·66). In a Cox model, we noted that districts with higher population densities also had higher risks of sustained transmission (the hazard ratio for cases ceasing was 0·74, 95% CI 0·13-0·92 per log-unit increase in the population size of a district). A model that captured human mobility and vector suitability successfully discriminated districts with high risk of invasion from others with a lower risk (area under the curve 0·94, 95% CI 0·92-0·97). If at the start of the epidemic, sufficient vaccines had been available to target 50 out of 313 districts in the area, our model would have correctly identified 27 (84%) of the 32 districts that were eventually affected. Our findings show the contributions of ecological and demographic factors to the ongoing spread of the yellow fever outbreak and provide estimates of the areas that could be prioritised for vaccination, although other constraints such as vaccine supply and delivery need to be accounted for before such insights can be translated into policy.

  abstract        = {Human impact on marine benthic communities has traditionally been assessed using visible morphological traits and has focused on the macrobenthos, whereas the ecologically important organisms of the meio- and microbenthos have received less attention. DNA metabarcoding offers an alternative to this approach and enables a larger fraction of the biodiversity in marine sediments to be monitored in a cost-efficient manner. Although this methodology remains poorly standardised and challenged by biases inherent to rRNA copy number variation, DNA extraction, PCR, and limitations related to taxonomic identification, it has been shown to be semi-quantitative and useful for comparing taxon abundances between samples. Here, we evaluate the effect of replicating genomic DNA extraction in order to counteract small scale spatial heterogeneity and improve diversity and community structure estimates in metabarcoding-based monitoring. For this purpose, we used ten technical replicates from three different marine sediment samples. The effect of sequence depth was also assessed, and in silico pooling of DNA extraction replicates carried out in order to maintain the number of reads constant. Our analyses demonstrated that both sequencing depth and DNA extraction replicates could improve diversity estimates as well as the ability to separate samples with different characteristics. We could not identify a "sufficient" replicate number or sequence depth, where further improvements had a less significant effect. Based on these results, we consider replication an attractive alternative to directly increasing the amount of sample used for DNA extraction and strongly recommend it for future metabarcoding studies and routine assessments of sediment biodiversity.},

Epidemics can be affected by various perturbations and may bounce back to its original state, which is considered resilient. Here, we study the resilience of epidemics on networks, by introducing a different infection rate λ  during SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemic propagation to model perturbations (control state), whereas the infection rate is λ  in the rest of time. Noticing that when λ  is below λ , there is no resilience in the SIS model. Through simulations and theoretical analysis, we find that even for λ  < λ , epidemics eventually could bounce back if the control duration is below a threshold. This critical control time for epidemic resilience, i.e., cd , seems to be predicted by the diameter (d) of the underlying network, with the quantitative relation cd  ∼ d . Our findings can help to design a better mitigation strategy for epidemics.},

We collected contact frequency data in Canada's largest veterans' LTCF by enroling residents and staff into a study that tracked their movements through wireless tags and signal receivers. We analyzed and fitted the data to an agent-based simulation model of influenza infection, and performed Monte-Carlo simulations to evaluate the benefit of antiviral prophylaxis and patient isolation added to standard (baseline) infection control practice (i.e., vaccination of residents and staff, plus antiviral treatment of residents with symptomatic infection). We calibrated the model to attack rates of 20%, 40%, and 60% for the baseline scenario. For data-driven movements, we found that the largest reduction in attack rates (12.5% to 27%; ANOVA P < 0.001) was achieved when the baseline strategy was combined with antiviral prophylaxis for all residents for the duration of the outbreak. Isolation of residents with symptomatic infection resulted in little or no effect on the attack rates (2.3% to 4.2%; ANOVA P > 0.2) among residents. In contrast, parameterizing the model with random movements yielded different results, suggesting that the highest benefit was achieved through patient isolation (69.6% to 79.6%; ANOVA P < 0.001) while the additional benefit of prophylaxis was negligible in reducing the cumulative number of infections. Our study revealed a highly structured contact and movement patterns within the LTCF. Accounting for this structure-instead of assuming randomness-in decision analytic methods can result in substantially different predictions.},

  abstract     = {Coronaviruses (CoV) comprise a large group of emerging human and animal pathogens, including the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) strains. The molecular mechanisms regulating emerging coronavirus pathogenesis are complex and include virus-host interactions associated with entry, replication, egress and innate immune control. Epigenetics research investigates the genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate phenotypic variation, usually caused by external and environmental factors that alter host expression patterns and performance without any change in the underlying genotype. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, function as important regulators that remodel host chromatin, altering host expression patterns and networks in a highly flexible manner. For most of the past two and a half decades, research has focused on the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses antagonize the signaling and sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs upon infection. More recently, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses, even lytic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, have developed intricate, highly evolved, and well-coordinated processes that are designed to regulate the host epigenome, and control host innate immune antiviral defense processes, thereby promoting robust virus replication and pathogenesis. In this article, we discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate the mechanisms by which viruses regulate the host epigenome, especially focusing on highly pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections as a model. By combining measures of epigenome reorganization with RNA and proteomic datasets, we articulate a spatial-temporal data integration approach to identify regulatory genomic clusters and regions that play a crucial role in the host's innate immune response, thereby defining a new viral antagonism mechanism following emerging coronavirus infection.},

We write down the message passing system of equations for this model and prove, for the first time, that it has a unique feasible solution. We also generalise an earlier result by proving that this solution provides a rigorous upper bound for the expected epidemic size (cumulative number of infection events) at any fixed time [Formula: see text]. We specialise these results to a homogeneous special case where the graph (network) is symmetric. The message passing system here reduces to just four equations. We prove that cycles in the network inhibit the spread of infection, and derive important epidemiological results concerning the final epidemic size and threshold behaviour for a major outbreak. For Poisson contact processes, this message passing system is equivalent to a non-Markovian pair approximation model, which we show has well-known pairwise models as special cases. We show further that a sequence of message passing systems, starting with the homogeneous one just described, converges to the deterministic Kermack-McKendrick equations for this stochastic model. For Poisson contact and recovery, we show that this convergence is monotone, from which it follows that the message passing system (and hence also the pairwise model) here provides a better approximation to the expected epidemic size at time [Formula: see text] than the Kermack-McKendrick model.},

In this work we study how cooperatively growing populations spread on networks representing the skeleton of complex landscapes. By separating the slow and fast variables of the expansion process, we are able to give analytical predictions for the critical conditions that divide the dynamic behaviors into different phases (extinction, localized survival, and global expansion). We observe a resonance phenomenon in how the critical condition depends on the expansion rate, indicating the existence of an optimal strategy for global expansion. We derive the conditions for such optimal migration in locally treelike graphs and numerically study other structured networks. Our results highlight the importance of both the underlying interaction pattern and migration rate of the expanding populations for range expansion. We also discuss potential applications of the results to biological control and conservation.},

For this, we devise a multi-regions discrete-time model with the three classical SIR compartments, describing the spatial-temporal behaviors of homogenous susceptible, infected and removed populations. We suppose a large geographical domain, presented by a grid of colored cells, to exhibit at each instant   the spatial propagation of an epidemic which affects its different parts or sub-domains that we call here cells or regions. In order to minimize the number of infected individuals in some regions, we suggest an optimal control approach based on a travel-blocking vicinity strategy which aims to control a group of cells, or a patch, by restricting movements of infected people coming from its neighboring cells. We apply a discrete version of Pontryagin's maximum principle to state the necessary conditions and characterization of the travel-blocking optimal controls. We provide cellular simulations based on discrete progressive-regressive iterative schemes associated with the obtained multi-points boundary value problems. For illustrating the modeling and optimal control approaches, we consider an example of 100 regions.},

We use an agent-based model to study the spread of influenza in Delhi through person-to-person contact. Two different networks are used: one in which slum and non-slum regions are treated the same, and the other in which 298 slum zones are identified. In the second network, slum-specific demographics and activities are assigned to the individuals whose homes reside inside these zones. The main effects of integrating slums are that the network has more home-related contacts due to larger family sizes and more outside contacts due to more daily activities outside home. Various vaccination and social distancing interventions are applied to control the spread of influenza. Simulation-based results show that when slum attributes are ignored, the effectiveness of vaccination can be overestimated by 30%-55%, in terms of reducing the peak number of infections and the size of the epidemic, and in delaying the time to peak infection. The slum population sustains greater infection rates under all intervention scenarios in the network that treats slums differently. Vaccination strategy performs better than social distancing strategies in slums. Unique characteristics of slums play a significant role in the spread of infectious diseases. Modelling slums and estimating their impact on epidemics will help policy makers and regulators more accurately prioritise allocation of scarce medical resources and implement public health policies.},

Search engines and social networking sites can be used to track trends of different diseases seven to ten days faster than government agencies such as Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC uses the Illness-Like Influenza Surveillance Network (ILINet), which is a program used to monitor Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) sent by thousands of health care providers in order to detect influenza outbreaks. It is a reliable tool, however, it is slow and expensive. For that reason, many studies aim to develop methods that do real time analysis to track ILI using social networking sites. Social media data such as Twitter can be used to predict the spread of flu in the population and can help in getting early warnings. Today, social networking sites (SNS) are used widely by many people to share thoughts and even health status. Therefore, SNS provides an efficient resource for disease surveillance and a good way to communicate to prevent disease outbreaks. The goal of this study is to review existing alternative solutions that track flu outbreak in real time using social networking sites and web blogs. Many studies have shown that social networking sites can be used to conduct real time analysis for better predictions.},

Here, we incorporate the aforementioned heterogeneities into a model by considering a dual-layer static-dynamic multiplex network. The static network layer affords tunable clustering and describes an individual's permanent community structure. The dynamic network layer describes the transient connections an individual makes with members of the wider population by imposing constant edge rewiring. We follow the edge-based compartmental modelling approach to derive equations describing the evolution of a susceptible-infected-recovered epidemic spreading through this multiplex network of individuals. We derive the basic reproduction number, measuring the expected number of new infectious cases caused by a single infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population. We validate model equations by showing convergence to pre-existing edge-based compartmental model equations in limiting cases and by comparison with stochastically simulated epidemics. We explore the effects of altering model parameters and multiplex network attributes on resultant epidemic dynamics. We validate the basic reproduction number by plotting its value against associated final epidemic sizes measured from simulation and predicted by model equations for a number of set-ups. Further, we explore the effect of varying individual model parameters on the basic reproduction number. We conclude with a discussion of the significance and interpretation of the model and its relation to existing research literature. We highlight intrinsic limitations and potential extensions of the present model and outline future research considerations, both experimental and theoretical.},

This framework is applied to a general SEIRS model and the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is derived. The effects of heterogeneity in groups, patches and mobility patterns on [Formula: see text] and disease prevalence are explored. Our results show that for a fixed number of groups, the basic reproduction number increases with respect to the number of patches and the host mobility patterns. Moreover, when the mobility matrix of susceptible individuals is of rank one, the basic reproduction number is explicitly determined and was found to be independent of the latter if the matrix is also stochastic. The cases where mobility matrices are of rank one capture important modeling scenarios. Additionally, we study the global analysis of equilibria for some special cases. Numerical simulations are carried out to showcase the ramifications of mobility pattern matrices on disease prevalence and basic reproduction number.},

We obtained data on the international flight itineraries of travellers who departed yellow fever-endemic areas of the world in 2016 for cities either where yellow fever was endemic or which were suitable for viral transmission. Using a global ecological model of dengue virus transmission, we predicted the suitability of cities in non-endemic areas for yellow fever transmission. We obtained information on national entry requirements for yellow fever vaccination at travellers' destination cities. In 2016, 45.2 million international air travellers departed from yellow fever-endemic areas of the world. Of 11.7 million travellers with destinations in 472 cities where yellow fever was not endemic but which were suitable for virus transmission, 7.7 million (65.7%) were not required to provide proof of vaccination upon arrival. Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Peru and the United States of America had the highest volumes of travellers arriving from yellow fever-endemic areas and the largest populations living in cities suitable for yellow fever transmission. Each year millions of travellers depart from yellow fever-endemic areas of the world for cities in non-endemic areas that appear suitable for viral transmission without having to provide proof of vaccination. Rapid global changes in human mobility and urbanization make it vital for countries to re-examine their vaccination policies and practices to prevent urban yellow fever epidemics.},

  abstract        = {Understanding the dynamics of disease spread is key to developing effective interventions to control or prevent an epidemic. The structure of the network of contacts over which the disease spreads has been shown to have a strong influence on the outcome of the epidemic, but an open question remains as to whether it is possible to estimate contact network features from data collected in an epidemic. The approach taken in this paper is to examine the distributions of epidemic outcomes arising from epidemics on networks with particular structural features to assess whether that structure could be measured from epidemic data and what other constraints might be needed to make the problem identifiable. To this end, we vary the network size, mean degree, and transmissibility of the pathogen, as well as the network feature of interest: clustering, degree assortativity, or attribute-based preferential mixing. We record several standard measures of the size and spread of the epidemic, as well as measures that describe the shape of the transmission tree in order to ascertain whether there are detectable signals in the final data from the outbreak. The results suggest that there is potential to estimate contact network features from transmission trees or pure epidemic data, particularly for diseases with high transmissibility or for which the relevant contact network is of low mean degree.

Here we investigate the impact of human movement on the spatial spread of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Southern Thailand during a recent re-emergence. We hypothesised that human movement, population density, the presence of habitat conducive to vectors, rainfall and temperature affect the transmission of CHIKV and the spatiotemporal pattern of cases seen during the emergence. We fit metapopulation transmission models to CHIKV incidence data. The dates at which incidence in each of 151 districts in Southern Thailand exceeded specified thresholds were the target of model fits. We confronted multiple alternative models to determine which factors were most influential in the spatial spread. We considered multiple measures of spatial distance between districts and adjacency networks and also looked for evidence of long-distance translocation (LDT) events. The best fit model included driving-distance between districts, human movement, rubber plantation area and three LDT events. This work has important implications for predicting the spatial spread and targeting resources for control in future CHIKV emergences. Our modelling framework could also be adapted to other disease systems where population mobility may drive the spatial advance of outbreaks.},

  abstract     = {Contact networks of individuals in healthcare facilities are poorly understood, largely due to the lack of spatio-temporal movement data. A better understanding of such networks of interactions can help improve disease control strategies for nosocomial outbreaks. We sought to determine the spatio-temporal patterns of interactions between individuals using movement data collected in the largest veterans long-term care facility in Canada. We processed close-range contact data generated by the exchange of ultra-low-power radio signals, in a prescribed proximity, between wireless sensors worn by the participants over a two-week period. Statistical analyses of contact and movement data were conducted. We found a clear dichotomy in the contact network and movement patterns between residents and healthcare workers (HCWs) in this facility. Overall, residents tend to have significantly more distinct contacts with the mean of 17.3 (s.d. 3.6) contacts, versus 3.5 (s.d. 2.3) for HCWs ( -value < 10 ), for a longer duration of time (with mean contact duration of 8 minutes for resident-resident pair versus 4.6 minutes for HCW-resident pair) while being less mobile than HCWs. Analysis of movement data and clustering coefficient of the hourly aggregated network indicates that the contact network is loosely connected (mean clustering coefficient: 0.25, interquartile range 0-0.40), while being highly structured. Our findings bring quantitative insights regarding the contact network and movements in a long-term care facility, which are highly relevant to infer direct human-to-human and indirect (i.e., via the environment) disease transmission processes. This data-driven quantification is essential for validating disease dynamic models, as well as decision analytic methods to inform control strategies for nosocomial infections.},

In many of these outbreaks, main transmission routes were healthcare facility-associated and through person-to-person contact. While a majority of existing work on modelling of the spread of infectious diseases focuses on transmission processes at a community level, we propose a new methodology to model the outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), which must be considered at an individual level. Our work also contributes to a novel aspect of integrating real-time positioning technologies into the tracking and modelling framework for effective HAI outbreak control and prompt responses. Our proposed solution methodology is developed based on three key components - time-varying contact network construction, individual-level transmission tracking and HAI parameter estimation - and aims to identify the hidden health state of each patient and worker within the healthcare facility. We conduct experiments with a four-month human tracking data set collected in a hospital, which bore a big nosocomial outbreak of the 2003 SARS in Hong Kong. The evaluation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing epidemic models for characterizing macro-level phenomena such as the number of infected people and epidemic threshold.},

At country level many studies characterized the robust properties of annual epidemics, depicting a typical season. Here we analyzed season-by-season variability, introducing a clustering approach to assess the deviations from typical spreading patterns. The classification is performed on the similarity of temporal configurations of onset and peak times of regional epidemics, based on influenza-like-illness time-series in France from 1984 to 2014. We observed a larger variability in the onset compared to the peak. Two relevant classes of clusters emerge: groups of seasons sharing similar recurrent spreading patterns (clustered seasons) and single seasons displaying unique patterns (monoids). Recurrent patterns exhibit a more pronounced spatial signature than unique patterns. We assessed how seasons shift between these classes from onset to peak depending on epidemiological, environmental, and socio-demographic variables. We found that the spatial dynamics of influenza and its association with commuting, previously observed as a general property of French influenza epidemics, apply only to seasons exhibiting recurrent patterns. The proposed methodology is successful in providing new insights on influenza spread and can be applied to incidence time-series of different countries and different diseases.},

Interpersonal contact patterns play a large role in infectious disease spread, but little is known about the relationship between health care workers' (HCW) movements and contact patterns within a heath care facility and HAI. Quantitatively capturing these patterns will aid in understanding the dynamics of HAI and may lead to more targeted and effective control strategies in the hospital setting. Staff at 3 urban university-based tertiary care hospitals in Canada completed a detailed questionnaire on demographics, interpersonal contacts, in-hospital movement, and infection prevention and control practices. Staff were divided into categories of administrative/support, nurses, physicians, and "Other HCWs" - a fourth distinct category, which excludes physicians and nurses. Using quantitative network modeling tools, we constructed the resulting HCW "co-location network" to illustrate contacts among different occupations and with locations in hospital settings. Among 3048 respondents (response rate 38%) an average of 3.79, 3.69 and 3.88 floors were visited by each HCW each week in the 3 hospitals, with a standard deviation of 2.63, 1.74 and 2.08, respectively. Physicians reported the highest rate of direct patient contacts (> 20 patients/day) but the lowest rate of contacts with other HCWs; nurses had the most extended (> 20 min) periods of direct patient contact. "Other HCWs" had the most direct daily contact with all other HCWs. Physicians also reported significantly more locations visited per week than nurses, other HCW, or administrators; nurses visited the fewest. Public spaces such as the cafeteria had the most staff visits per week, but the least mean hours spent per visit. Inpatient settings had significantly more HCW interactions per week than outpatient settings. HCW contact patterns and spatial movement demonstrate significant heterogeneity by occupation. Control strategies that address this diversity among health care workers may be more effective than "one-strategy-fits-all" HAI prevention and control programs.},

  abstract        = {Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications because it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here, we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3DG64S, has a significant replication defect and that wild-type (WT) and 3DG64S populations have similar adaptability in 2 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3DG64S under selection for replicative speed led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3DG64S exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the lethal level, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3DG64S growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast with what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within-host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity.},

  abstract        = {The factors that determine the pattern and rate of spread of influenza virus at a continental-scale are uncertain. Although recent work suggests that influenza epidemics in the United States exhibit a strong geographical correlation, the spatiotemporal dynamics of influenza in Australia, a country and continent of approximately similar size and climate complexity but with a far smaller population, are not known. Using a unique combination of large-scale laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance comprising >450,000 entries and genomic sequence data we determined the local-level spatial diffusion of this important human pathogen nationwide in Australia. We used laboratory-confirmed influenza data to characterize the spread of influenza virus across Australia during 2007-2016. The onset of established epidemics varied across seasons, with highly synchronized epidemics coinciding with the emergence of antigenically distinct viruses, particularly during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. The onset of epidemics was largely synchronized between the most populous cities, even those separated by distances of >3000 km and those that experience vastly diverse climates. In addition, by analyzing global phylogeographic patterns we show that the synchronized dissemination of influenza across Australian cities involved multiple introductions from the global influenza population, coupled with strong domestic connectivity, rather than through the distinct radial patterns of geographic dispersal that are driven by work-flow transmission as observed in the United States. In addition, by comparing the spatial structure of influenza A and B, we found that these viruses tended to occupy different geographic regions, and peak in different seasons, perhaps indicative of moderate cross-protective immunity or viral interference effects. The highly synchronized outbreaks of influenza virus at a continental-scale revealed here highlight the importance of coordinated public health responses in the event of the emergence of a novel, human-to-human transmissible, virus.},

A couple of avian influenza viruses of H5N1 and H7N9 also posed threats to the general public in Taiwan in the two recent decades. Nevertheless, two seasonal influenza A viruses and two lineages of influenza B viruses continue causing annual endemics one after the other, or appearing simultaneously. Their interplay provided interesting evolutionary trajectories for these viruses, allowing us to computationally model their global migrations together with the data collected elsewhere from different geographical locations. An island-wide laboratory-based surveillance network was also established since 2000 for systematically collecting and managing the disease and molecular epidemiology. Experiences learned from this network helped in encountering and managing newly emerging infectious diseases, including the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 outbreaks.},

This case study focuses on the epidemic outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and H1N1 swine flu in 2009 in Hong Kong, and the subsequent guidelines published by the health authority in relation to the hotel industry in Hong Kong which provide the backbone for discussion. The Metropole Hotel hastened the international spread of the 2003 SARS outbreak by the index case infecting visitors from Singapore, Vietnam, Canada as well as local people via close contact with the index case and the environmental contamination. The one-week quarantine of more than 300 guests and staff at the Metropark Hotel during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu exposed gaps in the partnership with the hotel industry. The subsequent guidelines for the hotel industry from the Centre of Health Protection focused largely on the maintenance of hygiene within the hotel premises. Positive collaborations may bring about effective preparedness across the health and the tourism sectors for future epidemics. Regular hygiene surveillance at hotel facilities, and developing coordination mechanism for impending epidemics on the use of screening, swift reporting and isolation of infected persons may help mitigate the impact of future events. Preparedness and contingency plans for infectious disease control for the hotel industry requires continuous engagement and dialogue.},

  abstract        = {We consider a Markovian SIR-type (Susceptible → Infected → Recovered) stochastic epidemic process with multiple modes of transmission on a contact network. The network is given by a random graph following a multilayer configuration model where edges in different layers correspond to potentially infectious contacts of different types. We assume that the graph structure evolves in response to the epidemic via activation or deactivation of edges of infectious nodes. We derive a large graph limit theorem that gives a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the evolution of quantities of interest, such as the proportions of infected and susceptible vertices, as the number of nodes tends to infinity. Analysis of the limiting system elucidates how the coupling of edge activation and deactivation to infection status affects disease dynamics, as illustrated by a two-layer network example with edge types corresponding to community and healthcare contacts. Our theorem extends some earlier results describing the deterministic limit of stochastic SIR processes on static, single-layer configuration model graphs. We also describe precisely the conditions for equivalence between our limiting ODEs and the systems obtained via pair approximation, which are widely used in the epidemiological and ecological literature to approximate disease dynamics on networks. The flexible modeling framework and asymptotic results have potential application to many disease settings including Ebola dynamics in West Africa, which was the original motivation for this study.},

Due to the large population sizes produced by RNA viruses during replication, this results in a cloud of closely related virus variants during host infection, of which small increases or decreases in replication fidelity have been shown to result in virus attenuation in vivo, but not typically in vitro. Since the discovery of the first RNA virus fidelity mutants during the mid-aughts, the field has exploded with the identification of over 50 virus fidelity mutants distributed amongst 7 RNA virus families. This review summarizes the current RNA virus fidelity mutant literature, with a focus upon the definition of a fidelity mutant as well as methods to confirm any mutational changes associated with the fidelity mutant. Due to the complexity of such a definition, in addition to reports of unstable virus fidelity phenotypes, the future translational utility of these mutants and applications for basic science are examined.},

However, the seasonal and interannual risks of pathogens importation and onward transmission from endemic countries have rarely been quantified and validated. We constructed a modelling framework, integrating air travel, epidemiological, demographical, entomological and meteorological data, to measure the seasonal probability of dengue introduction from endemic countries. This framework has been applied retrospectively to elucidate spatiotemporal patterns and increasing seasonal risk of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China via air travel in multiple populations, Chinese travelers and local residents, over a decade of 2005-15. We found that the volume of airline travelers from South-East Asia into China has quadrupled from 2005 to 2015 with Chinese travelers increased rapidly. Following the growth of air traffic, the probability of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China has increased dramatically from 2005 to 2015. This study also revealed seasonal asymmetries of transmission routes: Sri Lanka and Maldives have emerged as origins; neglected cities at central and coastal China have been increasingly vulnerable to dengue importation and onward transmission. Compared to the monthly occurrence of dengue reported in China, our model performed robustly for importation and onward transmission risk estimates. The approach and evidence could facilitate to understand and mitigate the changing seasonal threat of arbovirus from endemic regions.},

  abstract        = {We study the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other infectious diseases on a dynamic network by using a branching process approach. The nodes in the network represent the sexually active individuals, while connections represent sexual partnerships. This network is dynamic as partnerships are formed and broken over time and individuals enter and leave the sexually active population due to demography. We assume that individuals enter the sexually active network with a random number of partners, chosen according to a suitable distribution and that the maximal number of partners that an individual can have at a time is finite. We discuss two different branching process approximations for the initial stages of an outbreak of the STI. In the first approximation we ignore some dependencies between infected individuals. We compute the offspring mean of this approximating branching process and discuss its relation to the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text]. The second branching process approximation is asymptotically exact, but only defined if individuals can have at most one partner at a time. For this model we compute the probability of a minor outbreak of the epidemic starting with one or few initial cases. We illustrate complications caused by dependencies in the epidemic model by showing that if individuals have at most one partner at a time, the probabilities of extinction of the two approximating branching processes are different. This implies that ignoring dependencies in the epidemic model leads to a wrong prediction of the probability of a large outbreak. Finally, we analyse the first branching process approximation if the number of partners an individual can have at a given time is unbounded. In this model we show that the branching process approximation is asymptomatically exact as the population size goes to infinity.},

Transcription start sites (TSSs) are especially interesting because they are central to initiating gene expression. Previous studies revealed widespread transcription initiation and fast turnover of TSSs in mammalian genomes. Yet, how new TSSs originate and how they evolve over time remain poorly understood. To address these questions, we analyzed ∼200,000 human TSSs by integrating evolutionary (inter- and intra-species) and functional genomic data, particularly focusing on evolutionarily young TSSs that emerged in the primate lineage. TSSs were grouped according to their evolutionary age using sequence alignment information as a proxy. Comparisons of young and old TSSs revealed that (1) new TSSs emerge through a combination of intrinsic factors, like the sequence properties of transposable elements and tandem repeats, and extrinsic factors such as their proximity to existing regulatory modules; (2) new TSSs undergo rapid evolution that reduces the inherent instability of repeat sequences associated with a high propensity of TSS emergence; and (3) once established, the transcriptional competence of surviving TSSs is gradually enhanced, with evolutionary changes subject to temporal (fewer regulatory changes in younger TSSs) and spatial constraints (fewer regulatory changes in more isolated TSSs). These findings advance our understanding of how regulatory innovations arise in the genome throughout evolution and highlight the genomic robustness and evolvability in these processes.},

  abstract        = {The spread of an infectious disease may depend on the structure of the network. To study the influence of the structure parameters of the network on the spread of the epidemic, we need to put these parameters into the epidemic model. The method of moment closure introduces structure parameters into the epidemic model. In this paper, we present a new moment closure epidemic model based on the approximation of third-order motifs in networks. The order of a motif defined in this paper is determined by the number of the edges in the motif, rather than by the number of nodes in the motif as defined in the literature. We provide a general approach to deriving a set of ordinary differential equations that describes, to a high degree of accuracy, the spread of an infectious disease. Using this method, we establish a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. We then calculate the basic reproduction number of the SIR model, and find that it decreases as the clustering coefficient increases. Finally, we perform some simulations using the proposed model to study the influence of the clustering coefficient on the final epidemic size, the maximum number of infected, and the peak time of the disease. The numerical simulations based on the SIR model in this paper fit the stochastic simulations based on the Monte Carlo method well at different levels of clustering. Our results show that the clustering coefficient poses impediments to the spread of disease under an SIR model.},

The basic reproduction number has been computed. The existence and stability of various states have been discussed. The bifurcation diagram has been plotted to show the existence and stability regions of disease-free and endemic states for an isolated patch. The critical level of sterile male mosquitoes has been obtained for the control of disease. The basic reproduction number for n patch network model has been computed.

  abstract        = {Population structure, spatial diffusion, and climatic conditions mediate the spatiotemporal spread of seasonal influenza in temperate regions. However, much of our knowledge of these dynamics stems from a few well-studied countries, such as the United States (US), and the extent to which this applies in different demographic and climatic environments is not fully understood. Using novel data from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, we applied wavelet analysis and non-parametric spatial statistics to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of influenza transmission at regional and international scales. We found the timing and amplitude of epidemics were highly synchronized both within and between countries, despite the geographical isolation of many areas in our study. Within Norway, this synchrony was most strongly modulated by population size, confirming previous findings that hierarchical spread between larger populations underlies seasonal influenza dynamics at regional levels. However, we found no such association when comparing across countries, suggesting that other factors become important at the international scale. Finally, to frame our results within a wider global context, we compared our findings from Norway to those from the US. After correcting for differences in geographic scale, we unexpectedly found higher levels of synchrony in Norway, despite its smaller population size. We hypothesize that this greater synchrony may be driven by more favorable and spatially uniform climatic conditions, although there are other likely factors we were unable to consider (such as reduced variation in school term times and differences in population movements). Overall, our results highlight the importance of comparing influenza spread at different spatial scales and across diverse geographic regions in order to better understand the complex mechanisms underlying disease dynamics.},

  abstract        = {Recent epidemics have entailed global discussions on revamping epidemic control and prevention approaches. A general consensus is that all sources of data should be embraced to improve epidemic preparedness. As a disease transmission is inherently governed by individual-level responses, pathogen dynamics within infected hosts posit high potentials to inform population-level phenomena. We propose a multiscale approach showing that individual dynamics were able to reproduce population-level observations. Using experimental data, we formulated mathematical models of pathogen infection dynamics from which we simulated mechanistically its transmission parameters. The models were then embedded in our implementation of an age-specific contact network that allows to express individual differences relevant to the transmission processes. This approach is illustrated with an example of Ebola virus (EBOV). The results showed that a within-host infection model can reproduce EBOV's transmission parameters obtained from population data. At the same time, population age-structure, contact distribution and patterns can be expressed using network generating algorithm. This framework opens a vast opportunity to investigate individual roles of factors involved in the epidemic processes. Estimating EBOV's reproduction number revealed a heterogeneous pattern among age-groups, prompting cautions on estimates unadjusted for contact pattern. Assessments of mass vaccination strategies showed that vaccination conducted in a time window from five months before to one week after the start of an epidemic appeared to strongly reduce epidemic size. Noticeably, compared to a non-intervention scenario, a low critical vaccination coverage of 33% cannot ensure epidemic extinction but could reduce the number of cases by ten to hundred times as well as lessen the case-fatality rate. Experimental data on the within-host infection have been able to capture upfront key transmission parameters of a pathogen; the applications of this approach will give us more time to prepare for potential epidemics. The population of interest in epidemic assessments could be modelled with an age-specific contact network without exhaustive amount of data. Further assessments and adaptations for different pathogens and scenarios to explore multilevel aspects in infectious diseases epidemics are underway.},

Cases whose origin of infection was likely located outside Araraquara were considered imported. The epidemiological study entailed a descriptive analysis of the data, regarding the distribution of cases by sex, age, and classification of imported and autochthonous cases. A geographic information system was used to map flows and estimate distances. There were 6,913 confirmed cases, 419 of which were imported. In most cases, the origin of infection was located in the state of São Paulo as well as other Brazilian regions. The results indicate the relevance of imported cases and differences in the epidemiological profile with respect to age and sex. Conclusions indicate the need to increase epidemiological and environmental health surveillance at ports, airports, truck stops, and bus and train terminals.},

In France, the availability of a high-quality data set from the Oscour  surveillance network, covering 92% of hospital emergency department (ED) visits, offers new opportunities for disease mapping. Traditional geostatistical mapping methods such as Kriging ignore underlying population sizes, are not suited to non-Gaussian data and do not account for uncertainty in parameter estimates. Our objective was to create reliable weekly interpolated maps of influenza activity in the ED setting, to inform Santé publique France (the French national public health agency) and local healthcare authorities. We used Oscour  data of ED visits covering the 2016-2017 influenza season. We developed a Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach, a class of generalized linear mixed models, with a multivariate normal random field as a spatially autocorrelated random effect. Using R-INLA, we developed an algorithm to create maps of the proportion of influenza-coded cases among all coded visits. We compared our results with maps obtained by Kriging. Over the study period, 45 565 (0.82%) visits were coded as influenza cases. Maps resulting from the model are presented for each week, displaying the posterior mean of the influenza proportion and its associated uncertainty. Our model performed better than Kriging. Our model allows producing smoothed maps where the random noise has been properly removed to reveal the spatial risk surface. The algorithm was incorporated into the national surveillance system to produce maps in real time and could be applied to other diseases.},

We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the generalized model and provide an implicit analytical expression involving the final epidemic size and pairwise reproduction number. As an illustration of the applicability of the general model, we recover known results for the exponentially distributed and fixed recovery time cases. For gamma- and uniformly distributed infectious periods, new pairwise models are derived. Theoretical findings are confirmed by comparing results from the new pairwise model and explicit stochastic network simulation.

  abstract        = {The ongoing economic and political crisis in Venezuela has resulted in a collapse of the healthcare system and the re-emergence of previously controlled or eliminated infectious diseases. There has also been an exodus of Venezuelan international migrants in response to the crisis. We sought to describe the infectious disease risks faced by Venezuelan nationals and assess the international mobility patterns of the migrant population. We synthesized data on recent infectious disease events in Venezuela and among international migrants from Venezuela, as well as on current country of residence among the migrant population. We used passenger-level itinerary data from the International Air Transport Association to evaluate trends in outbound air travel from Venezuela over time. We used two parameter-free mobility models, the radiation and impedance models, to estimate the expected population flows from Venezuelan cities to other major Latin American and Caribbean cities. Outbreaks of measles, diphtheria and malaria have been reported across Venezuela and other diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis, are resurgent. Changes in migration in response to the crisis are apparent, with an increase in Venezuelan nationals living abroad, despite an overall decline in the number of outbound air passengers. The two models predicted different mobility patterns, but both highlighted the importance of Colombian cities as destinations for migrants and also showed that some migrants are expected to travel large distances. Despite the large distances that migrants may travel internationally, outbreaks associated with Venezuelan migrants have occurred primarily in countries proximate to Venezuela. Understanding where international migrants are relocating is critical, given the association between human mobility and the spread of infectious diseases. In data-limited situations, simple models can be useful for providing insights into population mobility and may help identify areas likely to receive a large number of migrants.},

The roles of other types of indirect contact among farms is rarely accounted for. In addition, data on animal movements is seldom available in the United States. However, the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) in U.S. swine represents one of the best documented emergences of a highly infectious pathogen in the U.S. livestock industry, providing an opportunity to parameterize models of pathogen spread via direct and indirect transmission mechanisms in swine. Using observed data on pig movements during the initial phase of the PEDv epidemic, we developed a network-based and spatially explicit epidemiological model that simulates the spread of PEDv via both indirect and direct movement-related contact in order to answer unresolved questions concerning factors facilitating between-farm transmission. By modifying the likelihood of each transmission mechanism and fitting this model to observed epidemiological dynamics, our results suggest that between-farm transmission was primarily driven by direct mechanisms related to animal movement and indirect mechanisms related to local spatial spread based on geographic proximity. However, other forms of indirect transmission among farms, including contact via contaminated vehicles and feed, were responsible for high consequence transmission events resulting in the introduction of the virus into new geographic areas. This research is among the first reports of farm-level animal movements in the U.S. swine industry and, to our knowledge, represents the first epidemiological model of commercial U.S. swine using actual data on farm-level animal movement.},

We apply this framework retrospectively to the 2009 influenza pandemic and 2014 Ebola epidemic to show that key epidemic parameters could be robustly estimated in real-time from public data on local and global spread at very low computational cost. Our framework not only elucidates the dynamics underlying global spread of epidemics but also advances our capability in nowcasting and forecasting epidemics.},

  abstract        = {Networks that grow through the addition of new nodes or edges may acquire degree-degree correlations. When one considers a short epidemic on a slowly growing network, such as the spread of a strain of influenza in a population for one season, it is reasonable to assume that the degree-correlated network is static during the course of an epidemic. In this case using only information about the network degree distribution is not enough to capture the exponential growth phase, the epidemic peak or the final epidemic size. Hence, in this paper we formulate an edge-based SIR epidemic model on degree-correlated networks, which includes the Miller model on configuration networks as a special case. The model is relatively low-dimensional; in particular, considering the fact that it captures degree correlations. Moreover, we derive rate equations to compute two node degree correlations in a growing network. Predictions of our model agree well with the corresponding stochastic SIR process on degree-correlated networks, such as the exponential growth phase, the epidemic peak and the final epidemic size. The basic reproduction number R  and the final epidemic size are theoretically derived, which are equivalent to those based on the percolation theory. However, our model has the advantage that it can trace the dynamic spread of an epidemic on degree-correlated networks. This provides us with more accurate information to predict and control the spread of diseases in growing populations with biased-mixing. Finally, our model is tested on degree-correlated networks with clustering, and it is shown that our model is robust to degree-correlated networks with small clustering.},

We consider an epidemic model that is network based and non-Markovian, containing classic Kermack-McKendrick, pairwise, message passing, and spatial models as special cases. For this model, we prove a monotonic relationship between the variability of the infectious period (with fixed mean) and the probability that the infection will reach any given subset of the population by any given time. For certain families of distributions, this result implies that epidemic severity is decreasing with respect to the variance of the infectious period. The striking importance of this relationship is demonstrated numerically. We then prove, with a fixed basic reproductive ratio (R_{0}), a monotonic relationship between the variability of the posterior transmission probability (which is a function of the infectious period) and the probability that the infection will reach any given subset of the population by any given time. Thus again, even when R_{0} is fixed, variability of the infectious period tends to dampen the epidemic. Numerical results illustrate this but indicate the relationship is weaker. We then show how our results apply to message passing, pairwise, and Kermack-McKendrick epidemic models, even when they are not exactly consistent with the stochastic dynamics. For Poissonian contact processes, and arbitrarily distributed infectious periods, we demonstrate how systems of delay differential equations and ordinary differential equations can provide upper and lower bounds, respectively, for the probability that any given individual has been infected by any given time.},

Our results offer a simulation-based investigation of a population's sensitivity to pandemics across multiple historical time points and highlight three notable trends in pandemic patterns over the years: increased peak prevalence, faster spreading rates, and decreasing spatiotemporal bimodality. We attribute these pandemic trends to increases in two key quantities indicative of urbanization: the population fraction residing in major cities and international air traffic. In addition, we identify features of the pandemic's geographic spread that we attribute to changes in the commuter mobility network. The generic nature of our model and the ubiquity of urbanization trends around the world make it likely for our results to be applicable in other rapidly urbanizing nations.},

  abstract     = {Epidemics of infectious diseases such as SARS, H1N1, and MERS threaten public health, particularly in large cities such as Hong Kong. We constructed a human behavior integrated hierarchical (HiHi) model based on the SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered) model, the Wells-Riley equation, and population movement considering both spatial and temporal dimensions. The model considers more than 7 million people, 3 million indoor environments, and 2566 public transport routes in Hong Kong. Smallpox, which could be spread through airborne routes, is studied as an example. The simulation is based on people's daily commutes and indoor human behaviors, which were summarized by mathematical patterns. We found that 59.6%, 18.1%, and 13.4% of patients become infected in their homes, offices, and schools, respectively. If both work stoppage and school closure measures are taken when the number of infected people is greater than 1000, an infectious disease will be effectively controlled after 2 months. The peak number of infected people will be reduced by 25% compared to taking no action, and the time of peak infections will be delayed by about 40 days if 90% of the infected people go to hospital during the infectious period. When ventilation rates in indoor environments increase to five times their default settings, smallpox will be naturally controlled. Residents of Kowloon and the north part of Hong Kong Island have a high risk of infection from airborne infectious diseases. Our HiHi model reduces the calculation time for infection rates to an acceptable level while preserving accuracy.},

To address the challenge of timely global influenza surveillance, this paper presents a spatial-temporal method that incorporates heterogeneous data collected from the Internet to detect influenza epidemics in real time. Specifically, the influenza morbidity data, the influenza-related Google query data and news data, and the international air transportation data are integrated in a multivariate hidden Markov model, which is designed to describe the intrinsic temporal-geographical correlation of influenza transmission for surveillance purpose. Respective models are built for 106 countries and regions in the world. Despite that the WHO morbidity data are not always available for most countries, the proposed method achieves 90.26 to 97.10 percent accuracy on average for real-time detection of global influenza epidemics during the period from January 2005 to December 2015. Moreover, experiment shows that, the proposed method could even predict an influenza epidemic before it occurs with 89.20 percent accuracy on average. Timely international surveillance results may help the authorities to prevent and control the influenza disease at the early stage of a global influenza pandemic.},

Surveillance was instrumental in identifying the initial case and in minimizing the spread of the virus to other farms. With recent advances in predictive analytics showing promise for health and disease forecasting, the primary objective of this study was to apply machine learning predictive methods (random forest, artificial neural networks, and classification and regression trees) to provincial PEDV incidence data, and in so doing determine their accuracy for predicting future PEDV trends. Trend was defined as the cumulative number of new cases over a four-week interval, and consisted of four levels (zero, low, medium and high). Provincial PEDV incidence and prevalence estimates from an industry database, as well as temperature, humidity, and precipitation data, were combined to create the forecast dataset. With 10-fold cross validation performed on the entire dataset, the overall accuracy was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60 - 0.75), 0.57 (95% CI: 0.49 - 0.64), and 0.55 (0.47 - 0.63) for the random forest, artificial neural network, and classification and regression tree models, respectively. Based on the cross-validation approach to evaluating predictive accuracy, the random forest model provided the best prediction.},

  abstract        = {In 2015, the Zika virus spread from Brazil throughout the Americas, posing an unprecedented challenge to the public health community. During the epidemic, international public health officials lacked reliable predictions of the outbreak's expected geographic scale and prevalence of cases, and were therefore unable to plan and allocate surveillance resources in a timely and effective manner. In this work, we present a dynamic neural network model to predict the geographic spread of outbreaks in real time. The modeling framework is flexible in three main dimensions (i) selection of the chosen risk indicator, i.e., case counts or incidence rate; (ii) risk classification scheme, which defines the high-risk group based on a relative or absolute threshold; and (iii) prediction forecast window (1 up to 12 weeks). The proposed model can be applied dynamically throughout the course of an outbreak to identify the regions expected to be at greatest risk in the future. The model is applied to the recent Zika epidemic in the Americas at a weekly temporal resolution and country spatial resolution, using epidemiological data, passenger air travel volumes, and vector habitat suitability, socioeconomic, and population data for all affected countries and territories in the Americas. The model performance is quantitatively evaluated based on the predictive accuracy of the model. We show that the model can accurately predict the geographic expansion of Zika in the Americas with the overall average accuracy remaining above 85% even for prediction windows of up to 12 weeks. Sensitivity analysis illustrated the model performance to be robust across a range of features. Critically, the model performed consistently well at various stages throughout the course of the outbreak, indicating its potential value at any time during an epidemic. The predictive capability was superior for shorter forecast windows and geographically isolated locations that are predominantly connected via air travel. The highly flexible nature of the proposed modeling framework enables policy makers to develop and plan vector control programs and case surveillance strategies which can be tailored to a range of objectives and resource constraints.},

An effective degree formulation of the model is used in conjunction with the theory of density dependent population processes to obtain a law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem for the epidemic as the population size [Formula: see text], assuming that the degrees of individuals are bounded. A central limit theorem is conjectured for the final size of the epidemic. The results are obtained for both the Molloy-Reed (in which the degrees of individuals are deterministic) and Newman-Strogatz-Watts (in which the degrees of individuals are independent and identically distributed) versions of the configuration model. The two versions yield the same limiting deterministic model but the asymptotic variances in the central limit theorems are greater in the Newman-Strogatz-Watts version. The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the process of susceptible individuals in the limiting deterministic model, for the model with dropping of edges, are the same as for a corresponding SIR model without dropping of edges but an increased recovery rate, though, when [Formula: see text], the probability of a major outbreak is greater in the model with dropping of edges. The results are specialised to the model without dropping of edges to yield conjectured central limit theorems for the final size of Markovian SIR epidemics on configuration-model networks, and for the size of the giant components of those networks. The theory is illustrated by numerical studies, which demonstrate that the asymptotic approximations are good, even for moderate N.},

  abstract        = {The epidemic threshold is probably the most studied quantity in the modelling of epidemics on networks. For a large class of networks and dynamics, it is well studied and understood. However, it is less so for clustered networks where theoretical results are mostly limited to idealised networks. In this paper we focus on a class of models known as pairwise models where, to our knowledge, no analytical result for the epidemic threshold exists. We show that by exploiting the presence of fast variables and using some standard techniques from perturbation theory we are able to obtain the epidemic threshold analytically. We validate this new threshold by comparing it to the threshold based on the numerical solution of the full system. The agreement is found to be excellent over a wide range of values of the clustering coefficient, transmission rate and average degree of the network. Interestingly, we find that the analytical form of the threshold depends on the choice of closure, highlighting the importance of model selection when dealing with real-world epidemics. Nevertheless, we expect that our method will extend to other systems in which fast variables are present.},

  abstract        = {Simple phenomenological growth models can be useful for estimating transmission parameters and forecasting epidemic trajectories. However, most existing phenomenological growth models only support single-peak outbreak dynamics whereas real epidemics often display more complex transmission trajectories. We develop and apply a novel sub-epidemic modeling framework that supports a diversity of epidemic trajectories including stable incidence patterns with sustained or damped oscillations to better understand and forecast epidemic outbreaks. We describe how to forecast an epidemic based on the premise that the observed coarse-scale incidence can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics at finer scales. We evaluate our modeling framework using three outbreak datasets: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore, plague in Madagascar, and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and four performance metrics. The sub-epidemic wave model outperforms simpler growth models in short-term forecasts based on performance metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions namely the mean interval score (MIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval. For example, we demonstrate how the sub-epidemic wave model successfully captures the 2-peak pattern of the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Moreover, in short-term sequential forecasts, the sub-epidemic model was able to forecast the second surge in case incidence for this outbreak, which was not possible using the simple growth models. Furthermore, our findings support the view that the national incidence curve of the Ebola epidemic in DRC follows a stable incidence pattern with periodic behavior that can be decomposed into overlapping sub-epidemics. Our findings highlight how overlapping sub-epidemics can capture complex epidemic dynamics, including oscillatory behavior in the trajectory of the epidemic wave. This observation has significant implications for interpreting apparent noise in incidence data where the oscillations could be dismissed as a result of overdispersion, rather than an intrinsic part of the epidemic dynamics. Unless the oscillations are appropriately modeled, they could also give a false positive, or negative, impression of the impact from public health interventions. These preliminary results using sub-epidemic models can help guide future efforts to better understand the heterogenous spatial and social factors shaping sub-epidemic patterns for other infectious diseases.},

  abstract        = {The number of pathogenic threats to plant, animal and human health is increasing. Controlling the spread of such threats is costly and often resources are limited. A key challenge facing decision makers is how to allocate resources to control the different threats in order to achieve the least amount of damage from the collective impact. In this paper we consider the allocation of limited resources across n independent target populations to treat pathogens whose spread is modelled using the susceptible-infected-susceptible model. Using mathematical analysis of the systems dynamics, we show that for effective disease control, with a limited budget, treatment should be focused on a subset of populations, rather than attempting to treat all populations less intensively. The choice of populations to treat can be approximated by a knapsack-type problem. We show that the knapsack closely approximates the exact optimum and greatly outperforms a number of simpler strategies. A key advantage of the knapsack approximation is that it provides insight into the way in which the economic and epidemiological dynamics affect the optimal allocation of resources. In particular using the knapsack approximation to apportion control takes into account two important aspects of the dynamics: the indirect interaction between the populations due to the shared pool of limited resources and the dependence on the initial conditions.},

This parameter has multiple implications for viral pathogenesis and viral disease control, some of them unveiled thanks to deep sequencing of viral populations. Darwinian fitness is an old concept whose quantification dates back to the early developments of population genetics. It was later applied to viruses (mainly to RNA viruses) to quantify relative multiplication capacities of individual mutant clones or complex populations. The present article reviews the fitness concept and its relevance for the understanding of the adaptive dynamics of viruses in constant and changing environments. Many studies have addressed the fitness cost of escape mutations (to antibodies, cytotoxic T cells or inhibitors) as an influence on the efficacy of antiviral interventions. Here, we summarize the evidence that the basal fitness level can be a determinant of inhibitor resistance.},

Using global flight data to model importation may improve our understanding and prediction of dengue virus importation and onward transmission. A retrospective analysis was performed of surveillance cases of dengue infections imported to China and volume of air traffic to China for the years 2005 through 2014, inclusive. The data were aggregated by year, destination province, and source country. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and a random effects negative binomial model was created to predict the number of imported cases based on the volume of travelers from dengue-endemic countries. There were 1,822 cases of imported dengue infections over the study period. Most imported cases are from a small number of high-incidence countries with a large volume of travel to China, most notably Myanmar (22% of cases). The number of imported cases of dengue infections increased by 5.9% for every 10% increase in travel volume from dengue-endemic countries. Patterns of air travel have a measurable impact on the importation of dengue to China. Modelling dengue importation risk may be a useful strategy to direct public health surveillance and interventions.},

By using a theorem on line-sum symmetric matrices, we establish an eigenvalue inequality on the product of a class of nonnegative matrices and then apply it to prove that the basic reproduction number of the multipatch model is always greater than or equal to that of the single patch model. Biologically, this means that habitat fragmentation or patchiness promotes disease outbreaks and intensifies disease persistence. The risk of infection is minimized when the distribution of mosquitoes is proportional to that of humans. Numerical examples for the two-patch submodel are given to investigate how the multipatch reproduction number varies with human and/or mosquito movement. The reproduction number can surpass any given value whenever an appropriate travel pattern is chosen. Fast human and/or mosquito movement decreases the infection risk, but may increase the total number of infected humans.},

  abstract        = {Dynamic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed) compartmental models provide a tool for predicting the size and duration of both unfettered and managed outbreaks-the latter in the context of interventions such as case detection, patient isolation, vaccination and treatment. The reliability of this tool depends on the validity of key assumptions that include homogeneity of individuals and spatio-temporal homogeneity. Although the SEIR compartmental framework can easily be extended to include demographic (e.g. age) and additional disease (e.g. healthcare workers) classes, dependence of transmission rates on time, and metapopulation structure, fitting such extended models is hampered by both a proliferation of free parameters and insufficient or inappropriate data. This raises the question of how effective a tool the basic SEIR framework may actually be. We go some way here to answering this question in the context of the 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa by comparing fits of an SEIR time-dependent transmission model to both country- and district-level weekly incidence data. Our novel approach in estimating the effective-size-of-the-populations-at-risk ( N ) and initial number of exposed individuals ( E ) at both district and country levels, as well as the transmission function parameters, including a time-to-halving-the-force-of-infection ( t ) parameter, provides new insights into this Ebola outbreak. It reveals that the estimate R  ≈ 1.7 from country-level data appears to seriously underestimate R  ≈ 3.3 - 4.3 obtained from more spatially homogeneous district-level data. Country-level data also overestimate t  ≈ 22 weeks, compared with 8-10 weeks from district-level data. Additionally, estimates for the duration of individual infectiousness is around two weeks from spatially inhomogeneous country-level data compared with 2.4-4.5 weeks from spatially more homogeneous district-level data, which estimates are rather high compared with most values reported in the literature.

The basic reproduction number of the disease is explicitly determined as a combination of sexual and vector-borne transmission parameters. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the disease is primarily transmitted via the vector-borne mode, rather than via sexual transmission, and that sexual transmission by itself may not initiate or sustain an outbreak. Also, increasing the population movements from one city to the other leads to an increase in the basic reproduction number of the later city but a decrease in the basic reproduction number of the former city. The influence of other significant parameters is also investigated via the analysis of suitable partial rank correlation coefficients. After gauging the effects of mobility, we explore the potential effects of optimal control strategies relying upon several distinct restrictions on population movement.},

This shedding sustains the virus in endemic communities and thus contact with camels is considered a major risk factor for human infection. Reducing virus shedding from camels will have a great positive impact on reducing the human risk of infection. Our main objective is to highlight the potential aspects of reducing virus shedding from camels to the environment, thereby reducing the possibility of human infection. We will focus on the potential roles of camel markets, camel shows, importation, transportation and grazing in the amplification and shedding of the virus, providing some novel concepts for the control approaches for the MERS-CoV.},

  abstract        = {Recent years have seen unprecedented growth in international travel. Travellers are at high risk for acquiring infections while abroad and potentially bringing these infections back to their home country. There are many ways to mitigate this risk by seeking pre-travel advice (PTA), including receiving recommended vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis, however many travellers do not seek or adhere to PTA. We conducted a systematic review to further understand PTA-seeking behaviour with an ultimate aim to implement interventions that improve adherence to PTA and reduce morbidity and mortality in travellers. We conducted a systematic review of published medical literature selecting studies that examined reasons for not seeking PTA and non-adherence to PTA over the last ten years. 4484 articles were screened of which 56 studies met our search criteria after full text review. The major reason for not seeking or non-adherence to PTA was perceived low risk of infection while travelling. Side effects played a significant role for lack of adherence specific to malaria prophylaxis. These data may help clinicians and public health providers to better understand reasons for non-adherence to PTA and target interventions to improve travellers understanding of potential and modifiable risks. Additionally, we discuss specific recommendations to increase public health education that may enable travellers to seek PTA.},

  abstract        = {Simulation studies are often used to predict the expected impact of control measures in infectious disease outbreaks. Typically, two independent sets of simulations are conducted, one with the intervention, and one without, and epidemic sizes (or some related metric) are compared to estimate the effect of the intervention. Since it is possible that controlled epidemics are larger than uncontrolled ones if there is substantial stochastic variation between epidemics, uncertainty intervals from this approach can include a negative effect even for an effective intervention. To more precisely estimate the number of cases an intervention will prevent within a single epidemic, here we develop a 'single-world' approach to matching simulations of controlled epidemics to their exact uncontrolled counterfactual. Our method borrows concepts from percolation approaches, prunes out possible epidemic histories and creates potential epidemic graphs (i.e. a mathematical representation of all consistent epidemics) that can be 'realized' to create perfectly matched controlled and uncontrolled epidemics. We present an implementation of this method for a common class of compartmental models (e.g. SIR models), and its application in a simple SIR model. Results illustrate how, at the cost of some computation time, this method substantially narrows confidence intervals and avoids nonsensical inferences.

  abstract        = {Seasonal influenza in the United States is estimated to cause 9-35 million illnesses annually, with resultant economic burden amounting to $47-$150 billion. Reliable real-time forecasts of influenza can help public health agencies better manage these outbreaks. Here, we investigate the feasibility of three autoregressive methods for near-term forecasts: an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model with time-varying order; an ARIMA model fit to seasonally adjusted incidence rates (ARIMA-STL); and a feed-forward autoregressive artificial neural network with a single hidden layer (AR-NN). We generated retrospective forecasts for influenza incidence one to four weeks in the future at US National and 10 regions in the US during 5 influenza seasons. We compared the relative accuracy of the point and probabilistic forecasts of the three models with respect to each other and in relation to two large external validation sets that each comprise at least 20 other models. Both the probabilistic and point forecasts of AR-NN were found to be more accurate than those of the other two models overall. An additional sub-analysis found that the three models benefitted considerably from the use of search trends based 'nowcast' as a proxy for surveillance data, and these three models with use of nowcasts were found to be the highest ranked models in both validation datasets. When the nowcasts were withheld, the three models remained competitive relative to models in the validation sets. The difference in accuracy among the three models, and relative to models of the validation sets, was found to be largely statistically significant. Our results suggest that autoregressive models even when not equipped to capture transmission dynamics can provide reasonably accurate near-term forecasts for influenza. Existing support in open-source libraries make them suitable non-naïve baselines for model comparison studies and for operational forecasts in resource constrained settings where more sophisticated methods may not be feasible.},

  abstract        = {Understanding the effect of media on disease spread can help improve epidemic forecasting and uncover preventive measures to slow the spread of disease. Most previously introduced models have approximated media effect through disease incidence, making media influence dependent on the size of epidemic. We propose an alternative approach, which relies on real data about disease coverage in the news, allowing us to model low incidence/high interest diseases, such as SARS, Ebola or H1N1. We introduce a network-based model, in which disease is transmitted through local interactions between individuals and the probability of transmission is affected by media coverage. We assume that media attention increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease model. We apply the model to the case of H1N1 transmission in Mexico City in 2009 and show how media influence-measured by the time series of the weekly count of news articles published on the outbreak-helps to explain the observed transmission dynamics. We show that incorporating the media attention based on the observed media coverage of the outbreak better estimates the disease dynamics from what would be predicted by using media function that approximate the media impact using the number of cases and rate of spread. Finally, we apply the model to a typical influenza season in Washington, DC and estimate how the transmission pattern would have changed given different levels of media coverage.},

Here, we propose an epidemic spreading model in which resources are used simultaneously to prevent and treat disease. Based on the model, we study the impacts of different resource allocation strategies on epidemic spreading. First, we analytically obtain the epidemic threshold of disease using the recurrent dynamical message passing method. Then, we simulate the spreading of epidemics on the Erdős-Rényi (ER) network and the scale-free network and investigate the infection density of disease as a function of the disease infection rate. We find hysteresis loops in the phase transition of the infection density on both types of networks. Intriguingly, when different resource allocation schemes are adopted, the phase transition on the ER network is always a first-order phase transition, while the phase transition on the scale-free network transforms from a hybrid phase transition to a first-order phase transition. Particularly, through extensive numerical simulations, we find that there is an optimal resource allocation scheme, which can best suppress epidemic spreading. In addition, we find that the degree heterogeneity of the network promotes the spreading of disease. Finally, by comparing theoretical and numerical results on a real-world network, we find that our method can accurately predict the spreading of disease on the real-world network.},

  abstract        = {Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus are the most common viruses associated with acute lower respiratory infections in young children (<5 years) and older people (≥65 years). A global report of the monthly activity of these viruses is needed to inform public health strategies and programmes for their control. In this systematic analysis, we compiled data from a systematic literature review of studies published between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017; online datasets; and unpublished research data. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported laboratory-confirmed incidence data of human infection of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, or metapneumovirus, or a combination of these, for at least 12 consecutive months (or 52 weeks equivalent); stable testing practice throughout all years reported; virus results among residents in well-defined geographical locations; and aggregated virus results at least on a monthly basis. Data were extracted through a three-stage process, from which we calculated monthly annual average percentage (AAP) as the relative strength of virus activity. We defined duration of epidemics as the minimum number of months to account for 75% of annual positive samples, with each component month defined as an epidemic month. Furthermore, we modelled monthly AAP of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus using site-specific temperature and relative humidity for the prediction of local average epidemic months. We also predicted global epidemic months of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus on a 5° by 5° grid. The systematic review in this study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018091628. We initally identified 37 335 eligible studies. Of 21 065 studies remaining after exclusion of duplicates, 1081 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 185 were identified as eligible. We included 246 sites for influenza virus, 183 sites for respiratory syncytial virus, 83 sites for parainfluenza virus, and 65 sites for metapneumovirus. Influenza virus had clear seasonal epidemics in winter months in most temperate sites but timing of epidemics was more variable and less seasonal with decreasing distance from the equator. Unlike influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus had clear seasonal epidemics in both temperate and tropical regions, starting in late summer months in the tropics of each hemisphere, reaching most temperate sites in winter months. In most temperate sites, influenza virus epidemics occurred later than respiratory syncytial virus (by 0·3 months [95% CI -0·3 to 0·9]) while no clear temporal order was observed in the tropics. Parainfluenza virus epidemics were found mostly in spring and early summer months in each hemisphere. Metapneumovirus epidemics occurred in late winter and spring in most temperate sites but the timing of epidemics was more diverse in the tropics. Influenza virus epidemics had shorter duration (3·8 months [3·6 to 4·0]) in temperate sites and longer duration (5·2 months [4·9 to 5·5]) in the tropics. Duration of epidemics was similar across all sites for respiratory syncytial virus (4·6 months [4·3 to 4·8]), as it was for metapneumovirus (4·8 months [4·4 to 5·1]). By comparison, parainfluenza virus had longer duration of epidemics (6·3 months [6·0 to 6·7]). Our model had good predictability in the average epidemic months of influenza virus in temperate regions and respiratory syncytial virus in both temperate and tropical regions. Through leave-one-out cross validation, the overall prediction error in the onset of epidemics was within 1 month (influenza virus -0·2 months [-0·6 to 0·1]; respiratory syncytial virus 0·1 months [-0·2 to 0·4]). This study is the first to provide global representations of month-by-month activity of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus. Our model is helpful in predicting the local onset month of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics. The seasonality information has important implications for health services planning, the timing of respiratory syncytial virus passive prophylaxis, and the strategy of influenza virus and future respiratory syncytial virus vaccination.

Here, we analysed the spatial patterns of human and bovine brucellosis retrieved from the human and veterinary surveillance data, as well as the spatial correlation between human and bovine brucellosis and associated factors that contribute to its occurrence. The risk of human brucellosis was analysed using a Bayesian spatial model with potential risk factors. Our results show that, for both human and bovine brucellosis, hotspots were clustered in the southeast regions of Korea, whereas coldspots were clustered in the northwest regions of Korea. Our study suggests that the risk of human brucellosis increases in rural regions with the highest risk of bovine brucellosis. Collaborative strategies between human and veterinary health sectors (e.g, public health intervention and region-specific eradication programs for bovine brucellosis) would reduce the burden of brucellosis in South Korea.},

  abstract        = {School-closure policies are considered one of the most promising nonpharmaceutical interventions for mitigating seasonal and pandemic influenza. However, their effectiveness is still debated, primarily due to the lack of empirical evidence about the behavior of the population during the implementation of the policy. Over the course of the 2015 to 2016 influenza season in Russia, we performed a diary-based contact survey to estimate the patterns of social interactions before and during the implementation of reactive school-closure strategies. We develop an innovative hybrid survey-modeling framework to estimate the time-varying network of human social interactions. By integrating this network with an infection transmission model, we reduce the uncertainty surrounding the impact of school-closure policies in mitigating the spread of influenza. When the school-closure policy is in place, we measure a significant reduction in the number of contacts made by students (14.2 vs. 6.5 contacts per day) and workers (11.2 vs. 8.7 contacts per day). This reduction is not offset by the measured increase in the number of contacts between students and nonhousehold relatives. Model simulations suggest that gradual reactive school-closure policies based on monitoring student absenteeism rates are capable of mitigating influenza spread. We estimate that without the implemented reactive strategies the attack rate of the 2015 to 2016 influenza season would have been 33% larger. Our study sheds light on the social mixing patterns of the population during the implementation of reactive school closures and provides key instruments for future cost-effectiveness analyses of school-closure policies.},

  abstract        = {It is well recognised that animal and plant pathogens form complex ecological communities of interacting organisms within their hosts, and there is growing interest in the health implications of such pathogen interactions. Although community ecology approaches have been used to identify pathogen interactions at the within-host scale, methodologies enabling robust identification of interactions from population-scale data such as that available from health authorities are lacking. To address this gap, we developed a statistical framework that jointly identifies interactions between multiple viruses from contemporaneous non-stationary infection time series. Our conceptual approach is derived from a Bayesian multivariate disease mapping framework. Importantly, our approach captures within- and between-year dependencies in infection risk while controlling for confounding factors such as seasonality, demographics and infection frequencies, allowing genuine pathogen interactions to be distinguished from simple correlations. We validated our framework using a broad range of synthetic data. We then applied it to diagnostic data available for five respiratory viruses co-circulating in a major urban population between 2005 and 2013: adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We found positive and negative covariances indicative of epidemiological interactions among specific virus pairs. This statistical framework enables a community ecology perspective to be applied to infectious disease epidemiology with important utility for public health planning and preparedness.},

Expressions for the probability that the infection progresses along a given pathway in a line of triangles (LoT) network are presented. Deriving expressions for the probability that the infection ends at any given node allows us to determine the corresponding final size of the epidemic, and hence produce PMFs of the final epidemic size. We illustrate how we can use the results from small networks derived in a previous study to describe how an infection spreads through a LoT network. The key here is to correctly decompose the larger network into an appropriate assemblage of small networks.},

  abstract        = {Seasonal influenza is a worldwide public health concern. Forecasting its dynamics can improve the management of public health regulations, resources and infrastructure, and eventually reduce mortality and the costs induced by influenza-related absenteism. In Belgium, a network of Sentinel General Practitioners (SGPs) is in place for the early detection of the seasonal influenza epidemic. This surveillance network reports the weekly incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, which makes it possible to detect the epidemic onset, as well as other characteristics of the epidemic season. In this paper, we present an approach for predicting the weekly ILI incidence in real-time by resorting to a dynamically calibrated compartmental model, which furthermore takes into account the dynamics of other influenza seasons. In order to validate the proposed approach, we used data collected by the Belgian SGPs for the influenza seasons 2010-2016. In spite of the great variability among different epidemic seasons, providing weekly predictions makes it possible to capture variations in the ILI incidence. The confidence region becomes more representative of the epidemic behavior as ILI data from more seasons become available. Since the SIR model is then calibrated dynamically every week, the predicted ILI curve gets rapidly tuned to the dynamics of the ongoing season. The results show that the proposed method can be used to characterize the overall behavior of an epidemic.},

  abstract     = {Infectious diseases spread through inherently spatial processes. Road and air traffic data have been used to model these processes at national and global scales. At metropolitan scales, however, mobility patterns are fundamentally different and less directly observable. Estimating the spatial distribution of infection has public health utility, but few studies have investigated this at an urban scale. In this study we address the question of whether the use of urban-scale mobility data can improve the prediction of spatial patterns of influenza infection. We compare the use of different sources of urban-scale mobility data, and investigate the impact of other factors relevant to modelling mobility, including mixing within and between regions, and the influence of hub and spoke commuting patterns. We used journey-to-work (JTW) data from the Australian 2011 Census, and GPS journey data from the Sygic GPS Navigation & Maps mobile app, to characterise population mixing patterns in a spatially-explicit SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) meta-population model. Using the JTW data to train the model leads to an increase in the proportion of infections that arise in central Melbourne, which is indicative of the city's spoke-and-hub road and public transport networks, and of the commuting patterns reflected in these data. Using the GPS data increased the infections in central Melbourne to a lesser extent than the JTW data, and produced a greater heterogeneity in the middle and outer regions. Despite the limitations of both mobility data sets, the model reproduced some of the characteristics observed in the spatial distribution of reported influenza cases. Urban mobility data sets can be used to support models that capture spatial heterogeneity in the transmission of infectious diseases at a metropolitan scale. These data should be adjusted to account for relevant urban features, such as highly-connected hubs where the resident population is likely to experience a much lower force of infection that the transient population. In contrast to national and international scales, the relationship between mobility and infection at an urban level is much less apparent, and requires a richer characterisation of population mobility and contact.},

Grey literature, PubMed. and Scopus were searched using specific terms. Most of the available data identified through the systematic literature review concerned entry screening measures at airports. Little evidence is available about entry and exit screening measure implementation and effectiveness at ports and ground crossings. Exit screening was part of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) temporary recommendations for implementation in certain points of entry, for specific time periods. Exit screening measures for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the three most affected West African countries did not identify any cases and showed zero sensitivity and very low specificity. The percentages of confirmed cases identified out of the total numbers of travelers that passed through entry screening measures in various countries worldwide for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) and EVD in West Africa were zero or extremely low. Entry screening measures for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) did not detect any confirmed SARS cases in Australia, Canada, and Singapore. Despite the ineffectiveness of entry and exit screening measures, authors reported several important concomitant positive effects that their impact is difficult to assess, including discouraging travel of ill persons, raising awareness, and educating the traveling public and maintaining operation of flights from/to the affected areas. Exit screening measures in affected areas are important and should be applied jointly with other measures including information strategies, epidemiological investigation, contact tracing, vaccination, and quarantine to achieve a comprehensive outbreak management response. Based on review results, an algorithm about decision-making for entry/exit screening was developed.},

  abstract        = {Deep learning has taken part in the competition since not long ago to learn and identify phase transitions in physical systems such as many-body quantum systems, whose underlying lattice structures are generally regular as they are in Euclidean space. Real networks have complex structural features that play a significant role in dynamics in them, and thus the structural and dynamical information of complex networks cannot be directly learned by existing neural network models. Here, we propose a novel and effective framework to learn the epidemic threshold in complex networks by combining the structural and dynamical information into the learning procedure. Considering the strong performance of learning in Euclidean space, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used, and, with the help of "confusion scheme," we can identify precisely the outbreak threshold of epidemic dynamics. To represent the high-dimensional network data set in Euclidean space for CNN, we reduce the dimensionality of a network by using graph representation learning algorithms and discretize the embedded space to convert it into an imagelike structure. We then creatively merge the nodal dynamical states with the structural embedding by multichannel images. In this manner, the proposed model can draw the conclusion from both structural and dynamical information. A large number of simulations show a great performance in both synthetic and empirical network data sets. Our end to end machine learning framework is robust and universally applicable to complex networks with arbitrary size and topology.},

  abstract        = {Seasonal influenza results in substantial annual morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. Accurate forecasts of key features of influenza epidemics, such as the timing and severity of the peak incidence in a given season, can inform public health response to outbreaks. As part of ongoing efforts to incorporate data and advanced analytical methods into public health decision-making, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized seasonal influenza forecasting challenges since the 2013/2014 season. In the 2017/2018 season, 22 teams participated. A subset of four teams created a research consortium called the FluSight Network in early 2017. During the 2017/2018 season they worked together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble that combined 21 separate component models into a single model using a machine learning technique called stacking. This approach creates a weighted average of predictive densities where the weight for each component is determined by maximizing overall ensemble accuracy over past seasons. In the 2017/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, this multi-model ensemble performed better on average than all individual component models and placed second overall in the CDC challenge. It also outperformed the baseline multi-model ensemble created by the CDC that took a simple average of all models submitted to the forecasting challenge. This project shows that collaborative efforts between research teams to develop ensemble forecasting approaches can bring measurable improvements in forecast accuracy and important reductions in the variability of performance from year to year. Efforts such as this, that emphasize real-time testing and evaluation of forecasting models and facilitate the close collaboration between public health officials and modeling researchers, are essential to improving our understanding of how best to use forecasts to improve public health response to seasonal and emerging epidemic threats.},

While individual models are well defined and the modeling techniques are well understood by practitioners, there is little deliberate choice made as to the type of model to be used, with modelers using techniques that are well accepted in the field, sometimes with little thought as to whether alternative modeling techniques could or should be used. In this article, we divide modeling techniques for spatial transmission into four main categories: population-level models, where a macro-level estimate of the infected population is required; cellular models, where the transmission takes place between connected domains, but is restricted to a fixed topology of neighboring cells; network models, where host-to-host transmission routes are modeled, either as planar spatial graphs or where shortcuts can take place as in social networks; and, finally, agent-based models that model the local transmission between agents, either as host-to-host geographical contacts, or by modeling the movement of the disease vector, with dynamic movement of hosts and vectors possible, on a Euclidian space or a more complex space deformed by the existence of information about the topology of the landscape. We summarize these techniques by introducing a taxonomy classifying these modeling approaches. Finally, we present a framework for choosing the most appropriate spatial modeling method, highlighting the links between seemingly disparate methodologies, bearing in mind that the choice of technique rests with the subject expert.},

Advances in DNA sequencing technology have enabled rapid metagenomic analyses of viruses, but the prediction of virus phenotype from genome sequences is an active area of research. As such, automatic prediction of host tropism from analysis of genomic information is of considerable utility. Previous research has applied machine learning methods to accomplish this task, although deep learning (particularly deep convolutional neural network, CNN) techniques have not yet been applied. These techniques have the ability to learn how to recognize critical hierarchical structures within the genome in a data-driven manner. We designed deep CNN models to identify host tropism for human and avian influenza A viruses based on protein sequences and performed a detailed analysis of the results. Our findings show that deep CNN techniques work as well as existing approaches (with 99% mean accuracy on the binary prediction task) while performing end-to-end learning of the prediction model (without the need to specify handcrafted features).

  abstract        = {Recent epidemics of mosquito-borne dengue and Zika viruses demonstrate the urgent need for effective measures to control these diseases. The best method currently available to prevent or reduce the size of outbreaks is to reduce the abundance of their mosquito vectors, but there is little consensus on which mechanisms of control are most effective, or when and where they should be implemented. Although the optimal methods are likely context dependent, broadly applicable strategies for mosquito control, such as how to distribute limited resources across a landscape in times of high epidemic risk, can mitigate (re)emerging outbreaks. We used mathematical simulations to examine how the spatial distribution of larval mosquito control affects the size of disease outbreaks, and how mosquito metapopulation dynamics and demography might impact the efficacy of different spatial distributions of control. We found that the birth rate and mechanism of density-dependent regulation of mosquito populations affected the average outbreak size across all control distributions. These factors also determined whether control distributions favoring the interior or the edges of the landscape most effectively reduced human infections. Thus, understanding local mosquito population regulation and dispersion can lead to more effective control strategies.},

By incorporating the socio-behavioral differences in social distancing and vaccination uptake into mathematical models of influenza transmission dynamics, we can improve our estimates of epidemic outcomes. In this study we analyze the impact of demographic disparities in social distancing and vaccination on influenza epidemics in urban and rural regions of the United States. We conducted a survey of a nationally representative sample of US adults to collect data on their self-protective behaviors, including social distancing and vaccination to protect themselves from influenza infection. We incorporated this data in an agent-based model to simulate the transmission dynamics of influenza in the urban region of Miami Dade county in Florida and the rural region of Montgomery county in Virginia. We compare epidemic scenarios wherein the social distancing and vaccination behaviors are uniform versus non-uniform across different demographic subpopulations. We infer that a uniform compliance of social distancing and vaccination uptake among different demographic subpopulations underestimates the severity of the epidemic in comparison to differentiated compliance among different demographic subpopulations. This result holds for both urban and rural regions. By taking into account the behavioral differences in social distancing and vaccination uptake among different demographic subpopulations in analysis of influenza epidemics, we provide improved estimates of epidemic outcomes that can assist in improved public health interventions for prevention and control of influenza.},

  abstract     = {Southern Thailand has been experiencing a large chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak since October 2018. Given the magnitude and duration of the outbreak and its location in a popular tourist destination, we sought to determine international case exportation risk and identify countries at greatest risk of receiving travel-associated imported CHIKV cases. We used a probabilistic model to estimate the expected number of exported cases from Southern Thailand between October 2018 and April 2019. The model incorporated data on CHIKV natural history, infection rates in Southern Thailand, average length of stay for tourists, and international outbound air passenger numbers from the outbreak area. For countries highly connected to Southern Thailand by air travel, we ran 1000 simulations to estimate the expected number of imported cases. We also identified destination countries with conditions suitable for autochthonous CHIKV transmission. Over the outbreak period, we estimated that an average of 125 (95% credible interval (CrI): 102-149) cases would be exported from Southern Thailand to international destinations via air travel. China was projected to receive the most cases (43, 95% CrI: 30-56), followed by Singapore (7, 95% CrI: 2-12) and Malaysia (5, 95% CrI: 1-10). Twenty-three countries were projected to receive at least one imported case, and 64% of these countries had one or more regions that could potentially support autochthonous CHIKV transmission. The overall risk of international exportation of CHIKV cases associated with the outbreak is Southern Thailand is high. Our model projections are consistent with recent reports of CHIKV in travelers returning from the region. Countries should be alert to the possibility of CHIKV infection in returning travelers, particularly in regions where autochthonous transmission is possible.},

  abstract        = {The 2018-2019 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), continues to spread. The recent discovery of cases in Uganda and in Goma, a major city in the eastern DRC, raises concern for potential EVD transmission in distant locales via commercial air travel. We examined air travel patterns from the affected region with itinerary-level data from the International Air Transport Association for the year 2018 between July and October, inclusive. We focused on three scenarios: (i) travel from Beni airport, (ii) travel from Beni, Goma and Bunia airports and (iii) travel from Beni, Goma and Bunia, and Kigali airports. We evaluated country-level Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) scores for traveller destinations. There were 2255 commercial air passengers departing from Beni Airport during the specified time frame, all with domestic destinations, and 55% of which were to Goma. A total of 29 777 passengers travelled from Beni, Bunia and Goma airports during this time frame, with most travel (94.6%) departing from Goma Airport. A total of 72.4% of passengers' final destination from these three airports were within the DRC, primarily to Kinshasa. There were 166 281 outbound passengers from Beni, Bunia, Goma and Kigali airports with the majority (82.1%) of passengers departing from Kigali. The most frequent destinations from these airports were Nairobi, Kinshasa and Entebbe. Eight of the 10 destinations with greatest passenger volumes are to countries with IDVI scores less than 0.4. There is little commercial airline connectivity from the current EVD-affected area; however, larger cities in DRC and throughout East Africa should be aware of the low potential for EVD importation through this route. Most countries at greatest risk for EVD importation have limited capacity to manage these cases.},

  abstract        = {Low vaccine-effectiveness has been recognised as a key factor undermining efforts to improve strategies and uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination. Aiming to prevent disease transmission, vaccination may influence the perceived risk-of-infection and, therefore, alter the individual-level behavioural responses, such as the avoidance of contact with infectious cases. We asked how the avoidance behaviour of vaccinated individuals changes disease dynamics, and specifically the epidemic size, in the context of imperfect vaccination. For this purpose, we developed an agent-based simulation model, and parameterised it with published estimates and relevant databases for population demographics and agent characteristics. Encapsulating an age-stratified structure, we evaluated the per-contact risk-of-infection and estimated the epidemic size. Our results show that vaccination could lead to a larger epidemic size if the level of avoidance behaviour in vaccinated individuals reduces below that of susceptible individuals. Furthermore, the risk-of-infection in vaccinated individuals, which follows the pattern of age-dependent frailty index of the population, increases for older age groups, and may reach, or even exceed, the risk-of-infection in susceptible individuals. Our findings indicate that low engagement in avoidance behaviour can potentially offset the benefits of vaccination even for vaccines with high effectiveness. While highlighting the protective effects of vaccination, seasonal influenza immunisation programmes should enhance strategies to promote avoidance behaviour despite being vaccinated.},

We use the bond percolation theory to characterize the coinfection model under two self-awareness control strategies, including immunization strategy and quarantine strategy, and to study the impacts of the synergy effect and control strategies on cooperative epidemics. We find that strengthening the synergy effect can reduce the epidemic threshold and enhance the outbreak size of coinfected networks. On Erdős-Rényi networks, the synergy effect will induce a crossover phenomenon of phase transition, i.e., make the type of phase transition from being continuous to discontinuous. Self-awareness control strategies play a non-negligible role in suppressing cooperative epidemics. In particular, increasing immunization or the quarantine rate can enhance the epidemic threshold and reduce the outbreak size of cooperative epidemics, and lead to a crossover phenomenon of transition from being discontinuous to continuous. The impact of quarantine strategy on cooperative epidemics is more significant than the immunization strategy, which is verified on scale-free networks.},

Moreover, there is a common but non-negligible phenomenon, collective behaviors, during the outbreak of epidemics, are induced by the emergence of epidemics and in turn influence the process of epidemic spread. In this paper, we explore the interaction between epidemic spread and collective behavior in scale-free networks with community structure, by constructing a mathematical model that embeds community structure, behavioral evolution and epidemic transmission. In view of the differences among individuals' responses in different communities to epidemics, we use nonidentical functions to describe the inherent dynamics of individuals. In practice, with the progress of epidemics, individual behaviors in different communities may tend to cluster synchronization, which is indicated by the analysis of our model. By using comparison principle and Gers˘gorin theorem, we investigate the epidemic threshold of the model. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function, we present the stability analysis of behavioral evolution and epidemic dynamics. Some numerical simulations are performed to illustrate and complement our theoretical results. It is expected that our work can deepen the understanding of interaction between cluster synchronization and epidemic dynamics in scale-free community networks.},

  abstract     = {The 2009 pandemic influenza virus caused the majority of the influenza A virus infections in China in 2009. It arrived in several Chinese cities from imported cases and then spread as people travelled domestically by all means of transportation, among which road traffic was the most commonly used for daily commuting. Spatial variation in socioeconomic status not only accelerates migration across regions but also partly induces the differences in epidemic processes and in responses to epidemics across regions. However, the roles of both road travel and socioeconomic factors have not received the attention they deserve. Here, we constructed a national highway network for and between 333 cities in mainland China and extracted epidemiological variables and socioeconomic factors for each city. We calculated classic centrality measures for each city in the network and proposed two new measures (  and  ). We evaluated the correlation between the centrality measures and epidemiological features and conducted a spatial autoregression to quantify the impacts of road network and socioeconomic factors during the outbreak. The results showed that epidemics had more significant relationships with both our new measures than the classic ones. Higher population density, higher per person income, larger   and  , more hospitals and college students, and lower per person GDP were associated with higher cumulative incidence. Higher population density and number of slaughtered pigs were found to advance epidemic arrival time. Higher population density, more colleges and slaughtered pigs, and lower   were associated with longer epidemic duration. In conclusion, road transport and socioeconomic status had significant impacts and should be considered for the prevention and control of future pandemics.},

  abstract        = {Multilayer networks are widely used to characterize the dynamic behavior of complex systems. The study of epidemic spreading dynamics on multilayer networks has become a hot topic in network science. Although many models have been proposed to explore epidemic spreading across different networks, there is still a lack of models to study the spreading of diseases in the process of evolution on multilayer homogeneous networks. In the present work, we propose an epidemic spreading dynamic model of homogeneous evolving networks that can be used to analyze and simulate the spreading of epidemics on such networks. We determine the global epidemic threshold. We make the interesting discovery that increasing the epidemic threshold of a single network layer is conducive to mitigating the spreading of an epidemic. We find that the initial average degree of a network and the evolutionary parameters determine the changes in the epidemic threshold and the spreading process. An approach for calculating the falling and rising threshold zones is presented. Our work provides a good strategy to control epidemic spreading. Generally, controlling or changing the threshold in a single network layer is easier than trying to directly change the threshold in all network layers. Numerical simulations of small-world and random networks further support and enrich our conclusions.},

  abstract        = {Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is considered a common cause of pneumonia, causing about 15-20% of adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and up to 40% of cases in children. It has often been observed that MP epidemics last approximately 1-2 years and occur every 3-7 years, with the dominant strains alternating between epidemics. However, the underlying mechanism by which these cycles and changes in the dominant strains occur remains unclear. The traditional models for the periodicity of MP epidemics neglected two phenomena: structured contact patterns among people and co-circulating strains of MP. We also believe that the two distinctive aspects of MP epidemics: prevalent serotype shifts among epidemics and incidence cycling of MP, are interconnected. We propose a network transmission model that assumes two strains of MP are transmitted within a network structured population and they can interact as secondary infections with primary infections. Our studies show that multiple strains that co-circulate within a network structured population and interact positively generate the observed patterns of recurrent epidemics of MP. Hence our study provides a possible mechanism for the cycling epidemics of MP, and could provide useful information for future vaccine design and vaccine evaluation/monitoring processes.},

Due to its huge threat to the society, precise real-time forecasting of influenza outbreaks is of great value to our public. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network structure that forecasts a real-time influenza-like illness rate (ILI%) in Guangzhou, China. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks is applied to precisely forecast accurateness due to the long-term attribute and diversity of influenza epidemic data. We devise a multi-channel LSTM neural network that can draw multiple information from different types of inputs. We also add attention mechanism to improve forecasting accuracy. By using this structure, we are able to deal with relationships between multiple inputs more appropriately. Our model fully consider the information in the data set, targetedly solving practical problems of the Guangzhou influenza epidemic forecasting. We assess the performance of our model by comparing it with different neural network structures and other state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results indicate that our model has strong competitiveness and can provide effective real-time influenza epidemic forecasting.},

  abstract        = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is primarily transmitted by bio-aerosol droplets or direct personal contacts. This paper presents a detailed study of environmental evidence of possible airborne transmission in a hospital ward during the largest nosocomial SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Retrospective on-site inspections and measurements of the ventilation design and air distribution system were carried out on July 17, 2003. Limited on-site measurements of bio-aerosol dispersion were also carried out on July 22. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the bio-aerosol dispersion in the hospital ward. We attempted to predict the air distribution during the time of measurement in July 2003 and the time of exposure in March 2003. The predicted bio-aerosol concentration distribution in the ward seemed to agree fairly well with the spatial infection pattern of SARS cases. Possible improvement to air distribution in the hospital ward was also considered.Our study revealed the need for the development of improved ventilation and air-conditioning systems in an isolation ward or a general hospital ward for infectious respiratory diseases. The outbreak in Ward 8A, which was in a general hospital and could house nearly 40 patients, demonstrated the cross-infection risks of respiratory infectious diseases in hospitals if a potential highly infectious patient was not identified and isolated. Our example simulation, which extended the SARS Busters' design for an isolation room to Ward 8A, demonstrated that there was room for improvement to minimize cross-infection in large general hospital wards.},

  abstract        = {Until recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the annual mortality burden of influenza to be 250 000 to 500 000 all-cause deaths globally; however, a 2017 study indicated a substantially higher mortality burden, at 290 000-650 000 influenza-associated deaths from respiratory causes alone, and a 2019 study estimated 99 000-200 000 deaths from lower respiratory tract infections directly caused by influenza. Here we revisit global and regional estimates of influenza mortality burden and explore mortality trends over time and geography. We compiled influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality estimates for 31 countries representing 5 WHO regions during 2002-2011. From these we extrapolated the influenza burden for all 193 countries of the world using a multiple imputation approach. We then used mixed linear regression models to identify factors associated with high seasonal influenza mortality burden, including influenza types and subtypes, health care and socio-demographic development indicators, and baseline mortality levels. We estimated an average of 389 000 (uncertainty range 294 000-518 000) respiratory deaths were associated with influenza globally each year during the study period, corresponding to ~ 2% of all annual respiratory deaths. Of these, 67% were among people 65 years and older. Global burden estimates were robust to the choice of countries included in the extrapolation model. For people <65 years, higher baseline respiratory mortality, lower level of access to health care and seasons dominated by the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype were associated with higher influenza-associated mortality, while lower level of socio-demographic development and A(H3N2) dominance was associated with higher influenza mortality in adults ≥65 years. Our global estimate of influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality is consistent with the 2017 estimate, despite a different modelling strategy, and the lower 2019 estimate which only captured deaths directly caused by influenza. Our finding that baseline respiratory mortality and access to health care are associated with influenza-related mortality in persons <65 years suggests that health care improvements in low and middle-income countries might substantially reduce seasonal influenza mortality. Our estimates add to the body of evidence on the variation in influenza burden over time and geography, and begin to address the relationship between influenza-associated mortality, health and development.},

  abstract        = {Economic recession might worsen health in low-income and middle-income countries with precarious job markets and weak social protection systems. Between 2014-16, a major economic crisis occurred in Brazil. We aimed to assess the association between economic recession and adult mortality in Brazil and to ascertain whether health and social welfare programmes in the country had a protective effect against the negative impact of this recession. In this longitudinal analysis, we obtained data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics, the Ministry of Social Development and Fight Against Hunger, and the Information System for the Public Budget in Health to assess changes in state unemployment level and mortality among adults (aged ≥15 years) in Brazil between 2012 and 2017. Outcomes were municipal all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for all adults and across population subgroups stratified by age, sex, and race. We used fixed-effect panel regression models with quarterly timepoints to assess the association between recession and changes in mortality. Mortality and unemployment rates were detrended using Hodrick-Prescott filters to assess cyclical variation and control for underlying trends. We tested interactions between unemployment and terciles of municipal social protection and health-care expenditure to assess whether the relationship between unemployment and mortality varied. Between 2012 and 2017, 7 069 242 deaths were recorded among adults (aged ≥15 years) in 5565 municipalities in Brazil. During this time period, the mean crude municipal adult mortality rate increased by 8·0% from 143·1 deaths per 100 000 in 2012 to 154·5 deaths per 100 000 in 2017. An increase in unemployment rate of 1 percentage-point was associated with a 0·50 increase per 100 000 population per rter (95% CI 0·09-0·91) in all-cause mortality, mainly due to cancer and cardiovascular disease. Between 2012 and 2017, higher unemployment accounted for 31 415 excess deaths (95% CI 29 698-33 132). All-cause mortality increased among black or mixed race (pardo) Brazilians (a 0·46 increase [95% CI 0·15-0·80]), men (0·67 [0·22-1·13]), and individuals aged 30-59 years (0·43 [0·16-0·69] per 1 percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate. No significant association was identified between unemployment and all-cause mortality for white Brazilian, women, adolescents (aged 15-29 years), or older and retired individuals (aged ≥60 years). In municipalities with high expenditure on health and social protection programmes, no significant increases in recession-related mortality were observed. The Brazilian recession contributed to increases in mortality. However, health and social protection expenditure seemed to mitigate detrimental health effects, especially among vulnerable populations. This evidence provides support for stronger health and social protection systems globally. None.},

  abstract        = {Existing research on the relationship between economic recessions and suicides has almost completely concentrated on the most recent global financial crisis (2008). We provide the most comprehensive explanation to date of how different types of economic/financial crises since 1970 have affected suicides in developed countries. Negative binomial regressions were used to estimate what the suicide rates would have been during and 1 year after each crisis began in 21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries from 1970 to 2011 if the suicide rates had followed the pre-crisis trends. We found that every economic/financial crisis since 1970, except the European Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis in 1992, led to excess suicides in developed countries. Among males, the excess suicide rate (per 100 000 persons) varied from 1.1 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.5) to 9.5 (7.6 to 11.2) and, among females, from 0 to 2.4 (1.9 to 2.9). For both sexes, suicides increased mostly due to stock market crashes and banking crises. In terms of actual numbers, the post-1969 economic/financial crises caused >60 000 excess suicides in the 21 developed countries. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 was the most damaging crisis when assessed based on excess suicides. Evidence indicates that, when considered in terms of effects on suicide mortality, the most recent global financial crisis is not particularly severe compared with previous global economic/financial crises. The distinct types of crises (ie, banking, currency and inflation crises, and stock market crashes) have different effects on suicide.},

  abstract        = {The global economic crisis has been associated with increased unemployment and reduced public-sector expenditure on health care (PEH). We estimated the effects of changes in unemployment and PEH on cancer mortality, and identified how universal health coverage (UHC) affected these relationships. For this longitudinal analysis, we obtained data from the World Bank and WHO (1990-2010). We aggregated mortality data for breast cancer in women, prostate cancer in men, and colorectal cancers in men and women, which are associated with survival rates that exceed 50%, into a treatable cancer class. We likewise aggregated data for lung and pancreatic cancers, which have 5 year survival rates of less than 10%, into an untreatable cancer class. We used multivariable regression analysis, controlling for country-specific demographics and infrastructure, with time-lag analyses and robustness checks to investigate the relationship between unemployment, PEH, and cancer mortality, with and without UHC. We used trend analysis to project mortality rates, on the basis of trends before the sharp unemployment rise that occurred in many countries from 2008 to 2010, and compared them with observed rates. Data were available for 75 countries, representing 2.106 billion people, for the unemployment analysis and for 79 countries, representing 2.156 billion people, for the PEH analysis. Unemployment rises were significantly associated with an increase in all-cancer mortality and all specific cancers except lung cancer in women. By contrast, untreatable cancer mortality was not significantly linked with changes in unemployment. Lag analyses showed significant associations remained 5 years after unemployment increases for the treatable cancer class. Rerunning analyses, while accounting for UHC status, removed the significant associations. All-cancer, treatable cancer, and specific cancer mortalities significantly decreased as PEH increased. Time-series analysis provided an estimate of more than 40,000 excess deaths due to a subset of treatable cancers from 2008 to 2010, on the basis of 2000-07 trends. Most of these deaths were in non-UHC countries. Unemployment increases are associated with rises in cancer mortality; UHC seems to protect against this effect. PEH increases are associated with reduced cancer mortality. Access to health care could underlie these associations. We estimate that the 2008-10 economic crisis was associated with about 260,000 excess cancer-related deaths in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development alone. None.},

There were an estimated 4884 (95% confidence interval 3907 to 5860) excess suicides in 2009 compared with the number expected based on previous trends (2000-07). The increases in suicide mainly occurred in men in the 27 European and 18 American countries; the suicide rates were 4.2% (3.4% to 5.1%) and 6.4% (5.4% to 7.5%) higher, respectively, in 2009 than expected if earlier trends had continued. For women, there was no change in European countries and the increase in the Americas was smaller than in men (2.3%). Rises in European men were highest in those aged 15-24 (11.7%), while in American countries men aged 45-64 showed the largest increase (5.2%). Rises in national suicide rates in men seemed to be associated with the magnitude of increases in unemployment, particularly in countries with low levels of unemployment before the crisis (Spearman's rs=0.48). After the 2008 economic crisis, rates of suicide increased in the European and American countries studied, particularly in men and in countries with higher levels of job loss.},

Structured searches of PubMed, and ISI Web of Knowledge, were conducted. Quantitative and qualitative studies reporting health outcomes on children, published since 2007 and related to the 2008 economic crisis were included. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion. Data were synthesised as a narrative review. Five hundred and six titles and abstracts were reviewed, from which 22 studies were included. The risk of bias for quantitative studies was mixed while qualitative studies showed low risk of bias. An excess of 28,000-50,000 infant deaths in 2009 was estimated in sub-Saharan African countries, and increased infant mortality in Greece was reported. Increased price of foods was related to worsening nutrition habits in disadvantaged families worldwide. An increase in violence against children was reported in the U.S., and inequalities in health-related quality of life appeared in some countries. Most studies suggest that the economic crisis has harmed children's health, and disproportionately affected the most vulnerable groups. There is an urgent need for further studies to monitor the child health effects of the global recession and to inform appropriate public policy responses.},

We used the Cyclically Adjusted Primary Balance (CAPB) in terciles as an independent variable to represent the level of austerity adopted in each country. We conducted a longitudinal analysis of panel data using generalized estimating equation models of SMR. We included interaction terms to assess the influence of time period and level of austerity. SMRs generally declined in the study period, except in the last year of the study. In 2015, compared with countries in the low-austerity group, countries with intermediate austerity had excess mortality of 40.2 per 100 000 per year and those with high austerity had excess mortality of 31.22 per 100 000 per year. The results suggest a negative effect on mortality in those countries that apply a higher level of austerity.},

This letter estimates the human cost of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis in one critical dimension-infant mortality-for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis pools birth-level data, as reported in female adult retrospective birth histories from all Demographic and Health Surveys collected in sub-Saharan Africa. This results in a data set of 639,000 births to 264,000 women in 30 countries. We use regression models with flexible controls for temporal trends to assess an infant's likelihood of death as a function of fluctuations in national income. We then calculate the expected number of excess deaths by combining these estimates with growth shortfalls as a result of the crisis. The results suggest 28,000-50,000 excess infant deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in the crisis-affected year of 2009. Notably, most of these additional deaths were concentrated among girls. Policies that protect the income of poor households and that maintain critical health services during times of economic contraction may reduce the expected increase in mortality. Interventions targeted at female infants and young girls can be particularly beneficial.},

We determined the association between unemployment and prostate cancer mortality in members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We used multivariate regression analysis to assess the association between changes in unemployment and prostate cancer mortality in OECD member states between 1990 and 2009. Country-specific differences in healthcare infrastructure, population structure, and population size were controlled for and lag analyses conducted. Several robustness checks were also performed. Time trend analyses were used to predict the number of excess deaths from prostate cancer following the 2008 global recession. Between 1990 and 2009, a 1% rise in unemployment was associated with an increase in prostate cancer mortality. Lag analysis showed a continued increase in mortality years after unemployment rises. The association between unemployment and prostate cancer mortality remained significant in robustness checks with 46 controls. Eight of the 21 OECD countries for which a time trend analysis was conducted, exhibited an estimated excess of prostate cancer deaths in at least one of 2008, 2009, or 2010, based on 2000-2007 trends. Rises in unemployment are associated with significant increases in prostate cancer mortality. Initiatives that bolster employment may help to minimise prostate cancer mortality during times of economic hardship.},

  abstract        = {There is widespread concern that the present economic crisis, particularly its effect on unemployment, will adversely affect population health. We investigated how economic changes have affected mortality rates over the past three decades and identified how governments might reduce adverse effects. We used multivariate regression, correcting for population ageing, past mortality and employment trends, and country-specific differences in health-care infrastructure, to examine associations between changes in employment and mortality, and how associations were modified by different types of government expenditure for 26 European Union (EU) countries between 1970 and 2007. We noted that every 1% increase in unemployment was associated with a 0.79% rise in suicides at ages younger than 65 years (95% CI 0.16-1.42; 60-550 potential excess deaths [mean 310] EU-wide), although the effect size was non-significant at all ages (0.49%, -0.04 to 1.02), and with a 0.79% rise in homicides (95% CI 0.06-1.52; 3-80 potential excess deaths [mean 40] EU-wide). By contrast, road-traffic deaths decreased by 1.39% (0.64-2.14; 290-980 potential fewer deaths [mean 630] EU-wide). A more than 3% increase in unemployment had a greater effect on suicides at ages younger than 65 years (4.45%, 95% CI 0.65-8.24; 250-3220 potential excess deaths [mean 1740] EU-wide) and deaths from alcohol abuse (28.0%, 12.30-43.70; 1550-5490 potential excess deaths [mean 3500] EU-wide). We noted no consistent evidence across the EU that all-cause mortality rates increased when unemployment rose, although populations varied substantially in how sensitive mortality was to economic crises, depending partly on differences in social protection. Every US$10 per person increased investment in active labour market programmes reduced the effect of unemployment on suicides by 0.038% (95% CI -0.004 to -0.071). Rises in unemployment are associated with significant short-term increases in premature deaths from intentional violence, while reducing traffic fatalities. Active labour market programmes that keep and reintegrate workers in jobs could mitigate some adverse health effects of economic downturns.

  abstract        = {A scientific debate is currently taking place on whether the 2008 economic crisis caused an increase in suicide rates. Our main objective was to assess the impact of unemployment rate on suicide rate in Western European countries between 2000 and 2010. We then tried to estimate the excess number of suicides attributable to the increase of unemployment during the 2008-2010 economic crisis. The yearly suicide rates were modelled using a quasi-Poisson model, controlling for sex, age, country and a linear time trend. For each country, the unemployment-suicide association was assessed, and the excess number of suicides attributable to the increase of unemployment was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed, notably in order to evaluate whether the unemployment-suicide association found was biased by a confounding context effect ('crisis effect'). A significant 0.3% overall increase in suicide rate for a 10% increase in unemployment rate (95% CI 0.1% to 0.5%) was highlighted. This association was significant in three countries: 0.7% (95% CI 0.0% to 1.4%) in the Netherlands, 1.0% (95% CI 0.2% to 1.8%) in the UK and 1.9% (95% CI 0.8% to 2.9%) in France, with a significant excess number of suicides attributable to unemployment variations between 2008 and 2010 (respectively 57, 456 and 564). The association was modified inconsistently when adding a 'crisis effect' into the model. Unemployment and suicide rates are globally statistically associated in the investigated countries. However, this association is weak, and its amplitude and sensitivity to the 'crisis effect' vary across countries. This inconsistency provides arguments against its causal interpretation.},

  abstract        = {As with previous economic downturns, there has been debate about an association between the 2008 economic crisis, rising unemployment, and suicide. Unemployment directly affects individuals' health and, unsurprisingly, studies have proposed an association between unemployment and suicide. However, a statistical model examining the relationship between unemployment and suicide by considering specific time trends among age-sex-country subgroups over wider world regions is still lacking. We aimed to enhance knowledge of the specific effect of unemployment on suicide by analysing global public data classified according to world regions. We retrospectively analysed public data for suicide, population, and economy from the WHO mortality database and the International Monetary Fund's world economic outlook database from 2000 to 2011. We selected 63 countries based on sample size and completeness of the respective data and extracted the information about four age groups and sex. To check stability of findings, we conducted an overall random coefficient model including all study countries and four additional models, each covering a different world region. Despite differences in the four world regions, the overall model, adjusted for the unemployment rate, showed that the annual relative risk of suicide decreased by 1·1% (95% CI 0·8-1·4) per year between 2000 and 2011. The best and most stable final model indicated that a higher suicide rate preceded a rise in unemployment (lagged by 6 months) and that the effect was non-linear with higher effects for lower baseline unemployment rates. In all world regions, the relative risk of suicide associated with unemployment was elevated by about 20-30% during the study period. Overall, 41,148 (95% CI 39,552-42,744) suicides were associated with unemployment in 2007 and 46,131 (44,292-47,970) in 2009, indicating 4983 excess suicides since the economic crisis in 2008. Suicides associated with unemployment totalled a nine-fold higher number of deaths than excess suicides attributed to the most recent economic crisis. Prevention strategies focused on the unemployed and on employment and its conditions are necessary not only in difficult times but also in times of stable economy. University of Zurich.},
