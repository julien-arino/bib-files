  Abstract                 = {Current drug choices to treat extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) are scarce; therefore, information on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of alternative regimens is of utmost importance. The aim of this study was to describe the management, drug adverse effects and outcome of alternative combined treatment in a series of XDR-TB patients.A retrospective study was performed on 17 non-AIDS, pulmonary adult patients with XDR-TB admitted to a referral treatment centre for infectious diseases in Buenos Aires from 2002 through 2008. Drug susceptibility testing was performed under regular proficiency testing and confirmed at the national TB reference laboratory.Linezolid was included in the drug regimens of all patients; moxifloxacin and/or thioridazine were included in the regimens of 14 patients. Clinically tractable drug adverse effects were observed in nine patients, the most frequent being haematological disorders and neurotoxicity. In two patients, thioridazine was discontinued. Negative culture conversion was achieved in 15 patients, 11 completed treatment meeting cure criteria, 4 are still on follow-up with good evolution, 1 defaulted treatment and 1 was lost to follow-up.The combination of linezolid, moxifloxacin and thioridazine is recommended for compassionate use in specialized centres with expertise in the management of XDR-TB.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of sampling methods are available to recruit drug users and collect HIV risk behavior data. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a modified form of chain-referral sampling with a mathematical system for weighting the sample to compensate for its not having been drawn randomly. It is predicated on the recognition that peers are better able than outreach workers and researchers to locate and recruit other members of a "hidden" population. RDS provides a means of evaluating the reliability of the data obtained and also allows inferences about the characteristics of the population from which the sample is drawn. In this paper we present findings from a pilot study conducted to assess the effectiveness of RDS to recruit a large and diversified group of drug users in New York City. Beginning with eight seeds (i.e., initial recruits) we recruited 618 drug users (injecting and non-injecting) in 13 weeks. The data document both cross-gender and cross-race and -ethnic recruitment as well as recruitment across drug-use status. Sample characteristics are similar to the characteristics of the drug users recruited in other studies conducted in New York City. The findings indicate that RDS is an effective sampling method for recruiting diversified drug users to participate in HIV-related behavioral surveys.},

  Abstract                 = {Two decades ago, WHO declared tuberculosis a global emergency, and invested in the highly cost-effective directly observed treatment short-course programme to control the epidemic. At that time, most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were susceptible to first-line tuberculosis drugs, and drug resistance was not a major issue. However, in 2013, tuberculosis remains a major public health concern worldwide, with prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis rising. WHO estimates roughly 630 000 cases of MDR tuberculosis worldwide, with great variation in the frequency of MDR tuberculosis between countries. In the past 8 years, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis has emerged, and has been reported in 84 countries, heralding the possibility of virtually untreatable tuberculosis. Increased population movement, the continuing HIV pandemic, and the rise in MDR tuberculosis pose formidable challenges to the global control of tuberculosis. We provide an overview of the global burden of drug-resistant disease; discuss the social, health service, management, and control issues that fuel and sustain the epidemic; and suggest specific recommendations for important next steps. Visionary political leadership is needed to curb the rise of MDR and XDR tuberculosis worldwide, through sustained funding and the implementation of global and regional action plans.},

  Abstract                 = {A survey was conducted in 1995 to assess the prevalence of TB infection using the PPD skin test infection among 3931 inmates in all 21 jails in Lebanon. Forty-five percent of participants had a positive PPD skin test. The likelihood of testing positive was higher among men versus women, and among those who had been incarcerated for more than 3 years versus less than that. Compared to prisoners whose usual residence was Central Lebanon, those from North Lebanon and those from outside Lebanon (mostly Syria and Egypt) had a higher risk for PPD positivity, those from Bekaa a lower risk, and those from South Lebanon about the same risk. Among those with positive PPD tests, 7\% had abnormal chest X-rays suggestive of active infection. Results suggest that TB infection is an important health problem in correctional facilities in Lebanon and that special control programs should target North Lebanon. The importance of screening the incarcerated population with chest X-rays rather than PPD skin tests is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Resistance to anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs continues to present a major challenge to global public health. Resistance usually develops due to inadequate TB management, including improper use of medications, improper treatment regimens and failure to complete the treatment course. This may be due to an erratic supply or a lack of access to treatment, as well as to patient noncompliance. However, the emergence and transmission of drug-resistant TB, including the recently detected extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB), is driven, in part, by the synergistic relationship between TB and HIV (TB/HIV coinfection). There is evidence that persons infected with HIV are more likely to experience XDR-TB. XDR-TB is virtually untreatable with available TB medications. XDR-TB presents a grave global public health threat, particularly in high HIV prevalence settings. The present commentary discusses the current status of XDR-TB and draws attention to the urgency in addressing this problem, for both the global and Canadian public health networks. XDR-TB and the apparent XDR-TB and HIV association warrants further study.},

Stewart's quantitative analysis was applied as a complementary approach to determine the relative contributions of several non-respiratory components to the arterial acid-base response. Acute decrease in body temperature (TB) lowered PaCO2 (32.5 to 14.5 mmHg) and [HCO3-]a(24.20 mEq/L to 17.56 mEq/L), increased pHa (7.481 to 7.608) and diminished the [OH-]/[H+] ratio, but had no significant effect on [SID] or [Atot], although both total phosphorus [PT] and inorganic phosphate [Pi] increased. The acid-base changes found were intermediate between those predicted by alpha-stat and pH-stat hypotheses. Deviation from the regulative alpha-imidazole strategy was more apparent in the plasma than in the intraerythrocyte compartment. We conclude that blood pH changes observed were mainly caused by increased relative ventilation (lung ventilation per unit of CO2 removed) and by resulting changes in PCO2, with a minor metabolic component but without significant contribution from ionic shifts or changes in plasma protein concentration.},

  Abstract                 = {For the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB), potent new drugs are urgently needed. Linezolid is a promising drug, but its use is limited by adverse effects with prolonged administration of 600 mg twice daily. In order to reduce its adverse effects and maintain efficacy, we investigated whether linezolid in a reduced dosage resulted in drug serum concentrations exceeding a ratio of the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) over 24 hours (AUC(24)) [AUC(24)/MIC] of >100.This open-label, prospective pharmacokinetic study evaluated two doses (300 and 600 mg) of linezolid in MDR-TB patients, who received linezolid as part of their treatment. They received linezolid 300 mg twice daily for 3 days, followed by 600 mg twice daily. Blood samples taken at predefined intervals for measuring serum linezolid concentrations were processed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry procedure. The AUC(24)/MIC ratio was used as a predictive model of efficacy. Adverse effects of linezolid, including peripheral neuropathy, were evaluated by clinical and laboratory assessments.Eight patients were included in this study. The median duration of linezolid treatment was 56 days (interquartile range [IQR 44-82] days), with a median cumulative dose of 51,000 mg (IQR 33,850-60,450 mg). The median linezolid AUC over 12 hours (AUC(12)) values were 57.6 mg x h/L (IQR 38.5-64.2 mg x h/L) with the 300 mg dose and 145.8 mg x h/L (IQR 101.2-160.9 mg x h/L) with the 600 mg dose. The AUC(24)/MIC ratios were 452 (IQR 343-513) with the 300 mg dose and 1151 (IQR 656-1500) with the 600 mg dose. Linezolid was well tolerated.Seemingly effective serum concentrations were reached after 3 days of administration of linezolid 300 mg twice daily, i.e. the AUC(24)/MIC ratio was at least 100 in 7 of 8 patients. Larger numbers of patients should be studied to confirm the efficacy of the linezolid 300 mg twice-daily dosage in MDR-TB or XDR-TB treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {During the last few years, PCR-based methods have been developed to simplify and reduce the time required for genotyping Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) by standard approaches based on IS6110-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP). Of these, MIRU-12-VNTR (Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units- variable number of tandem repeats) (MIRU-12) has been considered a good alternative. Nevertheless, some limitations and discrepancies with RFLP, which are minimized if the technique is complemented with spoligotyping, have been found. Recently, a new version of MIRU-VNTR targeting 15 loci (MIRU-15) has been proposed to improve the MIRU-12 format.We evaluated the new MIRU-15 tool in two different samples. First, we analyzed the same convenience sample that had been used to evaluate MIRU-12 in a previous study, and the new 15-loci version offered higher discriminatory power (Hunter-Gaston discriminatory index [HGDI]: 0.995 vs 0.978; 34.4\% of clustered cases vs 57.5\%) and better correlation (full or high correlation with RFLP for 82\% of the clusters vs 47\%). Second, we evaluated MIRU-15 on a population-based sample and, once again, good correlation with the RFLP clustering data was observed (for 83\% of the RFLP clusters). To understand the meaning of the discrepancies still found between MIRU-15 and RFLP, we analyzed the epidemiological data for the clustered patients. In most cases, splitting of RFLP-clustered patients by MIRU-15 occurred for those without epidemiological links, and RFLP-clustered patients with epidemiological links were also clustered by MIRU-15, suggesting a good epidemiological background for clustering defined by MIRU-15.The data obtained by MIRU-15 suggest that the new design is very efficient at assigning clusters confirmed by epidemiological data. If we add this to the speed with which it provides results, MIRU-15 could be considered a suitable tool for real-time genotyping.},

A retrospective re-view of the clinical and laboratory records of 1,810 suspected cases of TB was carried out between January 2004 and September 2008. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of each Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate were analyzed. During the study period, 312 M. tuberculosis culture confirmed cases were recorded; 230 were males and 82 were females. The majority of TB cases (36\%) were seen among expatriates from South and Southeast Asian countries. Fifty-one active TB cases (16\%) were reported in native people (Emaratis) of the country. The peak age group was between 16 and 45 years. Among first-line antituberculosis drugs, resistance to isoniazid was the most common (21\%), followed by streptomycin (14\%). MDR-TB was found in 15 cases (4.8\%). Although the prevalence of TB in UAE is fairly low, an increasing number of cultures confirmed TB and MDR-TB among native and expatriate patients, necessitating improved vigilance in case detection, effec-tive management and prevention of MDR and XDR-TB emergence in the country.},

  Abstract                 = {Thioridazine (TDZ) in combination with antibiotics to which extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is initially resistant yields a cure. This is due to the fact that TDZ enhances the killing of intracellular M. tuberculosis by non-killing macrophages, inhibits the genetic expression of efflux pumps of M. tuberculosis that extrude antibiotics prior to reaching their intended targets, and inhibits the activity of existing efflux pumps that contribute to the multidrug-resistant phenotype of M. tuberculosis. The combination of these effects of TDZ probably contributes to the successful recent cures of XDR-TB cases when the phenothiazine TDZ is used in combination with antibiotics to which the patient with XDR-TB was initially unresponsive.},

MTBC is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), which remains one of the leading causes of disease and morbidity world-wide. DNA fingerprinting methods such as MIRU are key components of modern TB control and tracking. The BN achieves high accuracy on four large MTBC genotype collections consisting of over 4700 distinct 12-loci MIRU genotypes. The BN captures distinct MIRU signatures associated with each lineage, explaining the excellent performance of the BN. The errors in the BN support the need for additional biomarkers such as the expanded 24-loci MIRU used in CDC genotyping labs since May 2009. The conditional independence assumption of each locus given the lineage makes the BN easily extensible to additional MIRU loci and other biomarkers.},

The role of exogenous reinfection as a cause of MDR and XDR TB in these settings has not been determined.We reviewed data from patients with culture-positive TB who later developed MDR or XDR TB in Tugela Ferry, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa during 2005-2006. We performed spoligotyping on initial isolates (obtained at the time of treatment initiation) and follow-up isolates obtained from these patients.We identified 23 patients who developed MDR or XDR TB after being treated for less resistant TB between June 2005 and June 2006. Both initial and follow-up isolates were available for spoligotyping for 17 of these patients. In all cases, the follow-up isolates' spoligotypes differed from those of the initial isolate, indicating exogenous reinfection. Two genotypes (shared type [ST] 34 and ST 60, associated with MDR and XDR TB, respectively) were responsible for 85\% of reinfections. All 17 patients had been hospitalized; all 15 whose HIV infection status was known were HIV-infected.Exogenous reinfection is an important mechanism for the development of MDR and XDR TB. In addition to strengthening TB treatment programs, effective infection control strategies are urgently needed to reduce the transmission of MDR and XDR TB.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is emerging as a major clinical and public health challenge in areas of sub-Saharan Africa where there is a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. TB drug-resistance surveillance in this region has been limited by laboratory capacity and the public health infrastructure; however, with the maturation of the HIV epidemic, the burden of drug-resistant TB is increasing rapidly. The recent discovery of large numbers of cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB in South Africa likely represents an unrecognized and evolving epidemic rather than sporadic, localized outbreaks. The combination of a large population of HIV-infected susceptible hosts with poor TB treatment success rates, a lack of airborne infection control, limited drug-resistance testing, and an overburdened MDR-TB treatment program provides ideal conditions for an MDR-TB and XDR-TB epidemic of unparalleled magnitude. In the present article, we review the history of drug-resistant TB in South Africa, describe its interaction with the HIV epidemic and the resultant consequences, and suggest measures necessary for controlling MDR-TB and XDR-TB in this context. A successful response to the emergence of MDR-TB and XDR-TB will necessitate increased resources for and collaboration between TB and HIV programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) have emerged in high-HIV-prevalence settings, which generally lack laboratory infrastructure for diagnosing TB drug resistance. Even where available, inherent delays with current drug-susceptibility testing (DST) methods result in clinical deterioration and ongoing transmission of MDR and XDR-TB. Identifying clinical predictors of drug resistance may aid in risk stratification for earlier treatment and infection control.We performed a retrospective case-control study of patients with MDR (cases), XDR (cases) and drug-susceptible (controls) TB in a high-HIV-prevalence setting in South Africa to identify clinical and demographic risk factors for drug-resistant TB. Controls were selected in a 1:1:1 ratio and were not matched. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and performed multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors.We enrolled 116, 123 and 139 patients with drug-susceptible, MDR, and XDR-TB. More than 85\% in all three patient groups were HIV-infected. In multivariate analysis, MDR and XDR-TB were each strongly associated with history of TB treatment failure (adjusted OR 51.7 [CI 6.6-403.7] and 51.5 [CI 6.4-414.0], respectively) and hospitalization more than 14 days (aOR 3.8 [CI 1.1-13.3] and 6.1 [CI 1.8-21.0], respectively). Prior default from TB treatment was not a risk factor for MDR or XDR-TB. HIV was a risk factor for XDR (aOR 8.2, CI 1.3-52.6), but not MDR-TB. Comparing XDR with MDR-TB patients, the only significant risk factor for XDR-TB was HIV infection (aOR 5.3, CI 1.0-27.6).In this high-HIV-prevalence and drug-resistant TB setting, a history of prolonged hospitalization and previous TB treatment failure were strong risk factors for both MDR and XDR-TB. Given high mortality observed among patients with HIV and drug-resistant TB co-infection, previously treated and hospitalized patients should be considered for empiric second-line TB therapy while awaiting confirmatory DST results in settings with a high-burden of MDR/XDR-TB.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the way optimization theory has been used in canopy models to analyse the adaptive significance of photosynthesis-related plant characteristics and their consequences for the structure and species composition of vegetation stands.In most studies simple optimization has been used with trait values optimal when they lead to maximum whole-stand photosynthesis. This approach is subject to the condition that the optimum for one individual is independent of the characteristics of its neighbours. This seems unlikely in vegetation stands where neighbour plants strongly influence each other's light climate. Not surprisingly, there are consistent deviations between predicted plant traits and real values: plants tend to be taller, distribute nitrogen more evenly among their leaves and produce more leaf area which is projected more horizontally than predicted by models.By applying game theory to individual plant-based canopy models, other studies have shown that optimal vegetation stands with maximum whole-stand photosynthesis are not evolutionarily stable. They can be successfully invaded by mutants that are taller, project their leaves more horizontally or that produce greater than optimal leaf areas. While these individual-based models can successfully predict the canopy structure of vegetation stands, they are invariably determined at unique optimal trait values. They do not allow for the co-existence of more than one species with different characteristics. Canopy models can contribute to our understanding of species coexistence through (a) simultaneous analysis of the various traits that determine light capture and photosynthesis and the trade-offs between them, and (b) consideration of trade-offs associated with specialization to different positions in the niche space defined by temporal and spatial heterogeneity of resources.},

  Abstract                 = {A condition is derived for reciprocal altruism to evolve by kin or group selection. It is assumed that many additively acting genes of small effect and the environment determine the probability that an individual is a reciprocal altruist, as opposed to being unconditionally selfish. The particular form of reciprocal altruism considered is TIT FOR TAT, a strategy that involves being altruistic on the first encounter with another individual and doing whatever the other did on the previous encounter in subsequent encounters with the same individual. Encounters are restricted to individuals of the same generation belonging to the same kin or breeding group, but first encounters occur at random within that group. The number of individuals with which an individual interacts is assumed to be the same within any kin or breeding group. There are 1 + i expected encounters between two interacting individuals. On any encounter, it is assumed that an individual who behaves altruistically suffers a cost in personal fitness proportional to c while improving his partner's fitness by the same proportion of b. Then, the condition for kin or group selection to prevail is [Formula: see text] if group size is sufficiently large and the group mean and the within-group genotypic variance of the trait value (i.e., the probability of being a TIT-FOR-TAT strategist) are uncorrelated. Here, C, Vb, and Tb are the population mean, between-group variance, and between-group third central moment of the trait value and r is the correlation between the additive genotypic values of interacting kin or of individuals within the same breeding group. The right-hand side of the above inequality is monotone decreasing in C if we hold Tb/Vb constant, and kin and group selection become superfluous beyond a certain threshold value of C. The effect of finite group size is also considered in a kin-selection model.},

  Abstract                 = {The Styblo model is the result of international collaboration aimed at the expansion of national tuberculosis (TB) programs in partner countries. This model is the foundation of the DOTS strategy launched in the 1990s and which was subsequently expanded as a global strategy. This paper discusses the impact and relevance of this body of work. The basic principles supporting the model still hold. There is a tendency to be all-inclusive when global strategies are devised, which increases the complexity of such strategies. Whereas it is relatively easy to standardize diagnosis and surveillance, this is not the case with patient care and treatment where, as recent experiences in TB programs show, universal recommendations can be controversial. It may be unwise to put forward global strategies when the terrain is as variable as it is in different parts of the world. Since the conception of the model, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic has been gaining force in Africa. As a result, TB control efforts on the continent have been severely undermined. The relevance of the model in this setting is questioned. Although HIV infection has contributed to outbreaks of drug-resistant TB, it has also facilitated the control of outbreaks of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. Where MDR-TB has reached critical proportions in the absence of HIV, it has proven difficult to control. Technological development has not kept up with the need for new tools. Whereas many policy analysts agree that a revised strategy is required, a convincing breakthrough has yet to appear.},

This study aimed to analyse data on antituberculosis drug resistance gathered by the WHO and International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Global Project on Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance.Data on drug susceptibility testing for four antituberculosis drugs--isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and streptomycin--were gathered in the third round of the Global Project (1999-2002) from surveys or ongoing surveillance in 79 countries or geographical settings. These data were combined with those from the first two rounds of the project and analyses were done. Countries that participated followed a standardised set of guidelines to ensure comparability both between and within countries.The median prevalence of resistance to any of the four antituberculosis drugs in new cases of tuberculosis identified in 76 countries or geographical settings was 10.2\% (range 0.0-57.1). The median prevalence of multidrug resistance in new cases was 1.0\% (range 0.0-14.2). Kazakhstan, Tomsk Oblast (Russia), Karakalpakstan (Uzbekistan), Estonia, Israel, the Chinese provinces Liaoning and Henan, Lithuania, and Latvia reported prevalence of multidrug resistance above 6.5\%. Trend analysis showed a significant increase in the prevalence of multidrug resistance in new cases in Tomsk Oblast (p<0.0001). Hong Kong (p=0.01) and the USA (p=0.0002) reported significant decreasing trends in multidrug resistance in new cases of tuberculosis.Multidrug resistance represents a serious challenge for tuberculosis control in countries of the former Soviet Union and in some provinces of China. Gaps in coverage of the Global Project are substantial, and baseline information is urgently required from several countries with high tuberculosis burden to develop appropriate control interventions.},

  Abstract                 = {Infectious diseases are the second leading cause of death worldwide. In order to better understand and treat them, an accurate evaluation using multi-modal imaging techniques for anatomical and functional characterizations is needed. For non-invasive imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), there have been many engineering improvements that have significantly enhanced the resolution and contrast of the images, but there are still insufficient computational algorithms available for researchers to use when accurately quantifying imaging data from anatomical structures and functional biological processes. Since the development of such tools may potentially translate basic research into the clinic, this study focuses on the development of a quantitative and qualitative image analysis platform that provides a computational radiology perspective for pulmonary infections in small animal models. Specifically, we designed (a) a fast and robust automated and semi-automated image analysis platform and a quantification tool that can facilitate accurate diagnostic measurements of pulmonary lesions as well as volumetric measurements of anatomical structures, and incorporated (b) an image registration pipeline to our proposed framework for volumetric comparison of serial scans. This is an important investigational tool for small animal infectious disease models that can help advance researchers' understanding of infectious diseases.We tested the utility of our proposed methodology by using sequentially acquired CT and PET images of rabbit, ferret, and mouse models with respiratory infections of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), H1N1 flu virus, and an aerosolized respiratory pathogen (necrotic TB) for a total of 92, 44, and 24 scans for the respective studies with half of the scans from CT and the other half from PET. Institutional Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care approvals were obtained prior to conducting this research. First, the proposed computational framework registered PET and CT images to provide spatial correspondences between images. Second, the lungs from the CT scans were segmented using an interactive region growing (IRG) segmentation algorithm with mathematical morphology operations to avoid false positive (FP) uptake in PET images. Finally, we segmented significant radiotracer uptake from the PET images in lung regions determined from CT and computed metabolic volumes of the significant uptake. All segmentation processes were compared with expert radiologists' delineations (ground truths). Metabolic and gross volume of lesions were automatically computed with the segmentation processes using PET and CT images, and percentage changes in those volumes over time were calculated. (Continued on next page)(Continued from previous page) Standardized uptake value (SUV) analysis from PET images was conducted as a complementary quantitative metric for disease severity assessment. Thus, severity and extent of pulmonary lesions were examined through both PET and CT images using the aforementioned quantification metrics outputted from the proposed framework.Each animal study was evaluated within the same subject class, and all steps of the proposed methodology were evaluated separately. We quantified the accuracy of the proposed algorithm with respect to the state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. For evaluation of the segmentation results, dice similarity coefficient (DSC) as an overlap measure and Haussdorf distance as a shape dissimilarity measure were used. Significant correlations regarding the estimated lesion volumes were obtained both in CT and PET images with respect to the ground truths (R2=0.8922,p<0.01 and R2=0.8664,p<0.01, respectively). The segmentation accuracy (DSC (\%)) was 93.4±4.5\% for normal lung CT scans and 86.0±7.1\% for pathological lung CT scans. Experiments showed excellent agreements (all above 85\%) with expert evaluations for both structural and functional imaging modalities. Apart from quantitative analysis of each animal, we also qualitatively showed how metabolic volumes were changing over time by examining serial PET/CT scans. Evaluation of the registration processes was based on precisely defined anatomical landmark points by expert clinicians. An average of 2.66, 3.93, and 2.52 mm errors was found in rabbit, ferret, and mouse data (all within the resolution limits), respectively. Quantitative results obtained from the proposed methodology were visually related to the progress and severity of the pulmonary infections as verified by the participating radiologists. Moreover, we demonstrated that lesions due to the infections were metabolically active and appeared multi-focal in nature, and we observed similar patterns in the CT images as well. Consolidation and ground glass opacity were the main abnormal imaging patterns and consistently appeared in all CT images. We also found that the gross and metabolic lesion volume percentage follow the same trend as the SUV-based evaluation in the longitudinal analysis.We explored the feasibility of using PET and CT imaging modalities in three distinct small animal models for two diverse pulmonary infections. We concluded from the clinical findings, derived from the proposed computational pipeline, that PET-CT imaging is an invaluable hybrid modality for tracking pulmonary infections longitudinally in small animals and has great potential to become routinely used in clinics. Our proposed methodology showed that automated computed-aided lesion detection and quantification of pulmonary infections in small animal models are efficient and accurate as compared to the clinical standard of manual and semi-automated approaches. Automated analysis of images in pre-clinical applications can increase the efficiency and quality of pre-clinical findings that ultimately inform downstream experimental design in human clinical studies; this innovation will allow researchers and clinicians to more effectively allocate study resources with respect to research demands without compromising accuracy.},

The number of newly detected cases of TB in child groups declined between 1958 and 1978 from 78.2 to 5.5 per 100 000 children. The number of cases of tuberculous meningitis declined during this period in the entire population from 97 to 5 cases. There was a markes shift of newly detected cases into higher age groups. The prevalence of bacillary TB decline from 211.1 in 1956 to 39.0 in 1977 per 100 000 population. According to mathematical and statistical calculations the incidence of TB will preserve also in future its declining trend whereby the values at the turn of the century will be at the borderline of the lower half of the value recorded at present.},

Two other passengers developed confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 infection, 12 and 48 hours after the flight. They reported no other potential sources of infection. Their seating was within two rows of infected passengers, implying a risk of infection of about 3.5\% for the 57 passengers in those rows. All but one of the confirmed pandemic A/H1N1 infected travellers reported cough, but more complex definitions of influenza cases had relatively low sensitivity. Rigorous follow-up by public health workers located 93\% of passengers, but only 52\% were contacted within 72 hours of arrival.A low but measurable risk of transmission of pandemic A/H1N1 exists during modern commercial air travel. This risk is concentrated close to infected passengers with symptoms. Follow-up and screening of exposed passengers is slow and difficult once they have left the airport.},

  Abstract                 = {Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health emergency. We investigated the characteristics and extent of XDR TB in California to inform public health interventions.XDR TB was defined as TB with resistance to at least isoniazid, rifampin, a fluoroquinolone, and 1 of 3 injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). Pre-XDR TB was defined as TB with resistance to isoniazid and rifampin and either a fluoroquinolone or second-line injectable agent but not both. We analyzed TB case reports submitted to the state TB registry for the period 1993-2006. Local health departments and the state TB laboratory were queried to ensure complete drug susceptibility reporting.Among 424 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB cases with complete drug susceptibility reporting, 18 (4.2\%) were extensively drug resistant, and 77 (18\%) were pre-extensively drug resistant. The proportion of pre-XDR TB cases increased over time, from 7\% in 1993 to 32\% in 2005 (P = .02)). Among XDR TB cases, 83\% of cases involved foreign-born patients, and 43\% were diagnosed in patients within 6 months after arrival in the United States. Mexico was the most common country of origin. Five cases (29\%) of XDR TB were acquired during therapy in California. All patients with XDR TB had pulmonary disease, and most had prolonged infectious periods; the median time for conversion of sputum culture results was 195 days. Among 17 patients with known outcomes, 7 (41.2\%) completed therapy, 5 (29.4\%) moved, and 5 (29.4\%) died. One patient continues to receive treatment.XDR TB and pre-XDR TB cases comprise a substantial fraction of MDR TB cases in California, indicating the need for interventions that improve surveillance, directly observed therapy, and rapid drug susceptibility testing and reporting.},

  abstract    = {Over one-third of the world's population has been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). New drug designs are necessitated by the appearance of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). This work presents four hydrazide compounds that inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth at potency comparable to isoniazid. The hydrazide drugs A, B, C, and D were synthesized utilizing microwave excitation methodologies. Hydrazide agents are produced from parent carboxyl compounds. All reactions were accomplished in dry conditions. Using suitable molecular scaffolds the final hydrazides possessed the desired properties in Log P, polar surface area, molecular weight, etc. All four hydrazide compounds induced at least 60\% inhibition of TB at concentrations at less than 31.5 microgram/mL. Measured as relative survival, all four hydrazide compounds induced greater than 95\% death of TB bacteria at concentrations less than 31.5 microgram/mL. Drugs A, B, C, D exhibited zero violations of the Rule of 5, indicating favorable bioavailability. Although isoniazid, A, B, C, and D were determined to have a polar surface area less than 70 Angstroms2, the values of Log P (a measurement of lipophilicity) showed a broad range of -1.463 (drug C) to 4.46 (drug A). The numerical values of polar surface area suggests that all drugs would have greater than 50\% intestinal absorption. For all drugs the number of amine (-NH) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups remains constant at three, with number of oxygens and nitrogens varying only three to four. ANOSIM (analysis of similarity) indicated that isoniazid, A, B, C, and D are highly similar. Correlation of molecular properties for all five drugs is greater than r = 0.9500. Drugs A, B, C, and D are members of two homologous series of anti-tuberculosis agents. All hydrazides effectively inhibited TB at 31.5 micrograms/mL and lower concentrations.},

  Abstract                 = {Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis has spread among hospitalised patients in South Africa, but the epidemic-level effect of hospital-based infection control strategies remains unknown. We modelled the plausible effect of rapidly available infection control strategies on the overall course of the XDR tuberculosis epidemic in a rural area of South Africa.We investigated the effect of administrative, environmental, and personal infection control measures on the epidemic trajectory of XDR tuberculosis in the rural community of Tugela Ferry. Assessments were done with a mathematical model incorporating over 2 years of longitudinal inpatient and community-based data. The model simulated inpatient airborne tuberculosis transmission, community tuberculosis transmission, and the effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy.If no new interventions are introduced, about 1300 cases of XDR tuberculosis are predicted to occur in the area of Tugela Ferry by the end of 2012, more than half of which are likely to be nosocomially transmitted. Mask use alone would avert fewer than 10\% of cases in the overall epidemic, but could prevent a large proportion of cases of XDR tuberculosis in hospital staff. The combination of mask use with reduced hospitalisation time and a shift to outpatient therapy could prevent nearly a third of XDR tuberculosis cases. Supplementing this approach with improved ventilation, rapid drug resistance testing, HIV treatment, and tuberculosis isolation facilities could avert 48\% of XDR tuberculosis cases (range 34-50\%) by the end of 2012. However, involuntary detention could result in an unexpected rise in incidence due to restricted isolation capacity.A synergistic combination of available nosocomial infection control strategies could prevent nearly half of XDR tuberculosis cases, even in a resource-limited setting. XDR tuberculosis transmission will probably continue in the community, indicating the need to develop and implement parallel community-based programmes.},

Isoniazid (INH) resistant TB was observed to increase by <1\% per year, even when using pessimistic assumptions about resistance emergence. The use of tuberculin skin testing had little impact as a screening procedure, while secondary treatment was observed to nearly double the impact of a preventive treatment program. Regardless of whether or not preventive treatment was implemented, INH-resistant TB rose in the context of increasing HIV prevalence, but was minimally amplified by preventive treatment itself.IPT programs implemented through ARV clinics may be effective at reducing TB incidence. The resistance contribution of IPT appears unlikely to supersede its overall incidence and mortality benefits.},

Roy Polio Clinic and Hospital for Crippled Children in 1965-80. Yearly statistics indicate a rising trend in the incidence of polio, with the lowest number of cases (522) encountered in 1966 and the highest number (2208) in 1979. 48\% of patients attened the hospital in the acute stage of the disease and 10\% were seen in the residual stage. The cases came from virtually all the states of India, indicating polio's endemic characteristic. An unexpected finding was that the polio cases were equally distributed between urban (50.03\%) and rural (49.98\%) areas. The duration of illness was 1-30 days in 48\% of cases, 31 days-2 years in 42\% of cases, and over 2 years in another 10\%. Of interest was the observation of a uniform fluctuation (a peak followed by a lull) in alternate years. It is speculated that, in the years with a higher disease incidence, the immunity status of the population improves from subclinical infection. These findings point to a need for continuing emphasis on the prevention and control of poliomyelitis as well as proper surveillance and recording.},

Bacteria from patients, staff and air were monitored and the transmission of isolated microorganisms was followed. Handwashing samples revealed pathogenic bacteria in 30.8\% of physicians (average number of colony forming units: 71,300 per hand) and 16.6\% of nurses (39,800 cfu per hand). Air cultures yielded pathogens in 15\% of sampling periods and nine of 53 patients were found to be colonized with Gram-negative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus or Candida spp. The spectrum of bacteria recovered from patients and air was generally different, whereas strains recovered from patients and their attendants' hands were indistinguishable on multiple occasions. The results of this study confirm that direct contact is the principal pathway of microbial transmission, whereas little evidence for a significant role of airborne transmission is shown. The call for more extensive air-filtering and ventilation systems in medical intensive care units is not supported by the results shown in this communication.},

  Abstract                 = {Formulation and evaluation of public health policy commonly employs science-based mathematical models. For instance, epidemiological dynamics of TB is dominated, in general, by flow between actively and latently infected populations. Thus modelling is central in planning public health intervention. However, models are highly uncertain because they are based on observations that are geographically and temporally distinct from the population to which they are applied.We aim to demonstrate the advantages of info-gap theory, a non-probabilistic approach to severe uncertainty when worst cases cannot be reliably identified and probability distributions are unreliable or unavailable. Info-gap is applied here to mathematical modelling of epidemics and analysis of public health decision-making.Applying info-gap robustness analysis to tuberculosis/HIV (TB/HIV) epidemics, we illustrate the critical role of incorporating uncertainty in formulating recommendations for interventions. Robustness is assessed as the magnitude of uncertainty that can be tolerated by a given intervention. We illustrate the methodology by exploring interventions that alter the rates of diagnosis, cure, relapse and HIV infection.We demonstrate several policy implications. Equivalence among alternative rates of diagnosis and relapse are identified. The impact of initial TB and HIV prevalence on the robustness to uncertainty is quantified. In some configurations, increased aggressiveness of intervention improves the predicted outcome but also reduces the robustness to uncertainty. Similarly, predicted outcomes may be better at larger target times, but may also be more vulnerable to model error.The info-gap framework is useful for managing model uncertainty and is attractive when uncertainties on model parameters are extreme. When a public health model underlies guidelines, info-gap decision theory provides valuable insight into the confidence of achieving agreed-upon goals.},

Mathematical modelling and experience in resource-rich countries suggest HIV drug-resistance transmission will increase as antiretroviral therapy coverage increases, but its rise will be limited initially. Transmission surveys should begin in geographic areas in each country where antiretroviral therapy coverage is widespread. Reports from resource-limited countries suggest that antiretroviral therapy programs are as effective as in resource-rich countries, which should limit HIV drug resistance if effectiveness is maintained with antiretroviral therapy expansion. Surveillance of HIV drug resistance emerging in treatment and other factors will support implementation of prevention measures on a population level.Standardized surveillance of transmitted and treatment-associated HIV drug resistance is critical to the success of antiretroviral therapy expansion in developing countries. Routine assessment of prescribing practices, availability of and access to appropriate regimens for adults and children, antiretroviral drug supply continuity, and measures to prevent HIV transmission will supply critical information for HIV drug-resistance prevention.},

An integral component of pandemic preparedness in many countries was the targeted use of antiviral therapy for containment, disease mitigation, and treatment. The 2009 pandemic marked the first pandemic during which influenza antivirals were available for global use. Although most national pandemic plans included provisions for antiviral treatment, these pre-determined protocols required frequent updating as more information became available about the virus, and its susceptibility to antiviral agents, the epidemiology of infection, and the population groups that were most susceptible to severe disease. National public health agencies in countries with both plans for use of antivirals and pre-existing stockpiles, including those in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, operated distinctly different antiviral distribution and treatment programs from one another. In the 3 years following the pandemic, there is still little comparison of the diversity of national antiviral treatment policies and drug distribution mechanisms that were implemented, whether they had any mitigating effects and which might be most efficient. The purpose of this study is to outline roles of antiviral medicines in a pandemic period, provide insights into the diversity of antiviral treatment and distribution policies applied by selected countries between April 2009-July 2010, and to stimulate discussion on whether these policies remain appropriate for implementation in future pandemics.},

  Abstract                 = {To study the impact of the HIV epidemic on tuberculosis (TB) incidence in developing countries.A simple mathematical model is constructed using figures from published reports to estimate the rise of TB incidence as the HIV epidemic expands.Two groups with different risk of developing TB are identified: individuals with dual infection of HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the rest of the population. The model is based on a combination of the incidence and the percentage of TB in these two groups. The expected rise in TB incidence and the percentage of TB cases that will be HIV-positive are plotted against the prevalence of HIV.Unless appropriate action is taken, TB incidence in developing countries will double as the prevalence of HIV infection reaches 13 per hundred adults.95\% of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the world live in developing countries. HIV infection greatly increases the risk of developing active TB among those with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Thus researchers have used data from existing research to develop a mathematical model to gauge the increase in TB incidence in developing countries while considering rising HIV prevalence among adults. They look at 2 groups with sizable differences in risk of acquiring TB: adults with both HIV and M. tuberculosis infections and all other adults. The researchers plot the expected increase in TB incidence and percentage of TB cases that also have HIV infection against HIV prevalence. According to the model, when the prevalence of HIV infection hits 13\% of adults in developing countries, the number of new TB cases doubles. Most of this increase will occur in areas that already lack diagnostic services, drugs, hospital beds, and other needed supplies. TB chemoprophylaxis treatment of HIV-positive people could result in a lower increase in TB incidence, however. WHO has set a goal of 50\% reduction in TB incidence by 2002. Public health officials could use this model to plan TB control programs to bring about a reduction in the increase. Even though TB control programs can help stem the projected increase, it will be very difficult for developing countries with high HIV prevalence to hold back the projected rise in TB incidence. Developing countries must take considerable appropriate action soon to prevent doubling of TB incidence as HIV prevalence nears 13\% of adults.},

  Abstract                 = {Therapy of tumors expressing somatostatin receptors, sstr, has recently been clinically tested using somatostatin analogues labeled with (111)In and (90)Y. Several other radionuclides, i.e., (131)I, (161)Tb, (64)Cu, (188)Re, (177)Lu, and (67)Ga, have also been proposed for this type of therapy. The aim of this work was to investigate the usefulness of the above-mentioned radionuclides bound to somatostatin analogues for tumor therapy.Biokinetic data of (111)In-labeled octreotide in mice and man were used, primarily from our studies but sometimes from the literature. Dosimetric calculations were performed with the assumption that biokinetics were similar for all radionuclides bound to somatostatin analogues. The cumulated tumor:normal-tissue activity concentration, TNC was calculated for the various physical half-lives of the radionuclides. Using mathematical models, the tumor:normal-tissue mean absorbed dose rate ratio, TN D and tumor:normal-tissue mean absorbed dose ratio, TND, were calculated for various tumor sizes in mice and humans.TNC of radionuclide-labeled octreotide increased with physical half-life for most organs, both in mice and in humans. TN D showed that radionuclides emitting electrons with too high energy are not suitable for therapy of small tumors. Furthermore, radionuclides with a higher frequency of photon emissions relative to electron emissions will yield lower TN D and are thus less suitable for therapy than radionuclides with a lower frequency of photon emissions. The TND was highest for (161)Tb in both mice and humans.The results demonstrate that long-lived radionuclides, which emit electrons with rather low energy and which have low frequency of photon emissions, should be the preferred therapy for disseminated small sstr-expressing tumors.},

This analysis examines characteristics associated with hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection among a large group of young adult MSM from five USA cities.The Young Men's Survey was a cross-sectional prevalence study of HIV infection and related behavioural risk factors among MSM aged 15-29 years during 1994-2000. Serum specimens from HIV-negative participants were retrospectively tested for antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV). Data were stratified by ethnicity and analysed with logistic regression.Overall anti-HAV prevalence was 18.4\% among the 2708 participants, and varied by ethnicity from 6.9 to 45.3\% and was highest among Hispanic and Asian men (P < 0.001). Prevalence increased with age across all racial/ethnic groups. Among white men, anti-HAV positivity was associated with having 20 or more lifetime male sex partners for those aged 15-22 years (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=2.1, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.0-4.1) and ever having had unprotected anal sex for those aged 23-29 years (AOR=2.4, 95\% CI=1.2-4.5).Factors associated with a history of HAV infection among MSM in non-outbreak settings are probably similar to those among non-MSM. MSM are still at risk for HAV infection as a result of outbreaks occurring in MSM communities. Additional studies of hepatitis A vaccination coverage are needed to determine if strategies to vaccinate MSM are adequate.},

  Abstract                 = {Whole genome sequencing (WGS) technology holds great promise as a tool for the forensic epidemiology of bacterial pathogens. It is likely to be particularly useful for studying the transmission dynamics of an observed epidemic involving a largely unsampled 'reservoir' host, as for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in British and Irish cattle and badgers. BTB is caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the M. tuberculosis complex that also includes the aetiological agent for human TB. In this study, we identified a spatio-temporally linked group of 26 cattle and 4 badgers infected with the same Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) type of M. bovis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between sequences identified differences that were consistent with bacterial lineages being persistent on or near farms for several years, despite multiple clear whole herd tests in the interim. Comparing WGS data to mathematical models showed good correlations between genetic divergence and spatial distance, but poor correspondence to the network of cattle movements or within-herd contacts. Badger isolates showed between zero and four SNP differences from the nearest cattle isolate, providing evidence for recent transmissions between the two hosts. This is the first direct genetic evidence of M. bovis persistence on farms over multiple outbreaks with a continued, ongoing interaction with local badgers. However, despite unprecedented resolution, directionality of transmission cannot be inferred at this stage. Despite the often notoriously long timescales between time of infection and time of sampling for TB, our results suggest that WGS data alone can provide insights into TB epidemiology even where detailed contact data are not available, and that more extensive sampling and analysis will allow for quantification of the extent and direction of transmission between cattle and badgers.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in complex emergencies. Humanitarian agencies usually postpone the decision to offer TB treatment and opportunities to treat TB patients are often missed. This paper looks at the problem of tuberculosis treatment in these emergencies and questions whether treatment guidelines could be more flexible than international recommendations. A mathematical model is used to calculate the risks and benefits of different treatment scenarios with increasing default rates. Model outcomes are compared to a situation without treatment. An economic analysis further discusses the findings in a trade-off between the extra costs of treating relapses and failures and the savings in future treatment costs. In complex emergencies, if a TB programme could offer 4-month treatment for 75\% of its patients, it could still be considered beneficial in terms of public health. In addition, the proportion of patients following at least 4 months of treatment can be used as an indicator to help evaluate the public health harm and benefit of the TB programme.},

Our data also confirm that disappearance of entire elements is the main event in age-related loss of trabecular bone. In addition, our study demonstrated that Tb.Wi is lower in women than in men in the IC site, and a preferential loss of the thinner trabeculae could be seen in this group. Up to 50 years, Tb.N was found higher in women in both sites. B.Ar and Tb.Wi values are markedly higher in the TI site (+/- 15\%); Tb.N values were similar. Measured and calculated Tb.Wi values show systematic differences. In a pilot study in 14 IC biopsies with widely diverging B.Ar values, we tested the validity of several equations currently used for derived parameters in the structural analysis of cancellous bone sections. The equation for mean trabecular number passed the test, whereas the validity of the equations for mean trabecular separation and Tb.Wi appeared limited. We found anisotropy of iliac bone to increase as B.Ar decreases.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last two or three decades, growing numbers of parents in the industrialized world are choosing not to have their children vaccinated. In trying to explain why this is occurring, public health commentators refer to the activities of an anti-vaccination 'movement'. In the light of three decades of research on (new) social movements, what sense does it make to attribute decline in vaccination rates to the actions of an influential anti-vaccination movement? Two sorts of empirical data, drawn largely from UK and The Netherlands, are reviewed. These relate to the claims, actions and discourse of anti-vaccination groups on the one hand, and to the way parents of young children think about vaccines and vaccination on the other. How much theoretical sense it makes to view anti-vaccination groups as (new) social movement organizations (as distinct from pressure groups or self-help organizations) is as yet unclear. In any event there is no simple and unambiguous demarcation criterion. From a public health perspective, however, to focus attention on organized opponents of vaccination is appealing because it unites health professionals behind a banner of reason. At the same time it diverts attention from a potentially disruptive critique of vaccination practices; the critique in fact articulated by many parents. In the light of current theoretical discussion of 'scientific citizenship' this paper argues that identifying anti-vaccination groups with other social movements may ultimately have the opposite effect to that intended.},

MDR-TB and, in particular, the emergence of XDR-TB, have re-opened the debate on the importance, and nature, of treatment supervision for basic TB control and the management of drug-resistant TB. Enforcing compulsory measures regarding TB patients raises questions of respect for human rights. Yet, international law provides for rights-limiting principles, which would justify enforcing compulsory measures against TB patients who refuse to have diagnostic procedures or who refuse to be monitored and treated once disease is confirmed. This article analyzes under what circumstances compulsory measures for TB patients may be enforced under international law. Compulsory measures for TB patients may, in fact, be justified on legal grounds provided that these measures are foreseen in the law, that they are used as a last resort, and that safeguards are in place to protect affected individuals. The deadly nature of the disease, its epidemiology, the high case fatality rate, and the speed at which the disease leads to death when associated with HIV are proven.},

Because the effectiveness of interventions varies with time, it has been suggested that epidemic phases should be considered in the design of prevention strategies. This study aimed to examine the impact of HIV epidemic phases on the effectiveness of HIV interventions based on gonorrhoea screening and condom use, targeted to core groups. The results are based on a mathematical model of gonorrhoea and HIV transmission in a relatively slow spreading HIV epidemic using Cotonou (Benin) as an example. For epidemics with a low reproductive potential modest core group interventions can significantly reduce HIV incidence and prevalence. As the epidemic matures, effective interventions should also incorporate core and non-core populations. For epidemics with a high reproductive potential, core group interventions are necessary but not sufficient to have a rapid and large scale impact. A more general population approach is also needed early in the epidemic. Epidemic phases are also important in the evaluation of prevention strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {The association between bovine tuberculosis (TB) infection status based on results from the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) and milk production has been described in dairy cows in TB-infected herds in Ireland. The biological basis was uncertain, but could be related to increased TB susceptibility among lower producing dairy cows. In this study, the relationship between somatic cell count (as an objective measure of udder health) and SICTT reactivity (as a proxy for TB infection status) was investigated. Somatic cell counts of TB infected cows, both during and prior to the lactation of diagnosis of TB infection, were examined and compared to non-infected cows. All Irish dairy herds restricted from trading between June 2004 and May 2005 as a result of two or more TB reactors (test positive) to the SICTT were considered for study. Data were collected on 4340 cows from 419 herds. Previous lactation data for the cows were taken into consideration and all lactations on a cow were analysed together with the years of lactations. There was an inherent hierarchical structure in the data, with lactations nested within cows and cows within herds and so a linear mixed model with two random effects was used to describe the data. Milk production (305-day milk yield) was also included in the model as a fixed effect. The results of the study showed that for all lactations and years under investigation, somatic cell counts for SICTT reactor cows when compared to the non-reactor cows were not significantly different. In this study population, TB infection status was not associated with udder health.},

  Abstract                 = {This study describes the relationship between bovine tuberculosis (TB) and milk yield in TB-infected dairy herds in Ireland. The study had two objectives: to determine whether cows detected as TB reactors (and thus subject to immediate slaughter) were likely to be the higher milk-producing cows, and to determine whether subclinical TB infection was associated with reduced milk production at or around the time of disclosure (detection). All Irish dairy herds restricted from trading between the 1(st) June 2004 and the 31(st) May 2005 as a result of two or more TB reactors by the Single Intradermal Comparative Tuberculin Test (SICTT) were considered for study. The data consisted of 419 herds. Data were collected on all TB reactors and a random sample of 5 non-reactor cows in these herds: a data set of 4340 cows (2342 TB reactors and 1998 non-reactors). Previous milk data for the cows were taken into consideration and thus all lactations on a cow were analysed together with the years of lactations. There was an inherent hierarchical structure in the data, with lactations nested within cows and cows within herds and thus a linear mixed model with two random effects was used to describe the data. The results of this study showed that for all lactations and years under investigation, milk yield was significantly lower for TB reactor cows, with differences ranging from 120kg (2003, lactation 3) to 573kg (2001, lactation 1), when compared to the non-reactor cows.},

  Abstract                 = {Elemental mapping consists in searching the distribution of a given chemical species over an extended specimen area, with relation to topographical or structural features. It can be done with EELS core signals from a combination of several energy filtered images. One major problem encountered in the processing of such sequences of images lies in the extrapolation errors due to a difficult estimate of the background below the characteristic signal. The chosen method must be sufficiently reliable to avoid the risk of both "false positive" and "false negative" values: the first category may stem from spurious signals or from a non-satisfactory fit of the background. The second category is mainly due to a limited sensitivity. The EELS signal is often much weaker than the background intensity; an extrapolation error can therefore transform a negative value into a positive one, or vice versa. The purpose of the present contribution is to check the validity of the processing at different levels: i) different mathematical models of background; ii) different types of fitting procedures (one-parameter and two-parameters fits); iii) different fitting methods and several associated manipulations, such as a quasi local estimation of the involved fitting parameters. The statistical validity of those techniques is discussed through several tests on real images obtained from different specimens (Co/CeO2 catalysts, ferritin molecules, U and Tb staining clusters). Progress is made on the way of quantitative elemental mapping at a given confidence level, and towards the identification of single atoms.},

Molecular epidemiological studies comparing the spread of drug-resistant to that of drug-susceptible strains have yielded conflicting results: MDR strains can be up to 10 times more or 10 times less transmissible than pan-susceptible strains. Experimental work performed with model organisms has highlighted a level of complexity in the biology of bacterial drug resistance that is generally not considered during standard epidemiological studies of TB transmission. Recent experimental studies in M. tuberculosis indicate that drug resistance in this organism could be equally complex. For example, the relative fitness of drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis can be influenced by the specific drug resistance-conferring mutation and strain genetic background. Furthermore, compensatory evolution, which has been shown to mitigate the fitness defects associated with drug resistance in other bacteria, could be an important factor in the emergence and spread of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. However, much more work is needed to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms and evolutionary forces that drive drug resistance in this pathogen. Such increased knowledge will allow for better epidemiological predictions and assist in the development of new tools and strategies to fight drug-resistant TB.},

Surprisingly, DOTS has been reported to reduce the transmission of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and standardized short-course chemotherapy regimens with first-line agents have been found to be adequate treatments for some patients with drug resistant tuberculosis, including multi-drug resistance. These paradoxical observations and the apparent heterogeneity in treatment outcome of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis when using standard regimens may be due in part to limitations of in vitro drug susceptibility testing based on unique but mistakenly used techniques in diagnostic mycobacteriology. Experimental data and mathematical models indicate that the fitness cost conferred by a resistance determinant is the single most important parameter which determines the spread of drug resistance. Chromosomal alterations that result in resistance to first-line antituberculosis agents, e.g. isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, may or may not be associated with a fitness cost. Based on work in experimental models and from observations in clinical drug resistant isolates a picture emerges in which, among the various resistance mutations that appear with similar rates, those associated with the least fitness cost are selected in the population.},

Extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR) is also resistant to more than 3 of the 6 classes of second line drugs including fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. The multidrug resistance is increasing in Asia and Eastern Europe. For the moment, the phenomena is rare in France (involving 1,1\% of tuberculosis cases with 4\% of MDR tested XDR). The best preventive measure consists in a proper use of antituberculosis drugs with combined therapy including at least 3 active drugs during the first 2 months. Another challenge is to be aware of the possiblility of resistance and to prevent further transmission to other patients by airborne isolation measures, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.},

Central to these planning efforts in the health-care sector are strategies to minimise the transmission of influenza to health-care workers and patients. The infection control precautions necessary to prevent airborne, droplet, and contact transmission are quite different and will need to be decided on and planned before a pandemic occurs. Despite vast clinical experience in human beings, there continues to be much debate about how influenza is transmitted. We have done a systematic review of the English language experimental and epidemiological literature on this subject to better inform infection control planning efforts. We have found that the existing data are limited with respect to the identification of specific modes of transmission in the natural setting. However, we are able to conclude that transmission occurs at close range rather than over long distances, suggesting that airborne transmission, as traditionally defined, is unlikely to be of significance in most clinical settings. Further research is required to better define conditions under which the influenza virus may transmit via the airborne route.},

The leakage of preencapsulated Tb3+ was also measured. The analysis of the data provided estimates for the rate of aggregation C11, and the rate of fusion per se, f11. An increase in cholesterol contents results in a decrease in C11 values. Similarly, aggregation of PS/cholesterol vesicles is slower than that of PS vesicles in the presence of 650 mM NaCl. With 100 or 200 mM NaCl, the overall fusion rate of PS/cholesterol vesicles is slower than that of PS vesicles; the rate being reduced by an increase in cholesterol contents. With 600 mM NaCl, the overall fusion rate of PS/cholesterol 9:1 vesicles is faster than that of PS vesicles, and results are well-simulated by assuming no delay in vesicle aggregation up to dimers. Emerging f11 values are larger in PS/cholesterol than in PS vesicles. An analysis of fusion kinetics of several lipid concentrations shows that f11 values of PS/cholesterol 3:1 vesicles are 5-times larger than those of PS vesicles, when fusion occurs in a medium containing 200 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM Ca2+. The increase in Na+ concentration from 100 to 200 mM, or 600 mM results in a 50- or 150-fold reduction in f11 values of PS vesicles. It is suggested that incorporation of cholesterol in PS vesicles results in enhancement of Ca2+-induced fusogenic capacity.},

  Abstract                 = {The rates of dissociation of 2 equiv of various metal ions [Ca(II), Cd(II), Pr(III), Nd(III), Sm(III), Eu(III), Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), Ho(III), Er(III), Yb(III), and Lu(III)] from the primary CD and EF metal ion binding sites of parvalbumin (isotype pI = 4.75) from codfish (Gadus callarius L) were measured by stopped-flow techniques. The removal or replacement of metal ions was monitored by changes in sensitized Tb(III) luminescence or in intrinsic protein tryptophan fluorescence as quenching ions [Eu(III) or Yb(III)] were bound or removed or as the apoprotein was formed. In experiments wherein the bound metal ions were removed by mixing the parvalbumin with an excess of 1,2-diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid (DCTA), the kinetic traces were best fit by a double exponential with koff rate constants of 1.07 and 5.91 s-1 for Ca(II), 1.54 and 10.5 s-1 for Cd(II), and approximately 0.05 and approximately 0.5 s-1 for all of the trivalent lanthanide ions. In experiments wherein the bound metal ions were exchanged with an excess of a different metal ion, pseudo-first-order rate constants were proportional to the concentration of excess attacking metal ion for both the fast and slow processes in most experiments. In these cases, extrapolation of the rate constants to zero concentration of attacking metal ion gave values which agree well with the DCTA scavenging results. This finding demonstrates that the off rate constants do not depend on the occupancy of the neighboring site and therefore implies that there is no significant cooperativity in metal ion binding between the two sites in parvalbumin.},

  Abstract                 = {Proximity to an infectious TB case is a potential risk in any close contact setting. However, the rapid growth in airline transportation is in stark contrast to the lack of evidence about the prevalence of TB among airline passengers and crew. The rate of ventilation in the aircraft cabin is far superior to other forms of transportation and reduces the risk of airborne transmission.This study calculated TB disease rates among passengers and cabin crew during the 5-year study period. The principal study outcome was the number of notifications of confirmed TB disease cases and potential under-reporting was estimated. The airline rates were compared with the WHO definition of low incidence--"a TB notification rate below 10 per 100,000 population and declining".The TB case notification rate was 0.05 per 100,000 long-haul passengers. The risk increased seven-fold on flights from TB-endemic areas in Africa or India. The aircraft cabin remains classified as a low TB incidence environment on all routes within a wide margin of error. Low occupational prevalence was observed in the cabin crew workforce.Airline passengers are considered to be a select group with low TB rates. This study provides important evidence that confirms the aircraft as a low-risk setting for transmission of TB and emphasizes the presence of environmental-control measures that reduce the risk as far as possible.},

  Abstract                 = {Progress in understanding the biological processes that allow Mycobacterium tuberculosis to be a successful parasite have accelerated in the last twenty years. This progress has been stimulated by the return of tuberculosis (TB) as an important disease in industrialized countries, by its increase in emergent nations in the tail of population increases and poverty and by the spread of multiple drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis as a result of treatment failures. Progress on M. tuberculosis biology has also been fueled by advances in microbiology and molecular biology, including molecular genetics, genomics, proteomics and in vitro and in vivo models of infection. The study of latency or dormancy, a phenomenon central to understanding the persistence of M. tuberculosis and the development of TB in individuals, its spread in human populations and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant/tolerant organisms, has been preferred targets for investigators in this area. In this manner, factors that trigger M. tuberculosis latency (e. g, hypoxia, nutrient starvation, NO exposure) have been characterized and the metabolic shifts to host lipid utilization, tolerance to antimicrobials and resistance to host immune mechanisms involved in latency have been determined. Similarly, genetic changes and the resulting antimicrobial mechanisms mediating the MDR and XDR states have been characterized and potential new vaccines that avoid reactivation from latency and infection are being developed. Despite this progress, and given the fact that effective anti tuberculosis therapy was developed and first introduced clinically at the end of the 1940s, there are now more cases of latent and active TB worldwide than ever before. This reinforces the concept of TB as a bacterial disease with strong social and economical! determinants which are presently stimulating increased transmission in many human groups, undermining diagnostics, treatment and prevention. It suggests that in a scenario of global economical crisis the struggle against TB will be weakened, unless efforts are included to alleviate poverty, decrease economic inequality, improve public health and allow democracy and political organization.},

  Abstract                 = {Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis are generally thought to have high mortality rates. However, many cases can be treated with the right combination and rational use of available antituberculosis drugs. This Review describes the evidence available for each drug and discusses the basis for recommendations for the treatment of patients with MDR and XDR tuberculosis. The recommended regimen is the combination of at least four drugs to which the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate is likely to be susceptible. Drugs are chosen with a stepwise selection process through five groups on the basis of efficacy, safety, and cost. Among the first group (the oral first-line drugs) high-dose isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol are thought of as an adjunct for the treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis. The second group is the fluoroquinolones, of which the first choice is high-dose levofloxacin. The third group are the injectable drugs, which should be used in the following order: capreomycin, kanamycin, then amikacin. The fourth group are called the second-line drugs and should be used in the following order: thioamides, cycloserine, then aminosalicylic acid. The fifth group includes drugs that are not very effective or for which there are sparse clinical data. Drugs in group five should be used in the following order: clofazimine, amoxicillin with clavulanate, linezolid, carbapenems, thioacetazone, then clarithromycin.},

The objective of this study is to develop a model to estimate the average cost per measles case and per adverse event following measles immunisation using the Netherlands (NL), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada as examples.Parameter estimates were based on a review of the published literature. A decision tree was built to represent the complications associated with measles cases and adverse events following immunisation. Monte-Carlo Simulation techniques were used to account for uncertainty.From the perspective of society, we estimated the average cost per measles case to be US$276, US$307 and US$254 for the NL, the UK and Canada, respectively, and the average cost of adverse events following immunisation per vaccinee to be US$1.43, US$1.93 and US$1.51 for the NL, UK and Canada, respectively.These average cost estimates could be combined with incidence estimates and costs of immunisation programmes to provide estimates of the cost of measles to industrialised countries.

  Abstract                 = {The incidence of reported pertussis has increased during the past decade and poses a growing health and economic burden in developed countries, despite high rates of primary vaccination. Administration of a booster dose of acellular pertussis vaccine to adolescents may help reduce this burden, not only by reducing infections in vaccinated individuals but also by reducing transmission of Bordetella pertussis to other individuals, particularly infants. An epidemiologic model was created to assess the health and economic impact of implementing a program of routine acellular pertussis immunization in adolescents 11-18 years of age in the United States, considering both the reduction in cases in those vaccinated and among the unvaccinated population (due to herd immunity). Inputs for the base case were defined according to information derived from published literature and were supplemented by estimates provided by members of the Global Pertussis Initiative. Both direct and indirect costs were included (in 2002 US dollars) using U.S. data. Outcomes were evaluated over the lifetime of a cohort of potential adolescent vaccine candidates. Because of uncertainty in many of the inputs, extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. With 80\% vaccination coverage of adolescents and a 20\% reduction of other cases because of herd immunity, >68,000 cases and 41 pertussis-related deaths would be avoided in the subsequent 10 years by routine administration of acellular pertussis boosters to a single cohort of adolescents in the United States. This strategy would be cost-effective, incurring from 6000 US dollars to 22,000 US dollars per life-year gained. The level of herd immunity attained and the true incidence of pertussis are critical determinants of cost effectiveness, as is the duration of immunity resulting from immunization. The cost of immunization and the discount rate also play a role. Although there is considerable uncertainty surrounding key inputs, the results indicate that the conditions required for adolescent immunization to be economically warranted are realistic.},

The authors reviewed published studies describing the course of influenza virus infection in placebo-treated and untreated volunteers challenged with wild-type influenza virus. A total of 56 different studies with 1,280 healthy participants were considered. Viral shedding increased sharply between 0.5 and 1 day after challenge and consistently peaked on day 2. The duration of viral shedding averaged over 375 participants was 4.80 days (95\% confidence interval: 4.31, 5.29). The frequency of symptomatic infection was 66.9\% (95\% confidence interval: 58.3, 74.5). Fever was observed in 37.0\% of A/H1N1, 40.6\% of A/H3N2 (p = 0.86), and 7.5\% of B infections (p = 0.001). The total symptoms scores increased on day 1 and peaked on day 3. Systemic symptoms peaked on day 2. No such data exist for children or elderly subjects, but epidemiologic studies suggest that the natural history might differ. The present analysis confirms prior expert opinion on the duration of viral shedding or the frequency of asymptomatic influenza infection, extends prior knowledge on the dynamics of viral shedding and symptoms, and provides original results on the frequency of respiratory symptoms or fever.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis has re-emerged as a public health concern in high-income countries in the last few decades. The European region accounts for only 5\% of world TB cases. The incidence of new TB cases in Europe varies from very low rates in Scandinavian countries (six to eight cases/100,000 population) to rates as high as 231 cases/100,000 population in Tajikistan; the Russian Federation is eleventh among the 22 high-burden TB countries. The estimated detection rate of new sputum smear-positive pulmonary cases and the treatment success rate in 2007 were poor compared with other WHO regions: 51\% of cases were diagnosed and 70\% of them completed a full course of anti-TB therapy, which is still a long way from the World Health Assembly targets (detection of 70\% of infectious cases and successful treatment of 85\% of them). The low success rate is largely attributable to the increasing number of drug-resistant TB cases: Eastern European countries are among those with the highest rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB (TB resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid) in the world. By the end of September 2009, at least one case of extensively drug-resistant TB (named XDR-TB and defined as a MDR-TB strain with additional resistance to any fluoroquinolone, and to at least one of three injectable drugs used in anti-TB treatment) had been reported by 25 countries in the WHO European Region. In Western Europe, TB continues to cause disease among elderly native-born individuals, although high-risk groups including immigrants, prisoners, HIV-infected persons and drug addicts significantly contribute to the overall burden. Improved TB control in Europe requires a large coordinated effort by all stakeholders, including governments, governmental and non-governmental institutions, as well as the academic and private sectors and affected communities.},

Proposed definitions are ambiguous, and extensive drug resistance is encompassed by the already defined extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. There is no evidence that proposed totally resistant TB differs from strains encompassed by XDR TB. Susceptibility tests for several drugs are poorly reproducible. Few laboratories can test all drugs, and there is no consensus list of all anti-TB drugs. Many drugs are used off-label for highly drug resistant TB, and new drugs formulated to combat resistant strains would render the proposed category obsolete. Labeling TB strains as totally drug resistant might lead providers to think infected patients are untreatable. These challenges must be addressed before defining a new category for highly drug-resistant TB.},

  Abstract                 = {Nigeria is one of only four countries that have never interrupted poliovirus transmission (the others are Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan). A resurgence in wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission occurred in Nigeria during 2003-2004 after a loss of public confidence in oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and suspension of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs)* in several northern states. Subsequently, WPV spread within Nigeria and ultimately into 20 previously polio-free countries during 2003-2006. Even after national SIAs resumed, limited acceptance and ongoing operational problems resulted in low polio vaccination coverage and continued WPV transmission. Beginning in 2006, health authorities in Nigeria introduced new initiatives to control the spread of WPV, including a focus on interrupting type 1 WPV (WPV1) transmission and use of monovalent type 1 OPV (mOPV1) for most of the SIAs to increase vaccine effectiveness. Nigeria also instituted changes in SIA implementation to increase community acceptance of vaccination. Subsequently, 285 polio cases were reported in Nigeria in 2007, the lowest number since sensitive surveillance has been in place. As of August 12, 2008, confirmed polio cases reported in Nigeria totaled 556 (including 511 WPV1 cases), compared with 176 cases (53 WPV1) reported during the same period in 2007. This report updates overall progress toward polio eradication in Nigeria during 2007-2008. Given the increase in WPV transmission thus far in 2008, urgent measures are needed to reach all children during SIAs to bring WPV under control in Nigeria.},

Asp kinase is an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of 4-phospho-L-aspartate from L-aspartate and involved in the branched biosynthetic pathway leading to the synthesis of amino acids lysine, threonine, methionine and isoleucine. An intermediate of lysine biosynthetic branch, mesodiaminopimelate is also a component of the peptidoglycan which is a component of bacterial cell wall. To interfere with the production of all these amino acids and cell wall, it is possible to inhibit Asp kinase activity. This can be achieved using Asp kinase inhibitors. In order to design novel Asp kinase inhibitors as effective anti-TB drugs, it is necessary to have an understanding of the binding sites of Asp kinase. As no crystal structure of the enzyme has yet been published, we built a homology model of Asp kinase using the crystallized Asp kinase from M. Jannaschii, as template structures (2HMF and 3C1M). After the molecular dynamics refinement, the optimized homology model was assessed as a reliable structure by PROCHECK, ERRAT, WHAT-IF, PROSA2003 and VERIFY-3D. The results of molecular docking studies with natural substrates, products and feedback inhibitors are in agreement with the published data and showed that ACT domain plays an important role in binding to ligands. Based on the docking conformations, pharmacophore model can be developed by probing the common features of ligands. By analyzing the results, ACT domain architecture, certain key residues that are responsible for binding to feedback inhibitors and natural substrates were identified. This would be very helpful in understanding the blockade mechanism of Asp kinase and providing insights into rational design of novel Asp kinase inhibitors for M.tuberculosis.},

  abstract    = {Drug-resistant tuberculosis has brought back the spectre of pre-antibiotic days. WHO surveillance data from 2007 showed multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)-tubercle bacillus resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin accounting for 4.8\% of all new and subsequent cases of tuberculosis. India and China-the two most populated countries of the world, house the maximum number of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases. In eastern European and central Asian countries, more than 6\% of new TB cases are MDR-TB, whereas the number is <3\% in the countries of the western world. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has emerged with the prospect of tuberculosis becoming an incurable disease. A surveillance spreading over the six continents showed 10\% of MDR-TB cases were also XDR-TB. The fact that tuberculosis is the most common opportunistic infection among HIV-infected patients in developing countries makes the challenge almost insurmountable. The mortality of HIV and MDR-TB co-infected patients is exceedingly high. The absence of guidelines for treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis and of infrastructure for delivery of DOT program and rapid laboratory diagnostic facilities, including drug susceptibility testing for both first and second-line drugs, and lack of trained human resource in most of the developing world account for the emergence and perpetuation of this menacing problem. WHO along with partnership with Green Light Committee and individual national governments has started DOT plus program to control this global epidemic.},

These two forms of highly drug-resistant TB threaten to make TB into an untreatable and highly fatal disease, particularly in resource-poor countries with a high prevalence of AIDS. The focus of this review is to highlight the current extent of the problem.There is a great variability in clinical outcomes for MDR-TB, in part due to differences in the definitions of outcome measures and retrospective nature of the studies. Outcomes for XDR-TB are uniformly worse than those for MDR-TB.A multifaceted approach is needed to prevent a more widespread epidemic of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Rapid diagnostic assays to detect highly drug-resistant TB are essential in preventing delays in treatment of MDR-TB and XDR-TB and curbing their spread. Development of new drugs to effectively treat all forms of TB in a shorter period of time is urgently needed.},

  Abstract                 = {Several molecules related to antigen presentation, including gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), are encoded by polymorphic genes. Some polymorphisms were found to affect susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) when they were considered singly in epidemiological studies, but how multiple polymorphisms interact to determine susceptibility to TB in an individual remains an open question. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in some genes may counteract or intensify the effects of polymorphisms in other genes. For example, an increase in IFN-gamma expression may counteract the weak binding that a particular MHC variant displays for a peptide from Mycobacterium tuberculosis to establish the same T-cell response as another, more strongly binding MHC variant. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model of antigen presentation based on experimental data for the known effects of genetic polymorphisms and simulated time courses when multiple polymorphisms were present. We found that polymorphisms in different genes could affect antigen presentation to the same extent and therefore compensate for each other. Furthermore, we defined the conditions under which such relationships could exist. For example, increased IFN-gamma expression compensated for decreased peptide-MHC affinity in the model only above a certain threshold of expression. Below this threshold, changes in IFN-gamma expression were ineffectual compared to changes in peptide-MHC affinity. The finding that polymorphisms exhibit such relationships could explain discrepancies in the epidemiological literature, where some polymorphisms have been inconsistently associated with susceptibility to TB. Furthermore, the model allows polymorphisms to be ranked by effect, providing a new tool for designing association studies.},

  abstract    = {Osteoporosis is now defined as a disease characterized by a decreased bone mass associated with micro-architectural modification of trabecular bone leading to an increased fragility and to bone fractures. Various histomorphometric methods have been described to measure bone architecture on histological sections. However, not all of methods are strictly equivalent and some of them appear able to detect differences earlier in the course of the disease. We have compared 8 histomorphometric methods known to characterize the architecture of trabecular bone in 55 male osteoporotic patients. Measurements were done on transiliac bone biopsies: Trabecular number, thickness and separation (Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp); Trabecular Bone Pattern Factor (TBPf); Euler-Poincaré's number (E); Interconnectivity Index (ICI); strut analysis of the trabecular network with the ratio of nodes/free-end (N/F); star volume of the bone marrow (Vm) and trabeculae (Vtrab) and the Kolmogorov fractal dimension of the trabecular boundaries (D). Relationships between the various architectural parameters were studied by hierarchical cluster analysis. Linear, hyperbolic and exponential correlations were found between trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) and architectural parameters. Cluster analysis demonstrates the link between these architectural parameters. ICI, E and TBPf which reflect the amount of open/closed marrow cavities clustered together and appeared related to Tb.Sp, which are indicators of the mean size of marrow cavities. Tb.Th, Vm and N/F flocked together as they reflect the trabecular size. Tb.N and D segregated together and seemed to best describe the trabecular network complexity. These histomorphometric techniques are correlated but correlations may be linear or non linear. Several histomorphometric techniques need to be used in parallel to appreciate the pathophysiological mechanisms of osteoporotic states.},

In fact, at the end of December 1990, it achieved 110.6\% for DPT3, 142.16\% for OPV3, 151.96\% for BCG, and 97\% for measles. UIP was able to surpass its targets by emphasizing team work. Government, the private sector, UNICEF, and the voluntary sector made up the Apex Coordination Committee on Immunization headed up by the mayor. The committee drafted an action plan which included routine immunization sessions on a fixed day and intensive immunization drives. Further the involved organizations pooled together cold chain equipment. In addition, the District Family Welfare Bureau was the distribution center for vaccines, syringes, immunization cards, report formats, vaccine carriers, and ice packs. Health workers administered immunizations from about 300 centers generally on Wednesday, National Immunization Day. Intensive immunization drives focused on measles immunizations. UIP leaders encouraged all center to routinely record coverage and submit monthly progress reports to the District Family Welfare Bureau. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation coordinated promotion activities and social mobilization efforts. Promotion included radio and TV announcements, newspaper advertisements, cinema slides, billboards, and posters. The original UIP plan to use professional communicators to mobilize communities was ineffective, so nongovernmental organizations entered the slums to encourage people to encourage their neighbors to immunize their children. Further Islamic, Protestant, and Catholic leaders encouraged the faithful to immunize their children. A UNICEF officer noted that this success must be sustained, however.},

  Abstract                 = {In a population of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, random chromosomal mutation that results in genetic resistance to anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs occurs at a relatively low frequency. Anti-TB drugs impose selection pressure so that mycobacterial mutants gradually outnumber susceptible bacilli and emerge as the dominant strains. Resistance to two or more anti-TB drugs represents cumulative results of sequential mutation. The fourth report on global anti-TB drug resistance provides the latest data on the extent of such problem in the world. The median prevalence of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in new TB cases was 1.6\%, and in previously treated TB cases 11.7\%. Of the half a million MDR-TB cases estimated to have emerged in 2006, 50\% were in China and India. The optimal duration of any given combination of anti-TB drugs for treatment of MDR- and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has not been defined in controlled clinical trials. Standardized treatment may be feasible for MDR-TB patients not previously treated with second-line drugs, but a different strategy needs to be applied in the treatment of MDR-TB patients who have received second-line drugs before. Unfortunately, the reliability of drug susceptibility testing of most second-line anti-TB drugs is still questionable. Drug-resistant TB is not necessarily less virulent. Findings from modelling exercise warned that if MDR-TB case detection and treatment rates increase to the World Health Organization target of 70\%, without simultaneously increasing MDR-TB cure rates, XDR-TB prevalence could increase exponentially. Prevention of development of drug resistance must be accorded the top priority in the era of MDR-/XDR-TB.},

Potential risk factors associated with the readmission were recorded during hospital stay and follow-up visits, including age, sex, length of stay, substance abuse, need of assistance in the activities of daily living (ADL), comorbidities, non-compliance, drug complications and use of non-standard drug regimen.Up to 20.1\% of patients were readmitted. Factors independently associated with early unplanned readmission were need of assistance in ADL, drug complications, the need to use a non-standard drug regimen and more than three non-chest comorbidities.A significant readmission rate was found in these patients and potential risk factors were identified. Ambulatory treatment for TB may not be appropriate for selected patients. Local guidelines for the management of TB patients at high risk of readmission is needed.},

  Abstract                 = {Vaccine safety is increasingly a major aspect of immunization programmes. Parents are becoming more aware of safety issues relating to vaccines their babies might receive. As a consequence, public health initiatives have had to take note of pressures brought to bear by individual parents and groups. Now we document a new phase in vaccine safety where it has been used to achieve political objectives. In 1988, the World Health Assembly declared its intention to eradicate poliomyelitis from the globe by the year 2000. This goal had to be postponed to 2005 for a number of reasons. Although the progress has been spectacular in achieving eradication in almost all nations and areas, the goal has been tantalizingly elusive. But arguably the most difficult country from which to eradicate the virus has been Nigeria. Over the past two years, tension has arisen in the north against immunizing against polio using the oral polio vaccine (OPV). Although this vaccine has been used in every other country in the world including other Muslim states, some religious leaders in the north found reason in August 2003 to advise their followers not to have their children vaccinated with OPV. Subsequent to this boycott, which the Kano governor had endorsed for a year and then ended in July 2004, cases of polio occurred in African nations previously free of the virus, and the DNA finger-print of the virus indicated it had come from Nigeria. In other words, Nigeria became a net exporter of polio virus to its African neighbours and beyond. Now the disease has spread to a dozen formerly polio-free countries, including Sudan and Indonesia. We show that, while the outward manifestations of the northern Nigerian intransigence were that of distrust of vaccine, the underlying problem was actually part of a longstanding dispute about political and religious power vis a vis Abuja. It is unlikely that polio transmission will be interrupted by 2005 if this dispute is allowed to run its course.},

In approximately half the countries where resistance has been reported, estimates are based on surveys conducted in public sector facilities. However, in locations where a substantial fraction of TB cases seek care with private providers, these surveys may not accurately measure resistance in the entire population.We describe a mathematical model to investigate biases associated with sampling only from public sector cases in India, where TB treatment is offered in both public and private sectors. We then propose and demonstrate a weighted estimator as an efficient method for including small numbers of cases from the private sector as a way to recover valid estimates of resistance in the population under study.We find that public sector surveys rarely provide valid estimates of drug-resistance among new and retreatment cases. Further, the magnitude and direction of the bias are sensitive to many parameters describing the health-seeking behaviours and treatment outcomes of tuberculosis patients, disallowing simple adjustments to recover accurate estimates.In locations where large numbers of tuberculosis patients are diagnosed and treated by private sector practitioners who are not typically included in drug resistance surveys, targeted surveys for assessing drug resistance are required to validly estimate resistance.},

Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for HIV-TB coinfected individuals reduces the reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections and is being evaluated as a potential community-wide strategy for improving TB control. We developed a mathematical model of TB/HIV coepidemics to examine the impact of community-wide implementation of IPT for TB-HIV coinfected individuals on the dynamics of drug-sensitive and -resistant TB epidemics. We found that community-wide IPT will reduce the incidence of TB in the short-term but may also speed the emergence of drug-resistant TB. We conclude that community-wide IPT in areas of emerging HIV and drug-resistant TB should be coupled with diagnostic and treatment policies designed to identify and effectively treat the increasing proportion of patients with drug-resistant TB.},

While antibiotic resistance is cited as a potential threat to efforts aimed at controlling the spread of this pathogen, it is not clear how drug resistance affects disease dynamics. The effect of mutational events that lead to antibiotic-resistant phenotypes may or may not have a predictable effect on the fitness of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains. Here, we review the literature on laboratory studies of the fitness of drug-resistant tuberculosis, we examine the evidence from cluster studies, and we consider the effect of drug resistance on disease dynamics in mathematical models. On the basis of these diverse lines of evidence, we conclude that the fitness estimates of drug-resistant M tuberculosis are quite heterogeneous and that this variation may preclude our ability to predict future trends of this pathogen.},

When investigating the resurgence of TB it is very important epidemiologically to take into account the influence of AIDS prevalence on TB. This paper develops a procedure establishing HIV prevalence in TB for people in Armenia, Quindío, by using a mathematical model. This was done by building two deterministic models and relating them through a linear transfer function model. To parameters involved in these models had to be estimated to relate them; a technique was then built from unbiased estimators of minimum variance and secondary information for the parameters of each disease, taking into account the town's Secretariat of Health's secondary information. The model for Armenia led to concluding that tuberculosis resulted from people who had suffered from tuberculosis 4 periods (trimesters) ago and those sick from AIDS 2 periods ago, including the present. The procedure described in this work was seen to be applicable to the pathologies to which it is related.},

Further analysis of key statistics associated with each of the countries shows the impact of different indicators. As expected, HIV is a key driver of TB epidemics and affects their age-distribution and their scale. The level of development of a country and its wealth also vary with the shape and scale of a country's TB epidemic. Immigration has an influence on the shape of TB epidemics, which is particularly pronounced in highly developed countries with low levels of TB disease in the native population.

The model is used to compare the effectiveness of TB chemotherapy with three strategies for prevention: highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the treatment of latent TB infection (TLTI) and the reduction of HIV transmission.Even where the prevalence of HIV infection is high, finding and curing active TB is the most effective way to minimize the number of TB cases and deaths over the next 10 years. HAART can be as effective, but only with very high levels of coverage and compliance. TLTI is comparatively ineffective over all time scales. Reducing HIV incidence is relatively ineffective in preventing TB and TB deaths over 10 years but is much more effective over 20 years.In countries where the spread of HIV has led to a substantial increase in the incidence of TB, TB control programmes should maintain a strong emphasis on the treatment of active TB. To ensure effective control of TB in the longer term, methods of TB prevention should be carried out in addition to, but not as a substitute for, treating active cases.},

HAT were included. The patients were evaluated using a standardized clinical evaluation and a specific interview on sleep complaints. Diagnosis of stages I and II and intermediate stage was performed by CSF cell count and/or presence of trypanosomes: 4 patients were classified as stage II, 13 stage I, and 8 "intermediate" stage. Seventeen untreated patients completed continuous 24-hour polysomnography. We measured CSF levels of hypocretin-1 in all patients at different stages and evolutions, and we compared the results with 26 patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy and 53 neurologic controls.CSF hypocretin-1 levels were significantly higher in T.b.g. HAT (423.2 +/- 119.7 pg/mL) than in narcoleptic patients (40.16 +/- 60.18 pg/ mL) but lower than in neurologic controls (517.32 +/- 194.5 pg/mL). One stage I patient had undetectable hypocretin levels and 1 stage II patient showed intermediate levels, both patients (out of three patients) reporting excessive daytime sleepiness but without evidence for an association with narcolepsy. No differences were found in CSF hypocretin levels between patients with HAT stages; however, the presence of major sleep-wake cycle disruptions was significantly associated with lower CSF hypocretin-1 level with a same tendency for the number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods.The present investigation is not in favor of a unique implication of the hypocretin system in T.b.g. HAT. However, we propose that dysfunction of the hypothalamic hypocretin region may participate in sleep disturbances observed in African trypanosomiasis.},

The same phenomenon likely holds for interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs).A mathematical model of LTBI test specificity was developed using elementary probability theory. Implications for IGRA study design, and data collection and analysis are presented.The model demonstrates that the specificity of any test for LTBI is theoretically affected by its sensitivity to active TB, and by the distribution of TB, LTBI and healthy controls. Moreover, changing cut-off points to increase the sensitivity for active TB will cause a decline in the specificity for LTBI. Published data are used to demonstrate these counterintuitive results.As a result of the markedly dissimilar health statuses associated with a negative LTBI test, IGRA specificity for LTBI and sensitivity to active TB depend upon TB and LTBI prevalence. A trade-off exists between the specificity of IGRAs to LTBI and sensitivity to active TB. Field studies of IGRAs will require standardized collection of symptoms of active TB to distinguish LTBI suspects from TB suspects. Different cut-off points for IGRA use in TB suspects and LTBI suspects will likely be needed.},

The virus was a Pan-Asia O strain that caused few lesions in sheep and this made the identification of infected flocks very difficult leading to a long drawn-out epidemic. Over four million animals were slaughtered in 2000 herds and flocks. The last outbreak was in September.}

However, this traditional view has been challenged recently, largely due to the evidence originating from the M. marinum-zebrafish model. As a genetically tractable model, zebrafish provide unprecedented opportunities to address the pathogenesis of tuberculosis from a systems biology perspective. The latest data from this model are summarized in this review, special attention is given to the shared pathway and network between zebrafish and humans.

In the 2 1/2-year period following initiation of the vaccination campaign in September 1980, 83\% of children in the target population were covered and no cases of paralytic poliomyelitis were reported from the area. This coverage rate of 83\% stands in contrast with the 64\% rate obtained in Bombay's Ward B, a residential area for middle and upper-income people, and the 70\% rate in Ward E, another slum district where household visits were not conducted. This experience demonstrates that it is possible to abolish paralytic poliomyelitis through adequate vaccination coverage even in slum areas located in the middle of highly endemic areas. Experience further demonstrated that it is not necessary to withhold oral polio vaccine from children with minor illnesses such as diarrhea or immediately before or after breastfeeding. These 2 contraindications have in the past increased the difficulty of obtaining adequate vaccine coverage rates among young children.},

To test the usefulness of the design rules, we consider as a case study the map-labeling problem, an NP-hard problem from cartography. We compare the predictions of the theoretical models with the actual performance of the GA for the map-labeling problem. Experiments show that the predictions match the observed scale-up behavior of the GA, thereby strengthening our claim that the design rules can guide the design of competent selecto-recombinative GAs for realistic problems.},

These assays have been evaluated in low incidence countries, mainly in adults, and have been shown to be more specific than TST. Because few studies have been done in high incidence countries, and because paediatric data are limited, we compared a whole-blood IFN-gamma assay with TST among hospitalized Indian children.Between July 2004 and June 2005, a total of 105 consecutively admitted children (median age 6 years; 82\% had BCG scars) in whom TB was suspected or had history of contact with an index case were recruited at a rural hospital in India. All children underwent TST, and the QuantiFERON-TB-Gold In Tube (QFT) assay.The overall prevalence of TB infection was similar with both tests. With a TST cut-off point of > or =10mm, 10 of 105 (9.5\%; 95\% CI 3.8, 15.2) children were TST positive. With a cut-off point of IFN-gamma> or =0.35IU/ml, 11 of 105 (10.5\%; 95\% CI 4.5, 16.4) were QFT positive. The concordance between TST and QFT was substantial (agreement 95.2\%; kappa [kappa] 0.73; 95\% CI for kappa 0.53, 0.92). Agreement between TST and QFT results was 100\% (kappa 1.0) in BCG scar-negative children as compared to 94\% (kappa 0.63) in scar-positive children. BCG was not associated with the results of either TST or QFT (P>0.05 for both tests). The number of children with bacteriologically confirmed active TB was too small to permit the estimation of sensitivity of the tests.In a rural, predominantly BCG-vaccinated paediatric population in India, the TST and QFT assay produced comparable results.

  Abstract                 = {The transmission of tuberculosis is a recognized risk in health-care settings. Several recent outbreaks of tuberculosis in health-care settings, including outbreaks involving multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have heightened concern about nosocomial transmission. In addition, increases in tuberculosis cases in many areas are related to the high risk of tuberculosis among persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Transmission of tuberculosis to persons with HIV infection is of particular concern because they are at high risk of developing active tuberculosis if infected. Health-care workers should be particularly alert to the need for preventing tuberculosis transmission in settings in which persons with HIV infection receive care, especially settings in which cough-inducing procedures (e.g., sputum induction and aerosolized pentamidine [AP] treatments) are being performed. Transmission is most likely to occur from patients with unrecognized pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis who are not on effective antituberculosis therapy and have not been placed in tuberculosis (acid-fast bacilli [AFB]) isolation. Health-care facilities in which persons at high risk for tuberculosis work or receive care should periodically review their tuberculosis policies and procedures, and determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk of tuberculosis transmission in their particular settings. The prevention of tuberculosis transmission in health-care settings requires that all of the following basic approaches be used: a) prevention of the generation of infectious airborne particles (droplet nuclei) by early identification and treatment of persons with tuberculous infection and active tuberculosis, b) prevention of the spread of infectious droplet nuclei into the general air circulation by applying source-control methods, c) reduction of the number of infectious droplet nuclei in air contaminated with them, and d) surveillance of health-care-facility personnel for tuberculosis and tuberculous infection. Experience has shown that when inadequate attention is given to any of these approaches, the probability of tuberculosis transmission is increased. Specific actions to reduce the risk of tuberculosis transmission should include a) screening patients for active tuberculosis and tuberculous infection, b) providing rapid diagnostic services, c) prescribing appropriate curative and preventive therapy, d) maintaining physical measures to reduce microbial contamination of the air, e) providing isolation rooms for persons with, or suspected of having, infectious tuberculosis, f) screening health-care-facility personnel for tuberculous infection and tuberculosis, and g) promptly investigating and controlling outbreaks. Although completely eliminating the risk of tuberculosis transmission in all health-care settings may be impossible, adhering to these guidelines should minimize the risk to persons in these settings.},

However, little information is available for poliomyelitis-related CFR in developing countries. We conducted a study to determine the CFR in India, 1 of the 4 remaining countries with endemic wild poliovirus (WPV) circulation, during outbreaks of WPV infection during 2002 and 2006 and during the inter-epidemic years of 2003-2005.We conducted a descriptive analysis with use of data from the acute flaccid paralysis surveillance system in India. Variables analyzed included age, caregiver-reported vaccination status, date of paralysis onset, laboratory results, final case classification, and survival outcome. Our analysis also accounted for surveillance changes that occurred in 2005, impacting case definitions and final classification.In 2006, 45 deaths occurred among 676 WPV cases in India, yielding a CFR of 6.7\%. By comparison, in 2002, there were 66 deaths among 1600 reported WPV cases (CFR, 4.2\%) and during 2002-2005, CFR was 1.5\%-5.2\%. All 45 deaths were among 644 (95\%) WPV cases in children aged <5 years (CFR, 7.0\%). Among those who died, 33 (73\%) were children aged <2 years (CFR, 7.1\%).The CFR among children aged <2 years in India is high compared with previously published CFRs for young children, in part because of improved case finding through enhanced surveillance techniques. Fatal cases emphasize the lethal nature of the disease and the importance of achieving polio eradication in India.},

Diagnostic capacity during these phases is limited.To estimate the population-level impact of TB case-finding strategies in the presence of subclinical and prediagnostic disease.We created a mathematical epidemic model of TB, calibrated to global incidence. We then introduced three prototypical diagnostic interventions: increased sensitivity of diagnosis in the clinical phase by 20\% ("passive"); early diagnosis during the prediagnostic phase at a rate of 10\% per year ("enhanced"); and population-based diagnosis of 5\% of undiagnosed prevalent cases per year ("active").If the subclinical phase was ignored, as in most models, the passive strategy was projected to reduce TB incidence by 18\% (90\% uncertainty range [UR], 11-32\%) by year 10, compared with 23\% (90\% UR, 14-35\%) for the enhanced strategy and 18\% (90\% UR, 11-28\%) for the active strategy. After incorporating a subclinical phase into the model, consistent with population-based prevalence surveys, the active strategy still reduced 10-year TB incidence by 16\% (90\% UR, 11-28\%), but the passive and enhanced strategies' impact was attenuated to 11\% (90\% UR, 8-25\%) and 6\% (90\% UR, 4-13\%), respectively. The degree of attenuation depended strongly on the transmission rate during the subclinical phase.Subclinical disease may limit the impact of current diagnostic strategies for TB. Active detection of undiagnosed prevalent cases may achieve greater population-level TB control than increasing passive case detection.},

Expanding access to culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) for TB diagnosis may help control this epidemic, but the potential impact of existing and novel TB diagnostics is uncertain. By fitting to World Health Organization epidemiological estimates, we developed a compartmental difference-equation model of the TB/HIV epidemic among South African adults. Performing culture and DST in 37\% of new cases and 85\% of previously treated cases was projected to save 47,955 lives (17.2\% reduction in TB mortality, 95\% simulation interval (S.I.) 8.9-24.4\%), avert 7,721 MDR-TB cases (14.1\% reduction, 95\% S.I. 5.3-23.8\%), and prevent 46.6\% of MDR-TB deaths (95\% S.I. 32.6-56.0\%) in South Africa over 10 years. Used alone, expanded culture and DST did not reduce XDR-TB incidence, but they enhanced the impact of transmission-reduction strategies, such as respiratory isolation. In South Africa, expanding TB culture and DST could substantially reduce TB, and particularly MDR-TB, mortality. Control of XDR-TB will require additional interventions, the impact of which may be enhanced by improved TB diagnosis.},

Sensitivity analyses assessed the influence of each model parameter on the interventions' mortality impact.Enhanced diagnostic techniques (rapid molecular testing or culture) are each projected to reduce TB prevalence and mortality by 20\% or more, an impact similar to that of active case-finding in 33\% of the general community and greater than the effect achievable by case-finding or antiretroviral treatment efforts in HIV-positive patients alone. The projected impact of enhanced diagnostics on TB incidence (< 10\% reduction) is smaller. The impact of TB diagnostics is sensitive to the quality of existing diagnostic standards and the level of access to diagnostic services, but is robust across a wide range of population parameters including HIV and TB incidence.Enhanced TB diagnostic techniques may have substantial impact on TB morbidity and mortality in HIV-endemic regions. As TB rates continue to increase in these areas, enhanced diagnostic techniques merit further consideration as TB control strategies.},

At pH 5.5 there are six specific Gd(III)-binding sites on the IgG. These six sites can be divided into two classes; two very 'tight' sites on the Fc fragment (Kd approx. 5 muM) and two weaker sites on each Fab region (Kd approx. 140 muM). Ca(II) does not apparently compete for these metal-binding sites. The metal-binding parameters for IgG can be explained as the sum of the metal binding to the isolated Fab and Fc fragments, suggesting that there is no apparent interaction between the Fab and Fc regions in the IgG molecule. The binding of Gd(III) to Fab and Fc fragments was also monitored by measuring changes in the electron-spin-resonance spectrum of Gd(III) in the presence of each fragment and also by monitoring the effects of Gd(III) on the protein fluorescence at 340 nm (excitation 295 nm). The fluorescence of Tb(III) solutions of 545 nm (excitation 295 nm) is enhanced slightly on addition of Fab or Fc.},

Inequities in cervical cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment and HPV vaccination may arise from a number of barriers including access to healthcare, cultural beliefs, and limited awareness of options.Initiatives to promote uptake of prophylactic HPV vaccination that target high-risk women need to be implemented before existing disparities widen. Although acceptability of HPV vaccination is promising, uptake is still low among low-income populations and specific racial/ethnic minorities. To address limited vaccine uptake it may be beneficial to establish national/state guidelines as well as culturally relevant interventions at the individual and community levels.

The recurring outbreaks of yellow fever in regions where it has been absent, as well as the absence of yellow fever in regions where the vectors exist are discussed. Features of vaccination are discussed, including the long persistence of humoral antibodies and long duration of effective protection. The possibility of changes in virulence of yellow fever strains is mentioned. In some of the modern outbreaks, virulence for human beings appears to be lower than virulence noted some centuries ago, and a hypothesis is advanced. The possible influence of virus-protecting antibodies acquired by infection by other flaviviruses is mentioned. With respect to the vectors of yellow fever, the possibility of differing susceptibility and of different behaviour of various strains is discussed. Transovarial transmission of the virus in the vector mosquito is mentioned as a possible mechanism for long persistence of the virus in nature. Infection of ticks and transovarial transmission of virus in ticks are also mentioned. The need for a diagnostic test to differentiate immunity produced by a naturally acquired infection from immunity induced by vaccination is stressed.},

The second phase of the study took place within a modern "up to date" operating room suite containing multiple air screens as well as an elaborate ventilation system utilizing HEPA type filters which provided the operating room with clinically sterile air. One hundred and fifty-six patients were also studied. All patients underwent major procedures. The ratio of clean, clean-contaminated, and dirty cases was the same in both groups. Preoperatively, a nasal swab, clean voided urine (or vaginal swab) and a rectal swab were obtained on each patient. Daily nasal cultures and cultures of suspected sites of infection were obtained postoperatively. Daily nasal cultures and "glove sweat" cultures were obtained on all personnel attending the patient. Environmental cultures of the operating room, the operating room hallway, recovery room and patients' rooms were also taken. All samples were checked for the presence of staphylococci, streptococci, Escherichia coli, proteus species, enterobacter, klebsiella, and pseudomonas. In all, 15,000 cultures were taken during the study. The rate of infection was essentially the same in both phases of the study. Environmental air only occasionaly served as the source of infecting organisms. The results of the study support the conclusion that the most common source of infecting organisms in surgical infections is thepatient or those around him. The most common time of contamination is during the surgical procedure itself. Surgical infections can best be minimized by meticulous observation of fundamental principles of antisepsis rather than by dependence on elaborate and costly ventilation and air control systems.},

There are instances when drug dose and/or schedule can be used to minimize the probability that mutants will take over the bacterial population. Over the past several years, significant advances have been made in understanding the relationship between drug concentrations and amplification of resistant mutant subpopulations. In this review, we examine the use of preclinical models for facilitating this understanding. We also use mathematical techniques, including Monte Carlo simulation, to bridge between the identification of exposures to minimize resistance and the examination of candidate drug doses to achieve this end. Examples are provided for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In each instance, quinolone antimicrobials were examined.

It is reported that THZ primarily acts on enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and membrane proteins, particularly efflux pumps, as well as oxidoreductases and proteins involved in aerobic respiration that overlap with a number of conventional antituberculous drugs. It targets the products of the Rv3160c-Rv3161c operon, which are perhaps required for the detoxification of THZ, members of the sigma factor SigB regulon that play a crucial role in protecting the pathogen against cell envelope damage, and Rv2745c, a transcription factor that regulates ATP-dependent proteolysis. Some of these genes have been shown to be essential for the survival or persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the infected host. Since THZ targets multiple pathways, including those involved in cell wall processes and respiratory chain components, it may serve as a model for multi-target drug development, as well as constitute a highly potent addition to a combination of antituberculous drug regimens. The discussion of some of the patents relevant to thioridazine to combat tuberculosis is also included in the present manuscript.},

  Abstract                 = {A quantitative structure activity relationship study was performed on different groups of anti-tuberculosis drug compound for establishing quantitative relationship between biological activity and their physicochemical /structural properties. In recent years, a large number of herbal drugs are promoted in treatment of tuberculosis especially due to the emergence of MDR (multi drug resistance) and XDR (extensive drug resistance) tuberculosis. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is resistant to front-line drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin, the most powerful anti-TB drugs) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is resistant to front-line and second-line drugs. The possibility of drug resistance TB increases when patient does not take prescribed drugs for defined time period. Natural products (secondary metabolites) isolated from the variety of sources including terrestrial and marine plants and animals, and microorganisms, have been recognized as having antituberculosis action and have recently been tested preclinically for their growth inhibitory activity towards Mycobacterium tuberculosis or related organisms. A quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies were performed to explore the antituberculosis compound from the derivatives of natural products . Theoretical results are in accord with the in vitro experimental data with reported growth inhibitory activity towards Mycobacterium tuberculosis or related organisms. Antitubercular activity was predicted through QSAR model, developed by forward feed multiple linear regression method with leave-one-out approach. Relationship correlating measure of QSAR model was 74\% (R(2) = 0.74) and predictive accuracy was 72\% (RCV(2) = 0.72). QSAR studies indicate that dipole energy and heat of formation correlate well with anti-tubercular activity. These results could offer useful references for understanding mechanisms and directing the molecular design of new lead compounds with improved anti-tubercular activity. The generated QSAR model revealed the importance of structural, thermodynamic and electro topological parameters. The quantitative structure activity relationship provides important structural insight in designing of potent antitubercular agent.},

Refined behavioural and epidemiological models should be able to investigate the mechanisms by which early diagnosis could be achieved, in addition to the consequent epidemiological effects.},

In monitoring progress in tuberculosis control, the ultimate aim for all countries is to count tuberculosis cases (incidence) accurately through routine surveillance. Disease prevalence surveys are costly and laborious, but give unbiased measures of tuberculosis burden and trends, and are justified in high-burden countries where many cases and deaths are missed by surveillance systems. Most countries in which tuberculosis is highly endemic do not yet have reliable death registration systems. Verbal autopsy, used in cause-of-death surveys, is an alternative, interim method of assessing tuberculosis mortality, but needs further validation. Although several new assays for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have recently been devised, the tuberculin skin test remains the only practical method of measuring infection in populations. However, this test typically has low specificity and is therefore best used comparatively to assess geographical and temporal variation in risk of infection. By 2015, every country should be able to assess progress in tuberculosis control by estimating the time trend in incidence, and the magnitude of reductions in either prevalence or deaths.},

  Abstract                 = {The discovery of high prevalences of antibiotic resistance in some pathogens, in some parts of the world, has provoked fears of a widespread loss of drug efficacy. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate the evolution of resistance to four major anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin) in 47 sites around the world. The model provides a new method of estimating the relative risk of treatment failure for patients carrying drug-resistant strains and the proportion of patients who develop resistance after failing treatment. Using estimates of these two quantities together with other published data, we reconstructed the epidemic spread of isoniazid resistance over the past 50 years. The predicted median prevalence of resistance among new cases today was 7.0\% (range 0.9-64.3\%), close to the 6.3\% (range 0-28.1\%) observed. Predicted and observed prevalences of resistance to isoniazid plus rifampicin (multidrug-resistant or MDR-TB) after 30 years of combined drug use were also similar, 0.9\% (0.1-5.9\%) and 1.0\% (range 0-14.1\%), respectively. With current data, and under prevailing treatment practices, it appears that MDR-TB will remain a localized problem, rather than becoming a global obstacle to tuberculosis control. To substantiate this result, further measurements are needed of the relative fitness of drug-resistant strains.},

  Abstract                 = {To estimate the risk and prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection and tuberculosis (TB) incidence, prevalence, and mortality, including disease attributable to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for 212 countries in 1997.A panel of 86 TB experts and epidemiologists from more than 40 countries was chosen by the World Health Organization (WHO), with final agreement being reached between country experts and WHO staff.Incidence of TB and mortality in each country was determined by (1) case notification to the WHO, (2) annual risk of infection data from tuberculin surveys, and (3) data on prevalence of smear-positive pulmonary disease from prevalence surveys. Estimates derived from relatively poor data were strongly influenced by panel member opinion. Objective estimates were derived from high-quality data collected recently by approved procedures.Agreement was reached by (1) participants reviewing methods and data and making provisional estimates in closed workshops held at WHO's 6 regional offices, (2) principal authors refining estimates using standard methods and all available data, and (3) country experts reviewing and adjusting these estimates and reaching final agreement with WHO staff.In 1997, new cases of TB totaled an estimated 7.96 million (range, 6.3 million-11.1 million), including 3.52 million (2.8 million-4.9 million) cases (44\%) of infectious pulmonary disease (smear-positive), and there were 16.2 million (12.1 million-22.5 million) existing cases of disease. An estimated 1.87 million (1.4 million-2.8 million) people died of TB and the global case fatality rate was 23\% but exceeded 50\% in some African countries with high HIV rates. Global prevalence of MTB infection was 32\% (1.86 billion people). Eighty percent of all incident TB cases were found in 22 countries, with more than half the cases occurring in 5 Southeast Asian countries. Nine of 10 countries with the highest incidence rates per capita were in Africa. Prevalence of MTB/HIV coinfection worldwide was 0.18\% and 640000 incident TB cases (8\%) had HIV infection. The global burden of tuberculosis remains enormous, mainly because of poor control in Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern Europe, and because of high rates of M tuberculosis and HIV coinfection in some African countries.},

  Abstract                 = {To examine the impact of HIV on infectiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).A cross-sectional tuberculin survey carried out among household contacts of HIV-1-positive and negative patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB. Contacts were also examined for active TB.Index cases were recruited from patients attending the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia and household contacts were examined during visits to their homes within Lusaka.A total of 207 contacts of 43 HIV-positive patients, and 141 contacts of 28 HIV-negative patients with pulmonary TB were examined.Proportion of contacts of HIV-positive and negative index cases with a positive tuberculin response (diameter of induration > or = 5 mm to a dose of 2 tuberculin units).Fifty-two per cent of contacts of HIV-positive pulmonary TB patients had a positive tuberculin response compared with 71\% of contacts of HIV-negative patients (odds ratio, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.72; P < 0.001). This difference persisted after allowing for between-household variations in the tuberculin response. Tuberculin response in the contact was related to age of contact, intimacy with the index case and crowding in the household. However, the effect of HIV status of the index case was not confounded by these variables. Tuberculin response in the contact was also related to the number of bacilli seen in the sputum smear of the index case which partially explained the effect of HIV status of the index case. Active TB was diagnosed in 4\% of contacts of HIV-positive and 3\% of contacts of HIV-negative cases, respectively (P = 0.8).HIV-positive patients with pulmonary TB may be less infectious than their HIV-negative counterparts and this may partly be explained by lower bacillary load in the sputum.Between April and December 1989, the chest clinic of the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia, confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in 141 adults, 95 (67\%) of whom were HIV-1 seropositive. Health workers made home visits to 71 of the index cases (43 HIV-1 positive and 28 HIV-1 negative) to learn whether the 348 household members would also develop TB, thus allowing researchers to determine the effect of HIV on infectiousness of TB. Contacts of HIV-1 positive patients developed TB at a lower rate than did those of HIV-1 negative patients (52\% vs. 71\%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.43; p .001). This difference continued even after controlling for between-household variations, indicating that confounding variables did not account for the difference. Age of contact, intimacy with the index case, and crowding in the household were associated with the tuberculin response in the contact, but they did not confound the effect of HIV status. Tuberculin response in the contact was associated with the number of bacilli in the sputum smear (crude OR = 3.13; p = .013, and adjusted OR =1.84; p = .28), suggesting that the number of bacilli somewhat explained the difference in infectiousness between HIV-1 positive and HIV-1 negative patients. 12 contacts (8 of HIV-positive cases and 4 of HIV-negative cases) developed active TB after the TB diagnosis in the index case. These findings clearly demonstrated that infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis was less likely in household members of HIV-1 positive cases than in those of HIV-1 negative cases. The lower bacillary load in the sputum in HIV- 1 cases may have accounted somewhat for the lower infectiousness of pulmonary TB.},

Trimmed versions of meta-analytic estimators for the risk difference, adapted from procedures designed for a random-effects analysis, can resist the impact of a few anomalous studies. A simulation study compared untrimmed and trimmed versions of four meta-analytic procedures that give weighted averages of risk differences. An adaptation of Winsorized estimates of components of variance gains some resistance to anomalous studies when estimating variability. The simulations found that a modified version of the DerSimonian-Laird estimator is attractive when risk differences reveal the added variability described by a random-effects model, and that a 20 per cent trimmed, weighted version of this procedure offers resistance against the impact of highly anomalous results. Among four trimmed procedures considered, the trimmed version of the modified DerSimonian-Laird estimator offers the best performance over a wide range of simulation designs and sample sizes. None of the methods, whether trimmed or untrimmed, is uniformly preferable. A published meta-analysis of a vaccination against TB provides data that serve to illustrate differences among the eight procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {Drug-resistant tuberculosis has been reported since the early days of the introduction of chemotherapy. However, most of the evidence was limited to developed countries. In 1992, the Third World Congress on Tuberculosis concluded that there was little recent information on the global magnitude of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. Through the WHO/IUATLD Global Project on Drug-Resistance Surveillance launched in 1994, a large number of reliable and accurate data have allowed us to understand the magnitude of the problem of MDR-TB. The data available suggest that globally MDR-TB is not a problem (median = 1\% in 64 countries/geographical sites surveyed) of the same magnitude as that of drug-susceptible tuberculosis. However, MDR-TB is at critical levels in specific regions of the world. Hot spots for MDR-TB include Estonia, Latvia, the Oblasts of Ivanovo and Tomsk in Russia, and the provinces of Henan and Zhejiang Provinces in China. Trends confirm that MDR-TB is limited to local epidemics but the evidence is not yet irrefutable, as many countries have only provided short-term data. Two-thirds of the world's countries and, more importantly, half of the 22 tuberculosis high-burden countries, have not yet provided data. Mathematical modelling suggests that 3.2\% (or 273,000) of the world's estimated new tuberculosis cases (95\% confidence intervals: 185,000 and 414,000) were MDR-TB in 2000. Adoption of DOTS to prevent the generation of resistant strains and careful introduction of second-line drugs to treat patients with MDR are the top priorities for proper control/containment of MDR-TB.},

  Abstract                 = {Paediatric multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis is a public health challenge of growing concern, accounting for an estimated 15\% of all global cases of MDR tuberculosis. Clinical management is especially challenging, and recommendations are based on restricted evidence. We aimed to assess existing evidence for the treatment of MDR tuberculosis in children.We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies reporting treatment outcomes for children with MDR tuberculosis. We searched PubMed, Ovid, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO, and BioMedCentral databases up to Oct 31, 2011. Eligible studies included five or more children (aged ≤16 years) with MDR tuberculosis within a defined treatment cohort. The primary outcome was treatment success, defined as a composite of cure and treatment completion.We identified eight studies, which reported treatment outcomes for a total of 315 patients. We recorded much variation in the characteristics of patients and programmes. Time to appropriate treatment varied from 2 days to 46 months. Average duration of treatment ranged from 6 months to 34 months, and duration of follow-up ranged from 12 months to 37 months. The pooled estimate for treatment success was 81·67\% (95\% CI 72·54-90·80). Across all studies, 5·9\% (95\% CI 1·3-10·5) died, 6·2\% (2·3-10·2) defaulted, and 39·1\% (28·7-49·4) had an adverse event. The most common drug-related adverse events were nausea and vomiting. Other serious adverse events were hearing loss, psychiatric effects, and hypothyroidism.The treatment of paediatric MDR tuberculosis has been neglected, but when children are treated outcomes can be achieved that are at least as good as those reported for adults. Programmes should be encouraged to report outcomes in children to improve the knowledge base for care, especially as new drugs become available.None.},

This study aims to construct a mathematical model to simulate reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in persons who combine the use of statins with a high intake of phytosterols/-stanols, e.g. by the use of functional foods.The proposed model includes the cholesterol pool size in the liver and serum levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. Both an additional and a multiplicative effect of phytosterol/-stanol intake on LDL cholesterol reduction were predicted from the model. The additional effect relates to the decrease of dietary cholesterol uptake reduction, the multiplicative effect relates to the decrease in enterohepatic recycling efficiency, causing increased cholesterol elimination through bile. From the model, it was demonstrated that a daily intake of 2 g phytosterols/-stanols reduces LDL cholesterol level by about 8\% to 9\% on top of the reduction resulting from statin use. The additional decrease in LDL cholesterol caused by phytosterol/-stanol use at the recommended level of 2 g/d appeared to be similar or even greater than the decrease achieved by doubling the statin dose.We proposed a simplified mathematical model to simulate the reduction in LDL cholesterol after separate and combined intake of statins and functional foods acting on intestinal (re)absorption of cholesterol or bile acids in humans. In future work, this model can be extended to include more complex (regulatory) mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death globally. TB had been considered conquered in Europe but has re-emerged as a significant problem, partly because of poor TB control programs and the link with HIV infection, migrants and other vulnerable populations, but also because a mood of complacency led to declining investment in research and public health infrastructure. In the European Union (EU), efforts initiated by the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC) now assess how research can better inform policy development and indicate the gaps and uncertainties in the scientific evidence base. A growing number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains are now resistant to the first-line anti-TB drugs, necessitating use of second-line drugs which are more expensive, less effective and more toxic. The presence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB in the EU illustrates that there are problems with TB management and control. In the EU, the aggregated rate of notified TB is approximately 18 cases per 100,000 population (range 4-120 cases/100,000 in different Member States). The highest rates are found in Eastern European countries. Only about half of EU countries routinely perform drug susceptibility testing linked to notification of TB cases. It is important for the European Commission (EC) to network regional reference laboratories to support molecular epidemiology and exchange of data via creation of interactive international databases of Mtb genotypic and phenotypic information. EU countries should help develop TB laboratory services by investing in training and provision of assistance to maintain quality control in neighbouring Eastern European countries. Improved TB care necessitates research across the spectrum to include fundamental and epidemiological science, research and development (R&D) for new drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, and operational research. Total R&D investment in TB by the EC and Member States is low by comparison with the USA despite Europe being on the frontline of the epidemic. Thus, alternative funding models for targeting TB research priorities by the EU are required. Increasing the visibility of TB as a priority issue for the EU requires the scientific community, with the academies of science, as appropriate, to communicate to politicians, healthcare providers, funders and the public at large about the current threat posed by drug-resistant TB. Any global strategy for TB control must also take into account measures to address the social, environmental and economic issues which are inextricably linked with TB. The academies conclude that, overall, the EU has failed so far to respond sufficiently to the global TB threat but can still draw on considerable strengths in its science. The EU also has a humanitarian responsibility to support TB control in developing countries. It remains very important for the EC that neither biomedical research nor investment in health services should become a casualty of the current economic recession.},

An increase in fluorescence of macrophages incubated with varying concentrations of fluorescein isothiocyanate or Tb-DOTA-tuftsin/pentapeptide conjugates was observed in a concentration-dependent manner. Tb-DOTA-pentapeptide had a greater affinity to macrophages than Tb-DOTA-tuftsin. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation strengthened the internalization of peptide conjugates by macrophages through the tuftsin receptor mechanism. Tb-DOTA-tuftsin/pentapeptide conjugates are likely to be a promising optical reagents as probes of the immune response with involvement of macrophage cells in a variety of diseases. Gd-DOTA-tuftsin conjugate was also evaluated as a cell-specific contrast agent in in vitro MRI experiments. In this context, the macrophages labelled by Gd-DOTA-tuftsin were highly magnetic and detectable by MRI, which confirms that this vectorized MRI probe has the potential to image macrophage-mediated inflammation in diseases like brain traumas and stroke. Tuftsin receptor-specific biological-function domain may have a modified in vivo biodistribution profile, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics subsequent to its conjugation to a metal ion-binding backbone.},

  Abstract                 = {Regional differences in vaccination uptake are common in both developed and developing countries, and are often linked to the availability of healthcare services and socioeconomic factors. In 2007, 0.9 million eligible Indonesian children missed measles vaccination, and 19 456 cases of measles were documented among Indonesian children. The authors investigated rural-urban differentials in measles vaccination coverage among young Indonesian children, and sought to identify key factors influencing the probability of a child receiving the first dose of measles vaccination in Indonesia.Data used in the analyses were sourced from the nationally representative Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey 2007. The influence of location of residence, household wealth, maternal and paternal education, total children ever born and use of skilled birth attendants on measles vaccination coverage was investigated using bivariate analysis and chi-square tests. The independent effects of these variables were established using binomial logistic regression analysis.Indonesia's 2007 first-dose measles national vaccination coverage was, at 72.8\%, lower than the 2008 global first-dose measles vaccination average coverage of 82\%. Bivariate analysis revealed that the first-dose measles vaccination coverage in rural areas of Indonesia was 68.5\%, compared with 80.1\% in urban regions (p < 0.001). The apparent significance of rural residence in impairing vaccination coverage was marginal after controlling for the sex of the child, maternal age, maternal and paternal education, wealth, and access to skilled health workers.Apart from sustainable initiatives to increase measles vaccination coverage globally, it is important to close the rural-urban gap in Indonesia's measles vaccination uptake. Addressing critical determinants of inferior measles vaccination coverage in Indonesia's rural regions will facilitate major improvements in Indonesia's child health trends. This article suggests initiatives for addressing three of such determinants in Indonesia's rural areas: poverty, parental education and access to skilled health workers.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global emergency and continues to kill 1.4 million people every year. The interaction between noncommunicable and infectious diseases like TB has important implications with regard to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Smoking, diabetes mellitus, anti-TNFα drugs and other immunosuppressive therapies are well known major risk factors associated with TB. The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent literature on these risk factors and interventions that reduce the risk.Mathematical models and aggregate data from the field show that smoking, diabetes and anti-TNFα drugs independently increase the risk of developing active TB. There is consensus on the great need for screening for active TB disease in patients with these conditions and targeted preventive interventions through a combined multidisciplinary approach.Smoking, diabetes mellitus, anti-TNFα drugs and new immunosuppressive treatments represent important common risk factors for TB. A high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of TB should be considered in patients with these risk factors, and active screening and prevention should be undertaken. Further operational research is needed to optimize screening for latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, instituting preventive intervention measures.},

  Abstract                 = {To investigate the microstructural differences and responsible mechanisms in early bone formation in anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) in the spine using rhBMP-2 (INFUSE), equine bone protein extract (COLLOSS E) or autograft.Twelve Danish female landrace pigs underwent a 3-level ALIF procedure at L3-6. PEEK interbody cages packed with rhBMP-2, COLLOSS E, or autograft were inserted. The animals were divided into two groups of six, and observed for four and eight weeks postoperatively. MicroCT was performed for evaluation of microstructure of the bone within the cage. A mathematical finite element model was developed to investigate the aqueous behavior within the cages when exposed to external compressive forces.At 4 weeks postoperative bone surface volume fraction (BS/TV) using rhBMP-2 was higher than with use of COLLOSS E and autograft, while trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) was lower using rhBMP-2 at this time-point. At eight weeks BS/TV and trabecular number (Tb.N.) were still higher using rhBMP-2 than autograft and COLLOSS E. Connectivity density was significantly higher using rhBMP-2 than using autograft or COLLOSS E at both time-points. Between four- and eight-week time-points BV/TV and Tb.Th. rose while Tb.N. declined using rhBMP-2. The degree of anisotropy and the calculated amount of trabeculae with main direction along the spinal axis, were higher at four weeks using COLLOSS E. rhBMP-2 had the highest amount of trabeculae directed along the spinal axis at eight weeks. A change in main direction between four and eight weeks was observed for both autograft and rhBMP-2. The numerical results from the finite element model verify that significantly different flow pattern emerges as the boundary conditions are altered. At four weeks there was an evident correlation between trabecular orientation and flow pattern using rhBMP-2.This study reveals large differences in microstructure in the early osteogenesis and explains important mechanisms of early bone formation using rhBMP-2, COLLOSS E or autograft treatment. These differences might explain some of the unfortunate events reported such as edema, swelling, and excessive bone formation using different bone graft substitutes in spinal fusion procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {A key question in tuberculosis control is why some strains of M. tuberculosis are preferentially associated with resistance to multiple drugs. We demonstrate that M. tuberculosis strains from lineage 2 (East Asian lineage and Beijing sublineage) acquire drug resistances in vitro more rapidly than M. tuberculosis strains from lineage 4 (Euro-American lineage) and that this higher rate can be attributed to a higher mutation rate. Moreover, the in vitro mutation rate correlates well with the bacterial mutation rate in humans as determined by whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates. Finally, using a stochastic mathematical model, we demonstrate that the observed differences in mutation rate predict a substantially higher probability that patients infected with a drug-susceptible lineage 2 strain will harbor multidrug-resistant bacteria at the time of diagnosis. These data suggest that interventions to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis should target bacterial as well as treatment-related risk factors.},

Mathematical models predict that strain fitness is an important determinant of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission, but the effects of strain diversity have been largely overlooked. Here we compared the impact of resistance mutations on the transmission of isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis in San Francisco during a 9-y period. Strains with a KatG S315T or inhA promoter mutation were more likely to spread than strains with other mutations. The impact of these mutations on the transmission of isoniazid-resistant strains was comparable to the effect of other clinical determinants of transmission. Associations were apparent between specific drug resistance mutations and the main M. tuberculosis lineages. Our results show that in addition to host and environmental factors, strain genetic diversity can influence the transmission dynamics of drug-resistant bacteria.},

  Abstract                 = {Although progress has been made to reduce global incidence of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis during the past decade threatens to undermine these advances. However, countries are responding far too slowly. Of the estimated 440,000 cases of MDR tuberculosis that occurred in 2008, only 7\% were identified and reported to WHO. Of these cases, only a fifth were treated according to WHO standards. Although treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis is possible with currently available diagnostic techniques and drugs, the treatment course is substantially more costly and laborious than for drug-susceptible tuberculosis, with higher rates of treatment failure and mortality. Nonetheless, a few countries provide examples of how existing technologies can be used to reverse the epidemic of MDR tuberculosis within a decade. Major improvements in laboratory capacity, infection control, performance of tuberculosis control programmes, and treatment regimens for both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant disease will be needed, together with a massive scale-up in diagnosis and treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis to prevent drug-resistant strains from becoming the dominant form of tuberculosis. New diagnostic tests and drugs are likely to become available during the next few years and should accelerate control of MDR and XDR tuberculosis. Equally important, especially in the highest-burden countries of India, China, and Russia, will be a commitment to tuberculosis control including improvements in national policies and health systems that remove financial barriers to treatment, encourage rational drug use, and create the infrastructure necessary to manage MDR tuberculosis on a national scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Novel treatments for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), or latent TB are needed urgently. Recently, we reported the formulation and characterization of the nitroimidazo-oxazine PA-824 for efficient aerosol delivery as dry powder porous particles and the subsequent disposition in guinea pigs after pulmonary administration. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of these PA-824 therapeutic aerosols on the extent of TB infection in the low-inoculum aerosol infection guinea pig model. Four weeks after infection by the pulmonary route, animals received daily treatment for 4 weeks of either a high or a low dose of PA-824 dry powder aerosol. Animals received PA-824 cyclodextrin/lecithin suspensions orally as positive controls, and those receiving placebo particles or no treatment were negative controls. The lungs and spleens of animals receiving the high dose of inhaled PA-824 particles exhibited a lower degree of inflammation (indicated by wet tissue weights), bacterial burden, and tissue damage (indicated by histopathology) than those of untreated or placebo animals. Treatment with oral PA-824 cyclodextrin/lecithin suspension resulted in a more significant reduction in the bacterial burden of lungs and spleen, consistent with a dose that was larger than inhaled doses (eight times the inhaled low dose and four times the inhaled high dose). However, histopathological analysis revealed that the extent of tissue damage was comparable in groups receiving the oral or either inhaled dose. The present studies indicate the potential use of PA-824 dry powder aerosols in the treatment of TB.},

TAD is widely used in operating theaters as a surgical guideline in relation to the fixation of trochanteric fractures, and in clinical studies as a predictor of lag screw cut-out. In order to visualize better this concept, the locus of points having the same TAD was plotted and the dependence of TAD on the location of the lag screw tip was also reported. It was shown that TAD should be adjusted for the size of the femoral head (a variable which varies a lot according to the sex of the patient) while no correlation was found between TAD and bone morphometry indices obtained from micro-CT data (BV/TV and Tb.Th). Therefore, these results seem to suggest that TAD lacks mechanical justification and that predictors which are based on mechanical properties, such as bone density, should be investigated further.},

  Abstract                 = {Peripheral blood flow can be regulated by specialized vessel segments, the arteriovenous anastomoses. Their wall consists of a relatively thick layer of smooth muscle cells and so-called epithelioid cells. The epithelioid cell is a specialized myogenic cell phenotype expressing nitric oxide synthase. We studied the innervation of the different segments of arteriovenous anastomoses in the rabbit ear using antisera against neuropeptide Y, tyrosine hydroxylase, calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, as well as neuron-specific enolase, calbindin D and neurotubulin. The participation was especially examined of neuropeptidergic innervation and a possible morphological connection to the occurrence of epithelioid cells and a paracrine function. The NADPH diaphorase reaction and alpha-smooth muscle actin immunoelectron microscopy served to distinguish epithelioid cells from smooth muscle cells. Using conventional fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found the most dense innervation pattern of pan-neuronal markers (neurotubulin, neuron-specific enolase), tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive nerve fibres and neuropeptidergic nerve fibres (neuropeptide Y, calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P) around the intermediate segment in arteriovenous anastomoses, whereas the venous segment was barely marked. Single nerve fibres penetrated into the medial layer and reached the epithelioid cells. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we found intercellular contacts between epithelioid cells, but not the gap junction protein connexin 43. Here, we report for the first time a correlation of the innervation pattern with epithelioid cell type in arteriovenous anastomoses. Our findings suggest that epithelioid cells of the arteriovenous anastomoses are controlled by a dense network of neuropeptidergic nerve fibres in functional connection to their paracrine role as a nitric oxide producer.},

  Abstract                 = {Detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), a frequent cause of treatment failure, takes 2 or more weeks to identify by culture. Rifampicin (RIF) resistance is a hallmark of MDR-TB, and detection of mutations in the rpoB gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using molecular beacon probes with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a novel approach that takes </=2 days. However, qPCR identification of resistant isolates, particularly for isolates with mixed RIF-susceptible and RIF-resistant bacteria, is reader dependent and limits its clinical use. The aim of this study was to develop an objective, reader-independent method to define rpoB mutants using beacon qPCR. This would facilitate the transition from a research protocol to the clinical setting, where high-throughput methods with objective interpretation are required. For this, DNAs from 107 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates with known susceptibility to RIF by culture-based methods were obtained from 2 regions where isolates have not previously been subjected to evaluation using molecular beacon qPCR: the Texas-Mexico border and Colombia. Using coded DNA specimens, mutations within an 81-bp hot spot region of rpoB were established by qPCR with 5 beacons spanning this region. Visual and mathematical approaches were used to establish whether the qPCR cycle threshold of the experimental isolate was significantly higher (mutant) compared to a reference wild-type isolate. Visual classification of the beacon qPCR required reader training for strains with a mixture of RIF-susceptible and RIF-resistant bacteria. Only then had the visual interpretation by an experienced reader had 100\% sensitivity and 94.6\% specificity versus RIF resistance by culture phenotype and 98.1\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity versus mutations based on DNA sequence. The mathematical approach was 98\% sensitive and 94.5\% specific versus culture and 96.2\% sensitive and 100\% specific versus DNA sequence. Our findings indicate the mathematical approach has advantages over the visual reading, in that it uses a Microsoft Excel template to eliminate reader bias or inexperience, and allows objective interpretation from high-throughput analyses even in the presence of a mixture of RIF-resistant and RIF-susceptible isolates without the need for reader training.},

The effectiveness of screening depends on several factors, including pathogen natural history and epidemiology, human behavior, and characteristics of the source epidemic. We developed a mathematical model to understand how these factors combine to influence screening outcomes. We analyzed screening programs for six emerging pathogens in the early and late stages of an epidemic. We show that the effectiveness of different screening tools depends strongly on pathogen natural history and epidemiological features, as well as human factors in implementation and compliance. For pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage. However, even in the most optimistic scenario arrival screening will miss the majority of cases.},

  Abstract                 = {For millennia, humans have sought and found purpose, solace, values, understanding, and fellowship in religious practices. Buddhist nuns performed variolation against smallpox over 1000 years ago. Since Jenner developed vaccination against smallpox in 1796, some people have objected to and declined vaccination, citing various religious reasons. This paper reviews the scriptural, canonical basis for such interpretations, as well as passages that support immunization. Populous faith traditions are considered, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Subjects of concern such as blood components, pharmaceutical excipients of porcine or bovine origin, rubella strain RA 27/3, and cell-culture media with remote fetal origins are evaluated against the religious concerns identified. The review identified more than 60 reports or evaluations of vaccine-preventable infectious-disease outbreaks that occurred within religious communities or that spread from them to broader communities. In multiple cases, ostensibly religious reasons to decline immunization actually reflected concerns about vaccine safety or personal beliefs among a social network of people organized around a faith community, rather than theologically based objections per se. Themes favoring vaccine acceptance included transformation of vaccine excipients from their starting material, extensive dilution of components of concern, the medicinal purpose of immunization (in contrast to diet), and lack of alternatives. Other important features included imperatives to preserve health and duty to community (e.g., parent to child, among neighbors). Concern that 'the body is a temple not to be defiled' is contrasted with other teaching and quality-control requirements in manufacturing vaccines and immune globulins. Health professionals who counsel hesitant patients or parents can ask about the basis for concern and how the individual applies religious understanding to decision-making about medical products, explain facts about content and processes, and suggest further dialog with informed religious leaders. Key considerations for observant believers for each populous religion are described.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis (TB) remains a deadly infectious disease affecting millions of people worldwide; 95\% of TB cases, with 98\% of death occur in developing countries. The situation in South Africa merits special attention. A total of 21,913 sputum specimens of suspected TB patients from three provinces of South Africa routinely submitted to the TB laboratory of Dr. George Mukhari (DGM) Hospital were assayed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) growth and antibiotic susceptibility. The genetic diversity of 338 resistant strains were also studied. DNA isolated from the strains were restricted with Pvu II, transferred on to a nylon membrane and hybridized with a PCR-amplified horseradish peroxidase 245 bp IS6110 probe. Of the 338 resistant strains, 2.09\% had less than 5 bands of IS6110, and 98\% had 5 or more bands. Unique restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns were observed in 84.3\% of the strains, showing their epidemiological independence, and 15.7\% were grouped into 22 clusters. Thirty-two strains (61.5\%) from the 52 that clustered were from Mpumalanga, 16/52 (30.8\%) from Gauteng, and 4/52 (9.6\%) from Limpopo province. Clustering was not associated with age. However, strains from male patients in Mpumalanga were more likely to be clustered than strains from male patients in Limpopo and/or Gauteng province. The minimum estimate for the proportion of resistant TB that was due to transmission is 9.06\% (52-22 = 30/331). Our results indicate that transmission of drug-resistant strains may contribute substantially to the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa.},

In this context, a recent paper [Misbah, Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 028104 (2006)] revealed a dynamic referred to as the vacillating-breathing (VB) mode where the vesicle main axis oscillates about the flow direction and the shape undergoes a breathinglike motion, as well as the tank-treading and tumbling (TB) regimes. Our goal here is to identify these three modes by obtaining explicit analytical expressions of the vesicle inclination angle and the shape deformation. In particular, the VB regime is put in evidence and the transition dynamics is discussed. Not surprisingly, our finding confirms the Keller-Skalak solutions (for rigid particles) and shows that the VB and TB modes coexist, and whether one prevails over the other depends on the initial conditions. An interesting additional element in the discussion is the prediction of the TB and VB modes as functions of a control parameter Γ, which can be identified as a TB-VB parameter.},

For multiple exhalations, the droplet concentration in a zone can be obtained by adding the droplet concentrations for all the exhalations until the current time with a time shift via the superposition method. These methods were used to determine the amount of droplets inhaled by the susceptible passengers over a 4-h flight under three common scenarios. The method, if coupled with information on the viability and the amount of infectious agent in the droplet, can aid in evaluating the infection risk.The distribution of the infectious agents contained in the expiratory droplets of an infected occupant in an indoor environment is transient and non-uniform. The risk of infection can thus vary with time and space. The investigations developed methods to predict the spatial and temporal distribution of expiratory droplets, and the inhalation of these droplets in an aircraft cabin. The methods can be used in other indoor environments to assess the relative risk of infection in different zones, and suitable measures to control the spread of infection can be adopted. Appropriate treatment can be implemented for the zone identified as high-risk zones.},

  Abstract                 = {The droplets exhaled by an index patient with infectious disease such as influenza or tuberculosis may be the carriers of contagious agents. Indoor environments such as the airliner cabins may be susceptible to infection from such airborne contagious agents. The present investigation computed the transport of the droplets exhaled by the index patient seated in the middle of a seven-row, twin-aisle, fully occupied cabin using the CFD simulations. The droplets exhaled were from a single cough, a single breath, and a 15-s talk of the index patient. The expiratory droplets were tracked by using Lagrangian method, and their evaporation was modeled. It was found that the bulk airflow pattern in the cabin played the most important role on the droplet transport. The droplets were contained in the row before, at, and after the index patient within 30 s and dispersed uniformly to all the seven rows in 4 minutes. The total airborne droplet fraction reduced to 48, 32, 20, and 12\% after they entered the cabin for 1, 2, 3, and 4 min, respectively, because of the ventilation from the environmental control system.It is critical to predict the risk of airborne infection to take appropriate measures to control and mitigate the risk. Most of the studies in past either assume a homogenous distribution of contaminants or use steady-state conditions. The present study instead provides information on the transient movement of the droplets exhaled by an index passenger in an aircraft cabin. These droplets may contain active contagious agents and can be potent enough to cause infection. The findings can be used by medical professionals to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of risk of infection to various passengers in the cabin.},

The aim of this study was to investigate anti-tuberculosis potential of the plants using Mycobacterium smegmatis as a rapid screening model for detection of anti-mycobacterial activity and further to evaluate the active plants for anti-tuberculosis activity against M. tuberculosis using radiometric BACTEC assay.The 15 plants were screened for anti-mycobacterial activity against M. smegmatis by the disk diffusion assay. The ethanolic extracts of Mallotus philippensis, Vitex negundo, Colebrookea oppositifolia, Rumex hastatus, Mimosa pudica, Kalanchoe integra and Flacourtia ramontchii were active against M. smegmatis in primary screening. The anti-tuberculosis potential was identified in the leaves extracts of Mallotus philippensis by radiometric BACTEC assay. The ethanolic extract of M. philippensis showed anti-tuberculosis activity against virulent and avirulent strains of M. tuberculosis H(37) Rv and M. tuberculosis H(37) Ra with minimum inhibitory concentration 0·25 and 0·125 mg ml(-1), respectively. The inhibition in growth index values of M. tuberculosis was observed in the presence of ethyl acetate fraction at a minimum concentration of 0·05 mg ml(-1).We found that BACTEC radiometric assay is a valuable method for detection of anti-tuberculosis activity of the plant extracts. The results indicate that ethanolic extract and ethyl acetate fraction of M. philippensis exhibited significant anti-mycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis.These findings provide scientific evidence to support the traditional medicinal uses of M. philippensis and indicate a promising potential of this plant for the development of anti-tuberculosis agent.},

  Abstract                 = {Finding more effective vaccines against tuberculosis (TB) and improved preventive treatments against endogenous reactivation of latent TB is strategic to block transmission and reach the WHO goal of eliminating TB by 2050. Key related open questions in TB research include: i) what are the determinants of a strong memory response upon primary infection? ii) what is the role of cytokines towards protective memory response against a secondary infection? iii) what are the mechanisms responsible for the increased risk of reactivation in elderly individuals? To address these questions, we explored a computational model of the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis including a mathematical description of immunosenescence and the generation and maintenance of immune memory. Sensitivity analysis techniques, together with extensive model characterization and in silico experiments, were applied to identify key mechanisms controlling TB reactivation and immunological memory. Key findings of this study are summarized by the following model predictions: i) increased strength and duration of memory protection is associated with higher levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-[Formula: see text] (TNF) during primary infection; ii) production of TNF, but not of interferon-[Formula: see text], by memory T cells during secondary infection is a major determinant of effective protection; iii) impaired recruitment of CD4+ T cells may promote reactivation of latent TB infections in aging hosts. This study is a first attempt to consider the immune dynamics of a persistent infection throughout the lifetime of the host, taking into account immunosenescence and memory. While the model is TB specific, the results are applicable to other persistent bacterial infections and can aid in the development, evaluation and refinement of TB treatment and/or vaccine protocols.},

Abuse history and prospective condom use data were collected from 214 HIV infected and 189 uninfected women participating in the HIV Epidemiology Research Study (HERS) who were inconsistent condom users at baseline and received two safer sex counseling sessions. Analyses were conducted to assess the association between abuse history and condom use while controlling for sociodemographic variables and other risk factors. HIV-uninfected women with a history of adult physical abuse were five times less likely to report consistent condom use at 1-year follow-up than uninfected women without a history of abuse while holding control variables constant. Expectations of a negative reaction by the partner to suggested condom use did not explain this association. Though in the same direction as in uninfected women, abuse history was not significantly related to consistent condom use among HIV-infected women. These data indicate the need to develop risk prevention strategies tailored to uninfected women with a history of adult abuse. In lieu of specialized interventions, health care providers should assess women's abuse history and supplement HIV prevention counseling with mental health counseling when indicated.},

The global TB emergency has been further exacerbated by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB strains that are resistant to our best antibiotics and very difficult to treat. This review also focuses on the emergence of XDR-TB strains, the global health impact, and existing treatment options and outcomes for XDR-TB disease.

  abstract    = {Uganda has one of the highest total fertility rates (TFR) worldwide. We compared the effects of antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) to that of existing family planning (FP) use and estimated the burden of pediatric HIV disease due to unwanted fertility.Using the demographic software Spectrum, a baseline mathematical projection to estimate the current pediatric HIV burden in Uganda was compared to three hypothetical projections: 1) without ARV-PMTCT (to estimate the effect of ARV-PMTCT), 2) without contraception (effect of existing FP use), 3) without unwanted fertility (effect of unmet FP needs). Key input parameters included HIV prevalence, ARV-PMTCT uptake, MTCT probabilities, and TFR. We estimate that in 2007, an estimated 25,000 vertical infections and 17,000 pediatric AIDS deaths occurred (baseline projection). Existing ARV-PMTCT likely averted 8.1\% of infections and 8.5\% of deaths. FP use likely averted 19.7\% of infections and 13.1\% of deaths. Unwanted fertility accounted for 21.3\% of infections and 13.4\% of deaths. During 2008-2012, an estimated 131,000 vertical infections and 71,000 pediatric AIDS deaths will occur. The projected scale up of ARV-PMTCT (from 39\%-57\%) may avert 18.1\% of infections and 24.5\% of deaths. Projected FP use may avert 21.6\% of infections and 18.5\% of deaths. Unwanted fertility will account for 24.5\% of infections and 19.8\% of deaths.Existing FP use contributes as much or more than ARV-PMTCT in mitigating pediatric HIV in Uganda. Expanding FP services can substantially contribute towards PMTCT.},

  Abstract                 = {Nosocomial clustering with transmission to health care workers, patients and visitors is a prominent feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Hospital outbreaks of SARS typically occurred within the first week after admission of the very first SARS cases when the disease was not recognized and before isolation measures were implemented. In the majority of nosocomial infections, there was a history of close contact with a SARS patient, and transmission occurred via large droplets, direct contact with infectious material or by contact with fomites contaminated by infectious material. In a few instances, potential airborne transmission was reported in association with endotracheal intubation, nebulised medications and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation of SARS patients. In all SARS-affected countries, nosocomial transmission of the disease was effectively halted by enforcement of routine standard, contact and droplet precautions in all clinical areas and additional airborne precautions in the high-risk areas. In Hong Kong, where there are few private rooms for patient isolation, some hospitals have obtained good outcome by having designated SARS teams and separate wards for patient triage, confirmed SARS cases and step-down of patients in whom SARS had been ruled out. In conclusion, SARS represents one of the new challenges for those who are involved in hospital infection control. As SARS might re-emerge, all hospitals should take advantage of the current SARS-free interval to review their infection control programmes, alert mechanisms, response capability and to repair any identified inadequacies.},

The association between TB and transport occupation and MDR-TB and transport occupation is high (respectively OR 3.06, 95\%CI 2.2-4.2 and OR 3.14, 95\%CI 1.1-9.1).These results indicate that the use of informal public transport is a risk factor for TB infection and an occupational risk in countries with characteristics similar to those in Peru.},

Treatment with N-bromosuccinimide quenches enzyme tryptophan and Tb(III) fluorescence to a similar extent and suggests the operation of tryptophan vector Tb(III) vector Co(II) energy relay system in the enzyme. Dipoledipole radiationless energy transfer between the Tb(III) donor and the Co(II) acceptor can account for this quenching. The inherent characteristics of the metal pair limits the value of the orientation factor, K2, of the Förster equation, thereby reducing uncertainties in distance measurements by energy transfer compared with other systems. A quantum yield of 0.51 yields a value of R0, the distance for 50\% energy transfer, of 19.6 A, and a distance, R, between Tb(III) and Co(II) of 13.7 A, a value identical to that measured for the distance between the active site zinc atom and calcium atom number 1 by x-ray analysis in native thermolysin crystals. The limits of confidence of this measurement are discussed. Energy transfer between two different metal atom sites of a protein provides a new class of probes to measure intramolecular distances of biological macromolecules in solution.},

Patients with dyspnea, tachypnea, evidence of hypoxemia, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph should be hospitalized. Patients with severe illness or underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of more severe disease should be treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir as soon as possible, without waiting for the results of laboratory tests. Lung-protective ventilation strategy with a low tidal volume and adequate pressure, in addition to a conservative fluid management approach, is recommended when treating adult patients with ARDS. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has emerged as an important rescue therapy for critically ill patients. Use of systemic steroids was associated with delayed viral clearance in severe acute respiratory syndrome and H3N2 infection. Low-dose corticosteroids may be considered in the treatment of refractory septic shock. Passive immunotherapy in the form of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin may be explored as rescue therapy. More data are needed to explore the potential role of IV gamma globulin and other drugs with immunomodulating properties, such as statins, gemfibrozil, and N-acetyl-cysteine. Health-care workers must apply strict standard and droplet precautions when dealing with suspected and confirmed case and upgrade to airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Nonpharmacologic measures, such as early case isolation, household quarantine, school/workplace closure, good community hygiene, and restrictions on travel are useful measures in controlling an influenza pandemic at its early phase.},

  Abstract                 = {The spread of infectious disease via commercial airliner travel is a significant and realistic threat. To shed some light on the feasibility of detecting airborne pathogens, a sensor integration study has been conducted and computational investigations of contaminant transport in an aircraft cabin have been performed. Our study took into consideration sensor sensitivity as well as the time-to-answer, size, weight and the power of best available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. We conducted computational fluid dynamics simulations to investigate three types of scenarios: (1) nominal breathing (up to 20 breaths per minute) and coughing (20 times per hour); (2) nominal breathing and sneezing (4 times per hour); and (3) nominal breathing only. Each scenario was implemented with one or seven infectious passengers expelling air and sneezes or coughs at the stated frequencies. Scenario 2 was implemented with two additional cases in which one infectious passenger expelled 20 and 50 sneezes per hour, respectively. All computations were based on 90 minutes of sampling using specifications from a COTS aerosol collector and biosensor. Only biosensors that could provide an answer in under 20 minutes without any manual preparation steps were included. The principal finding was that the steady-state bacteria concentrations in aircraft would be high enough to be detected in the case where seven infectious passengers are exhaling under scenarios 1 and 2 and where one infectious passenger is actively exhaling in scenario 2. Breathing alone failed to generate sufficient bacterial particles for detection, and none of the scenarios generated sufficient viral particles for detection to be feasible. These results suggest that more sensitive sensors than the COTS devices currently available and/or sampling of individual passengers would be needed for the detection of bacteria and viruses in aircraft.},

The growing incidence among the elderly and group infections among young adults may be responsible for this increase. Infection with tubercle bacilli(TB) occurs via airborne transmission, which involves dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei on evaporated droplets that may remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be dispersed widely by air currents, therefore, special air handling and ventilation are required to prevent airborne transmission. Patients with infectious TB must be placed in a single room with negative pressure and a ventilation rate of 6 or more air changes per hour. Health care workers must wear an N95 mask when entering the room, and if an incident involving possible TB infection occurs in the hospital, the concerned people should be examined for Tuberculin reaction. Two to 12 weeks after the TB infection has occurred, the tuberculin reaction converts to positive. However, most Japanese people have been vaccinated with BCG, so assessment of the results is difficult. A comparison of the diameter of erythema before and after the potential infection may be the most confirmatory. If latent TB infection is suspected, preventive therapy with isoniazid must be considered. Special biohazard systems in the clinical laboratory and autopsy room have also been proposed to prevent TB dispersal. DOTS(Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course) is useful to prevent the emergence of multi-drug-resistant TB. In some areas of Japan that have low levels of compliance with TB therapy, trials of DOTS have been started.},

Hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin reduce the risk of the baby becoming a carrier, but with only a short window period after birth to deliver this potentially life-saving intervention. We reviewed the evidence on the magnitude of the risk. If the carrier mother is e antigen positive (highly infective), the calculated risk to the infant without intervention is 75.2\%, reduced to 6.0\% by giving vaccine and immunoglobulin at birth. If the mother is surface antigen positive but e antigen negative, the risk to the infant without intervention is 10.3\%, reduced to 1.0\% by giving vaccine and immunoglobulin. If vaccine is accepted but immunoglobulin refused, as for example by some Jehovah's Witnesses, the risk to babies of e antigen positive mothers is reduced to 21.0\% and to babies of e antigen negative mothers to 2.6\%. These figures can be used to inform parents and as a possible basis for child protection proceedings if parents decline vaccine and/or immunoglobulin. We argue from the perspective of the best interests of the child that the severity of the condition justifies initiating child protection proceedings whenever a baby is born to a hepatitis B carrier mother and, despite concerted attempts to persuade them, the parents refuse vaccine and/or immunoglobulin.},

  Abstract                 = {Routine childhood immunizations are compulsory in a small number of countries, including the United States of America. Arguments used to justify making immunizations compulsory include enhancing the health of the community and treating as paramount the rights of the child to be protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. But compulsory immunization infringes the autonomy of parents to make choices about child rearing, an autonomy which we generally respect unless doing so seriously endangers the child's health. We present a historical review and ethics discussion on whether routine childhood immunizations should be compulsory. We conclude that, for both ethical and practical reasons, routine immunization should not be compulsory if adequate levels of immunization can be achieved by other means.},

  Abstract                 = {Discussions about current and future immunisation programmes raise novel questions about familiar ethical issues. Two sets of ethical issues dominate these discussions. The first is the issue of compulsory immunisation: what should be done about parents who fail to immunise their children? The second is: given competing demands on health care budgets, how should principles of justice in access and distribution inform vaccination programmes? This paper considers these two issues in the light of traditional ethical principles. With respect to the first, we argue that compulsion is justified only in cases in which we know with practical certainty that parental failure to immunise puts their own child or other children at high risk of severe illness. We also argue that the state should compensate those who suffer vaccine-related injury. With respect to the second, we claim that allocating resources according to health care need requires establishing priorities between public health programmes such as immunisation and other treatment programmes.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial autocorrelation is problematic for classical hierarchical cluster detection tests commonly used in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) analyses as considerable random error can occur. Therefore, when MDRTB clusters are spatially autocorrelated the assumption that the clusters are independently random is invalid. In this research, a product moment correlation coefficient (i.e., the Moran's coefficient) was used to quantify local spatial variation in multiple clinical and environmental predictor variables sampled in San Juan de Lurigancho, Lima, Peru. Initially, QuickBird 0.61 m data, encompassing visible bands and the near infra-red bands, were selected to synthesize images of land cover attributes of the study site. Data of residential addresses of individual patients with smear-positive MDR-TB were geocoded, prevalence rates calculated and then digitally overlaid onto the satellite data within a 2 km buffer of 31 georeferenced health centers, using a 10 m2 grid-based algorithm. Geographical information system (GIS)-gridded measurements of each health center were generated based on preliminary base maps of the georeferenced data aggregated to block groups and census tracts within each buffered area. A three-dimensional model of the study site was constructed based on a digital elevation model (DEM) to determine terrain covariates associated with the sampled MDR-TB covariates. Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the linear relationship between the DEM and the sampled MDR-TB data. A SAS/GIS(R) module was then used to calculate univariate statistics and to perform linear and non-linear regression analyses using the sampled predictor variables. The estimates generated from a global autocorrelation analyses were then spatially decomposed into empirical orthogonal bases using a negative binomial regression with a non-homogeneous mean. Results of the DEM analyses indicated a statistically non-significant, linear relationship between georeferenced health centers and the sampled covariate elevation. The data exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation and the decomposition of Moran's coefficient into uncorrelated, orthogonal map pattern components revealed global spatial heterogeneities necessary to capture latent autocorrelation in the MDR-TB model. It was thus shown that Poisson regression analyses and spatial eigenvector mapping can elucidate the mechanics of MDR-TB transmission by prioritizing clinical and environmental-sampled predictor variables for identifying high risk populations.},

  Abstract                 = {The phenomenon of drug resistance in tubercle bacilli (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) has been recognized since the early years of chemotherapy of tuberculosis (TB). However it was not until the mid-1990s, that the magnitude of the problem was highlighted by the first global report of the World Health Organization on the prevalence of anti-TB drug resistance. Up to now, four such reports have been released. Not only have they shown that drug resistance is present worldwide, but they have also demonstrated its expansiveness and a high tendency for progression. The two most detrimental forms of drug-resistant TB are multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. Whereas MDR-TB implies resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the most potent drugs in the first-line regimen, XDR-TB is defined as MDR-TB with resistance to any of the fluoroquinolones and any of the second-line injectable drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). The emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB are among the key factors contributing to the persistence of TB within the human population. This article outlines the current epidemiological status of drug-resistant TB in the world, Europe, and Poland.},

Recent studies have described XDR-TB strains from all continents. Worldwide prevalence of XDR-TB is estimated to be c. 6.6\% in all the studied countries among multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. The emergence of XDR-TB strains is a reflection of poor tuberculosis management, and controlling its emergence constitutes an urgent global health reality and a challenge to tuberculosis control activities in all parts of the world, especially in developing countries and those lacking resources and as well as in countries with increasing prevalence of HIV/AIDS.},

The definition has applicable clinical value and has allowed for more uniform surveillance in varied international settings. Recent surveillance data have indicated that the prevalence of tuberculosis drug resistance has risen to the highest rate ever recorded. The gold standard for drug-susceptibility testing has been the agar proportion method; however, this technique requires several weeks for results to be determined. More sensitive and specific diagnostic tests are still unavailable in resource-limited settings. Clinical manifestations, although variable in different settings and among different strains, have in general shown that XDR tuberculosis is associated with greater morbidity and mortality than non-XDR tuberculosis. The treatment of XDR tuberculosis should include agents to which the organism is susceptible, and should continue for a minimum of 18-24 months. However, treatment continues to be limited in tuberculosis-endemic countries largely because of weaknesses in national tuberculosis health-care models. The ultimate strategy to control drug-resistant tuberculosis is one that implements a comprehensive approach incorporating innovation from the political, social, economic, and scientific realms.},

  Abstract                 = {The largest recorded outbreak of a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), detected in Nigeria, provides a unique opportunity to analyze the pathogenicity of the virus, the clinical severity of the disease, and the effectiveness of control measures for cVDPVs as compared with wild-type poliovirus (WPV).We identified cases of acute flaccid paralysis associated with fecal excretion of type 2 cVDPV, type 1 WPV, or type 3 WPV reported in Nigeria through routine surveillance from January 1, 2005, through June 30, 2009. The clinical characteristics of these cases, the clinical attack rates for each virus, and the effectiveness of oral polio vaccines in preventing paralysis from each virus were compared.No significant differences were found in the clinical severity of paralysis among the 278 cases of type 2 cVDPV, the 2323 cases of type 1 WPV, and the 1059 cases of type 3 WPV. The estimated average annual clinical attack rates of type 1 WPV, type 2 cVDPV, and type 3 WPV per 100,000 susceptible children under 5 years of age were 6.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 5.9 to 7.7), 2.7 (95\% CI, 1.9 to 3.6), and 4.0 (95\% CI, 3.4 to 4.7), respectively. The estimated effectiveness of trivalent oral polio vaccine against paralysis from type 2 cVDPV was 38\% (95\% CI, 15 to 54\%) per dose, which was substantially higher than that against paralysis from type 1 WPV (13\%; 95\% CI, 8 to 18\%), or type 3 WPV (20\%; 95\% CI, 12 to 26\%). The more frequent use of serotype 1 and serotype 3 monovalent oral polio vaccines has resulted in improvements in vaccine-induced population immunity against these serotypes and in declines in immunity to type 2 cVDPV.The attack rate and severity of disease associated with the recent cVDPV identified in Nigeria are similar to those associated with WPV. International planning for the management of the risk of WPV, both before and after eradication, must include scenarios in which equally virulent and pathogenic cVDPVs could emerge.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this study was to propose a model for the ultrasonic frequency-dependent backscatter coefficient in cancellous bone. This model allows us to address the inverse problem and to predict the mean trabecular thickness. A weak scattering model is used and the backscatter coefficient is expressed in terms of an autocorrelation function of the medium. Different autocorrelation functions (Gaussian, exponential and densely populated media) were used to compute the backscatter coefficient and comparison is made with experimental data for 19 specimens and for frequency ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 MHz. For each specimen, a nonlinear regression was performed and the mean trabecular thickness is estimated. Experimental data and theoretical predictions were averaged over the 19 specimens. A good agreement between experimental data and predictions was found for both the magnitude and the frequency-dependence of the backscatter coefficient. We also found a good agreement between the experimental mean trabecular thickness (Tb. Th = 130 +/- 6.5 micro m) derived from the analysis of bone 3-D microarchitecture using high-resolution microtomography and theoretical predictions (d(Gauss) = 140 +/- 10 micro m, d(exponential) = 153 +/- 12.5 micro m and d(dense) = 138 +/- 6.5 micro m). These results open interesting prospects for the estimation of the mean trabecular thickness from in vivo measurements.},

Cumulative previous treatment duration (range, 18-34 months; odds ratio [OR], 5.6; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-59), number of previously received second-line anti-TB drugs (OR, 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.5), and female sex (OR, 3.2; 95\% CI, 1.1-8.3) were significantly associated with XDR TB in crude analyses. After controlling for other factors in a multivariable model, cumulative previous treatment duration remained significantly associated with XDR TB (OR, 5.8; 95\% CI, 1.0-61). Subjects with XDR TB were more likely to produce culture-positive sputum at 6 months, compared with patients with non-multidrug resistant TB (risk ratio, 13; 95\% CI, 5.1-53). Kanamycin resistance was found to be predictive of 6-month culture positivity after adjustment for ofloxacin and streptomycin resistance (risk ratio, 3.9; 95\% CI, 1.9-11).XDR TB was found to be associated with the cumulative duration of previous treatment with second-line TB drugs among subjects in a tertiary care TB hospital. Patients with XDR TB were more likely to not respond to therapy, and successful conversion of sputum culture results to negative was correlated with initial susceptibility to both fluoroquinolones and kanamycin but not to streptomycin.},

Smear positive pulmonary TB patients treated at the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were interviewed before start of treatment and during the fifth month of treatment using structured questionnaires. Information on treatment outcome was extracted from patient records. Patients cured at the end of treatment were compared to patients with unsuccessful treatment outcomes (failure, default, and death).A total of 841 patients were registered between January-June 2007 of which 792 (94\%) were cured. Independent risk factors for non-cure were having a low income (<3000 RMB per year), not having medical insurance, a delay in health care seeking >30 days, a positive smear test result two months after start of treatment, not being aware of the need to go to the CDC for medical follow up during treatment, and not seeing the need for treatment observation.Reducing the financial burden of TB disease and providing health education to improve compliance with treatment could increase the proportion of patients with successful treatment outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Websites opposing vaccination are prevalent on the Internet. Web 2.0, defined by interaction and user-generated content, has become ubiquitous. Furthermore, a new postmodern paradigm of healthcare has emerged, where power has shifted from doctors to patients, the legitimacy of science is questioned, and expertise is redefined. Together this has created an environment where anti-vaccine activists are able to effectively spread their messages. Evidence shows that individuals turn to the Internet for vaccination advice, and suggests such sources can impact vaccination decisions - therefore it is likely that anti-vaccine websites can influence whether people vaccinate themselves or their children. This overview examines the types of rhetoric individuals may encounter online in order to better understand why the anti-vaccination movement can be convincing, despite lacking scientific support for their claims. Tactics and tropes commonly used to argue against vaccination are described. This includes actions such as skewing science, shifting hypotheses, censoring dissent, and attacking critics; also discussed are frequently made claims such as not being "anti-vaccine" but "pro-safe vaccines", that vaccines are toxic or unnatural, and more. Recognizing disingenuous claims made by the anti-vaccination movement is essential in order to critically evaluate the information and misinformation encountered online.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet plays a large role in disseminating anti-vaccination information. This paper builds upon previous research by analyzing the arguments proffered on anti-vaccination websites, determining the extent of misinformation present, and examining discourses used to support vaccine objections. Arguments around the themes of safety and effectiveness, alternative medicine, civil liberties, conspiracy theories, and morality were found on the majority of websites analyzed; misinformation was also prevalent. The most commonly proposed method of combating this misinformation is through better education, although this has proven ineffective. Education does not consider the discourses supporting vaccine rejection, such as those involving alternative explanatory models of health, interpretations of parental responsibility, and distrust of expertise. Anti-vaccination protestors make postmodern arguments that reject biomedical and scientific "facts" in favour of their own interpretations. Pro-vaccination advocates who focus on correcting misinformation reduce the controversy to merely an "educational" problem; rather, these postmodern discourses must be acknowledged in order to begin a dialogue.},

WHO is optimistic regarding elimination of circulating virus from all of these countries in 2006 with the exception of Nigeria. Newly recognized obstacles to the eradication are the circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV) and those originating from immune deficient patients (iVDPV). Data are presented on the numbers and locations of cases of paralytic polio in 2004 and 2005 as reported to the WHO in early 2006. Scenarios for the maintenance of freedom from polio when/if the final cases occur are considered.},

Confirmed cattle herd TB incidence is the outcome measure used throughout. Relative to reactive culling, proactive badger culling was associated with a decrease in incidence in each of the 16 years of observation, which encompassed periods of both intensive and less-intensive badger removal. By 2004, we observed a decrease of 22\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 15-29, P<0.001] in the entire proactive and 37\% (95\% CI 25-47, P<0.001), in the inner proactive removal areas. The size of the decrease increased with time (P=0.055). There was a decrease (constant over time) of at least 14\% (95\% CI 76-97, P=0.013) in incidence in the inner compared to the outer control area (herds < or = 2 km, >2 km, from proactive removal area boundaries, respectively). Incidence in the outer proactive removal area (herds < 1.6 km from the proactive removal boundary) was similar to the inner control area (P=0.890). Incidence in the outer control area and total control area, compared to a neighbouring area some distance away, increased over the course of the study. Differences with the total control area were not statistically significant but the outer control area was 11\% higher than the neighbouring area by 2004 (borderline significance P=0.057).},

Using second-order intensity functions, we show there is strong evidence of clustering of TB cases in each the four areas, i.e. a global tendency for infected cases to occur near other infected cases. Using estimated intensity functions, we identify locations where particular strains of TB cluster. Generalized linear geostatistical models are used to assess the practical range at which spatial correlation occurs and is found to exceed 6 in all areas. The study is of relevance concerning the scale of localized badger culling in the control of the disease in cattle.},

Surgical resection of the patient's solitary cavitary lesion was done as adjunctive treatment, and a successful outcome with a combination of surgery and drug therapy was achieved. We review the history of surgical therapy for tuberculosis and reports of its role in treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis. 26 case series and cohort studies were included, and together showed that surgical resection is beneficial in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, the results might not be applicable in all settings because investigations were observational and typically included patients with less severe disease, and all surgeries were done at specialised thoracic-surgery centres. Well designed studies are needed to establish the efficacy of surgery in treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis.},

  Abstract                 = {In the United States, an increasingly disproportionate burden of tuberculosis among the foreign-born population has led to calls for improvements in the detection and treatment of latent infection in new immigrants. Current treatment guidelines do not take into account global differences in drug-resistance patterns or their implications for the treatment of immigrants. The use of multinational surveillance systems to guide the management of latent infection according to region-specific drug-resistance profiles could improve the efficiency of efforts to reduce the burden of tuberculosis in immigrants to the United States.We constructed a decision-analysis model by using a hypothetical cohort of all documented immigrants entering the United States from developing nations. Region-specific drug-resistance profiles were derived from data on 30,388 cases of infection. The model examined the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of four strategies: no intervention or tuberculin skin testing followed by treatment with isoniazid, treatment with rifampin, or treatment with rifampin plus pyrazinamide for those with a positive test result.A strategy of detecting and treating latent tuberculosis infection was cost-saving among immigrants from Mexico, Haiti, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and developing nations in East Asia and the Pacific. This strategy was highly cost effective among immigrants from other developing nations. Rifampin plus pyrazinamide was the preferred strategy for treating latent infection in immigrants from Vietnam, Haiti, and the Philippines.For new immigrants to the United States from developing nations, a strategy of detecting and treating latent tuberculosis infection would lead to substantial health and economic benefits. Because of the high prevalence of resistance to isoniazid, treatment with a rifampin-containing regimen should be strongly considered for immigrants from Vietnam, Haiti, and the Philippines.},

  Abstract                 = {Human plague has been an important public health problem in Tanzania for over a century. Recorded outbreaks of the disease have been reported from various parts of Tanzania, including Iringa, Kagera, Singida, Mbulu, Arusha and Kilimanjaro since 1886. Since 1980 however, only Lushoto, Singida and Karatu districts have experienced outbreaks of the disease. Of these areas, Lushoto has disproportionately high incidences of the disease and this has persisted for nearly 17 years. Efforts to curb the disease through conventional methods, including control of vectors and reservoirs, chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis, enforcement of sanitation improvement as well as health education, have been applied every year, but plague cases and deaths continue to occur in the area to date. During the period April 1980 to December 1996, a total of 6599 cases with 580 (8.8\%) deaths were recorded. Biological factors, such as the presence of suitable rodent reservoirs, efficient flea vectors and plague bacillus, could be partly responsible for the long persistence and reccurence of the disease. Since such factors are also common in other plague foci where the disease has never been persistently recurrent, and where indigenous people are culturally different from those in Lushoto, it is assumed that socio-cultural factors play an important role as determinants of the disease in the latter district. This paper reports preliminary observations on socio-cultural, biological and environmental factors which are thought to be, at least partly, responsible for the long persistence and repeated outbreaks of plague in the district. These include traditional beliefs on the cause and health seeking behaviour for treatment of plague, sleeping and food storage habits, large populations of rodents and fleas, and status of the immediate environment.},

Previously we developed a chemical systems biology approach to identify off-targets of major pharmaceuticals on a proteome-wide scale. In this paper we further demonstrate the value of this approach through the discovery that existing commercially available drugs, prescribed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, have the potential to treat MDR and XDR tuberculosis. These drugs, entacapone and tolcapone, are predicted to bind to the enzyme InhA and directly inhibit substrate binding. The prediction is validated by in vitro and InhA kinetic assays using tablets of Comtan, whose active component is entacapone. The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC(99)) of entacapone for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tuberculosis) is approximately 260.0 microM, well below the toxicity concentration determined by an in vitro cytotoxicity model using a human neuroblastoma cell line. Moreover, kinetic assays indicate that Comtan inhibits InhA activity by 47.0\% at an entacapone concentration of approximately 80 microM. Thus the active component in Comtan represents a promising lead compound for developing a new class of anti-tubercular therapeutics with excellent safety profiles. More generally, the protocol described in this paper can be included in a drug discovery pipeline in an effort to discover novel drug leads with desired safety profiles, and therefore accelerate the development of new drugs.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant (XDR) TB are big problems in the world. We have developed novel TB therapeutic vaccines, HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 + IL-12 DNA vaccine (HSP65-vaccine), granulysin vaccine and killer specific secretory protein of 37kDa (Ksp37) vaccine.   Methods and Results: HSP65 vaccine showed strong therapeutic effect against both MDR-TB and XDR-TB in mice. Intradermal immunization of HSP65-vaccine showed stronger therapeutic effect against TB than intramuscular or subcutaneous immunization. Furthermore, the synergistic therapeutic effect was observed when the vaccine was administrated in combination with Isoniazid (INH), which is a first line drug for chemotherapy. The combination of types of vaccines (HSP65- and granulysin- vaccines) also showed synergistic therapeutic effect. In the monkey model, granulysin-vaccine prolonged the survival period after the infection of TB and long-term survival was observed in vaccine-treated group. We examined the potential of two kinds of novel DNA vaccines (Ksp37-vaccine and granulysin-vaccine). Both vaccines augmented in vivo differentiation of CTL against TB. We measured the amount of Ksp37 protein in human serum and revealed that the level of Ksp37 protein of patients with tuberculosis was lower than that of healthy volunteers. Therefore, we established Ksp37 transgenic mice as well as granulysin transgenic mice to elucidate the function of those proteins. Both transgenic mice were resistant to TB infection. Conclusion: These data indicate the potential of combinational therapy; the combination of two DNA vaccines or combination of DNA vaccine with antibiotic drug. Thus, it will provide a novel strategy for the treatment of MDR-TB.},

This study investigated the effect of body mass index (BMI) on precision errors for lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (NOF), total hip (TH), and total body (TB) bone mineral density using the GE Lunar Prodigy. One hundred two women with BMIs ranging from 18.5 to 45.9 kg/m(2) were recruited. Participants had duplicate DXA scans of the LS, left hip, and TB with repositioning between scans. Participants were divided into 3 groups based on their BMI and the percentage coefficient of variation (\%CV) calculated for each group. The \%CVs for the normal (<25 kg/m(2)) (n=48), overweight (25-30 kg/m(2)) (n=26), and obese (>30 kg/m(2)) (n=28) BMI groups, respectively, were LS BMD: 0.99\%, 1.30\%, and 1.68\%; NOF BMD: 1.32\%, 1.37\%, and 2.00\%; TH BMD: 0.85\%, 0.88\%, and 1.06\%; TB BMD: 0.66\%, 0.73\%, and 0.91\%. Statistically significant differences in precision error between the normal and obese groups were found for LS (p=0.0006), NOF (p=0.005), and TB BMD (p=0.025). These results suggest that serial measurements in obese subjects should be treated with caution because the least significant change may be larger than anticipated.},

During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic a case of probable transmission during car travel was reported in Australia, to which spread via the airborne route may have contributed. However, there are no data to indicate the likely risks of such events, and how they may vary and be mitigated. To address this knowledge gap, we estimated the risk of airborne influenza transmission in two cars (1989 model and 2005 model) by employing ventilation measurements and a variation of the Wells-Riley model. Results suggested that infection risk can be reduced by not recirculating air; however, estimated risk ranged from 59\% to 99·9\% for a 90-min trip when air was recirculated in the newer vehicle. These results have implications for interrupting in-car transmission of other illnesses spread by the airborne route.},

Four hundred and twenty rural clusters and 180 urban clusters were selected from these districts on the basis of the rural-urban ratio in the entire zone. To obtain the required sample of 12,000 children without bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, 51,000 had to be covered. Eighty-five children from each cluster were tuberculin tested and read for reaction sizes. The ARTI was computed from the estimated prevalence of TB infection among children without a BCG scar.Among 52,951 children registered for the study, 50,846 (96\%) had a tuberculin test result. The BCG coverage for the study population was about 65\%. Among 17,811 children without a BCG scar, the prevalence of infection was 5.9\% (95\%CI 4.0-7.7\%); the corresponding ARTI was 1.0\% (95\%CI 0.7-1.4\%) [correction].The estimated ARTI for the south zone is 1.0\%, as compared to the national average of 1.7\% used for programme evaluation. This baseline information should be useful for the assessment of future trends.},

For example, a Ugandan study comparing home-based and facility-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery found that both delivered equivalent clinical outcomes, but home-based delivery resulted in substantial cost savings to patients; and a retrospective cohort analysis of an HIV care programme in Lesotho demonstrated that devolving routine patient management to nurses and trained counsellors resulted in impressive gains in annual enrolment, retention in care and other clinical indicators.Studies also demonstrated how the use of trained counsellors and public health advisors could effectively expand both clinical and public health capacity in low-income settings. Studies evaluating the impact of integrating HIV and TB care resulted in improved treatment outcomes in coinfected populations, the development of environmental interventions to reduce TB transmission, and uncovering of the extent of multi-drug-resistant and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB and XDR-TB) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.Some mathematical modelling and cost-effectiveness studies presented at this meeting addressed interventions to increase retention in care, and strengthened the evidentiary basis for universal voluntary testing and immediate ART on reducing HIV transmission; debate continued about the relative merits of clinical versus laboratory monitoring. Finally, a provocative plenary presentation outlined the shortfalls of current prevention interventions and argued for more cost-effectiveness analyses to guide the selection of interventions for maximum benefit.},

A review of the vaccination records shows that, in the case of first vaccinations for DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) and polio conducted by door-to-door visits, follow-up vaccinations had been better and the costs lower when primary school students made home visits encouraging mothers to take their children to a mobile vaccination unit and with participation of local benevolent organizations. Overall, third dose coverage for these two vaccinations was higher with community participation (regardless of type of community participation) than without it (78\% vs. 67\%). Without doubt, community participation has a favorable effect on vaccination coverage.},

Using the mathematical concept of fuzzy distance transformation (FDT), we evaluated the accuracy of measurements of trabecular distance (Tb.Di(f)) which can be determined for vertebrae in vivo using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT).In a first step extrema voxels with a very high likelihood of representing bone or marrow are identified. A probability level of being a bone voxel is assigned to all other voxel. This probability is based on the FDT of the voxel's gray-level, preprint submitted to Elsevier June 10, 2008; revised July 15, 2008 i.e. the shortest gray-value weighted distance to the marrow background. Next, the resulting bone structure is skeletonized. The space between the ridges of the skeleton is filled with the largest possible spheres. The average over the radii of the spheres defines Tb.Di(f), a measure of trabecular distance. 14 whole vertebrae embedded in polymethyl methylacrylate were scanned by HRCT (voxel size 156 x 156 x 400 mum(3)) inside an anthropomorphic abdomen phantom. Scans obtained on Scanco Xtreme CT (XCT, voxel size 82(3) microm(3)) without the phantom were used as reference.Tb.Di(f) calculated on XCT data were almost identical to trabecular distance values (1/Tb.N*) determined with the manufacturer's standard software (r(2)=0.98). Tb.Di(f) values obtained with HRCT correlated strongly with Tb.Di(f) values obtained by XCT (r(2)=0.89). Over the range from 400 to 1400 microm trabecular distance could be estimated with a residual error of 78 microm.The FDT based variable Tb.Di(f) provides 3D estimates of trabecular distances with residual errors of less than 100 microm using a HRCT protocol which also can be employed in vivo for assessing vertebral microarchitecture.},

Fifty patients received three-dimensional computed tomography examination preoperatively and after expansion; 24 had BB, and 26 had TB distraction. Predefined preoperative landmarks versus postexpansion positions were assessed in multiplanar viewing. Bone-borne devices had bigger overall skeletal and dental maxillary expansion declining from anterior to posterior, more asymmetric expansion, less vestibular bone resorption, and less dental tipping; TB devices showed similar dorsal decrease in transverse skeletal and dental maxillary expansion from anterior to posterior, more vestibular bone resorption, particularly in the premolars, and more dental tipping. Bone-borne 3S +PP G20 had the biggest decrease in transverse skeletal widening and biggest segmental outward inclination; BB 3S +PP 920 had the biggest decline in transverse dental widening; TB 2S YPP G20 had the biggest segmental inward inclination; BB 2S YPP 920 had the biggest dental tipping; BB 2S G20 had the biggest vestibular bone resorption in molars; and TB 3S 920 and BB YPP had the biggest vestibular bone resorption in premolars. There was a significant correlation between transverse widening and segmental inclination; that is, a bigger amount of transverse widening provokes less segmental inclination.},

Why this is so, and who might be a high-yield target for screening for latent TB infection, remain open questions. Foreign-born TB in Canada during 1986-2002 was retrospectively examined using national TB and immigration data as well as census data. Case counts and rates were analysed in relation to demographics, immigration period and time since arrival. Pre-1986 immigrants (n=3,860,853) and 1986-2002 immigrants (n=3,463,283) contributed 8,662 and 9,613 TB cases, respectively. Immigrants arriving ≤ 5 yrs ago and those arriving >10 yrs ago contributed almost equally to the annual foreign-born TB case count despite a 3.5-fold difference in in-country person-yrs. Remarkably stable and relatively low TB incidence was observed among immigrants >10 yrs post-arrival. Conversely, TB incidence within 5 yrs of arrival was dynamic, demonstrating a strong inverse association with time since arrival and higher sensitivity to changes in immigration level than shifts toward higher incidence source countries. Relative constancy in foreign-born TB incidence is explained by a complex convergence of several factors. Immigrants born in high-incidence countries who arrived ≤ 2 yrs ago and were aged 15-34 yrs upon arrival constitute high-yield targets for preventive therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a significant health problem in Panama. The extent to which such cases are the result of primary or acquired resistance and the strain families involved are unknown. We performed whole-genome sequencing of a collection of 66 clinical MDR isolates, along with 31 drug-susceptible isolates, that were isolated in Panama between 2001 and 2010; 78\% of the MDR isolates belong to the Latin American-Mediterranean (LAM) family. Drug resistance mutations correlated well with drug susceptibility profiles. To determine the relationships among these strains and to better understand the acquisition of resistance mutations, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on a genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis. The phylogenetic tree shows that the isolates are highly clustered, with a single strain (LAM9-c1) accounting for nearly one-half of the MDR isolates (29/66 isolates). The LAM9-c1 strain was most prevalent among male patients of working age and was associated with high mortality rates. Members of this cluster all share identical mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid (KatG S315T mutation), rifampin (RpoB S531L mutation), and streptomycin (rrs C517T mutation). This evidence of primary resistance supports a model in which MDR-TB in Panama is driven by clonal expansion and ongoing transmission of several strains in the LAM family, including the highly successful MDR strain LAM9-c1. The phylogenetic analysis also shows that the LAM9-c1 strain is closely related to the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) extensively drug-resistant TB strain identified in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The LAM9-c1 and KZN strains likely arose from a recent common ancestor that was transmitted between Panama and South Africa and had the capacity to tolerate an accumulation of multiple resistance mutations.},

We evaluated 3,707 VFR and 17,507 non-VFR travelers seen for pre-travel consultation in Global TravEpiNet during 2009-2011; all were traveling to resource-poor destinations. VFR travelers more commonly visited urban destinations than non-VFR travelers (42\% versus 30\%, P < 0.0001); 54\% of VFR travelers were female, and 18\% of VFR travelers were under 6 years old. VFR travelers sought health advice closer to their departure than non-VFR travelers (median days before departure was 17 versus 26, P < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, being a VFR traveler was an independent predictor of declining a recommended vaccine. Missed opportunities for vaccination could be addressed by improving the timing of pre-travel health care and increasing the acceptance of vaccines. Making pre-travel health care available in primary care settings may be one step to this goal.},

The drug susceptibility testing procedures included the proportion, absolute concentration and resistance ratio methods as well as their variants, including the radiometric BACTEC 460 method.The first round of proficiency testing has shown that the specificity of drug susceptibility testing within the SRL network was significantly higher than its sensitivity. The testing of isoniazid and rifampicin shows a high degree of agreement between the labs, but discordant results can be obtained with streptomycin and ethambutol.Drug susceptibility procedures for the testing of isoniazid and rifampicin, the two anti tuberculosis drugs which define multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, are highly reliable within the SRL network. Procedures for drug susceptibility testing of streptomycin and ethambutol are still in need of standardization.},

For these surveys, the ratio between the number of tuberculous infections (based on ARTI estimates) and the number of smear-positive TB cases was calculated and compared to the ratio of 8 to 12 tuberculous infections per prevalent smear- positive TB case as part of the Styblo rule.Three countries had national population-based data on both ARTI and prevalence of smear-positive TB for more than one point in time. In China the ratio ranged from 3.4 to 5.8, in the Philippines from 2.6 to 4.4, and in the Republic of Korea, from 3.2 to 4.7. All ratios were markedly lower than the ratio that is part of the Styblo rule.According to recent country data, there are typically fewer than 8 to 12 tuberculous infections per prevalent smear-positive TB case, and it remains unclear whether this ratio varies significantly among countries. The decrease in the ratio compared to the Styblo rule probably relates to improvements in the prompt treatment of TB disease (by national TB programmes). A change in the number of tuberculous infections per prevalent smear-positive TB case in population-based surveys makes the assumed fixed mathematical relationship between ARTI and incidence of smear-positive TB no longer valid.},

Due to the success of the measles mortality reduction and elimination efforts thus far, the WHO has raised the question of whether global eradication of measles is economically feasible.The cost-effectiveness of various measles mortality reduction and eradication scenarios was evaluated vis-à-vis the current mortality reduction goal in six countries and globally. Data collection on costs of measles vaccination were conducted in six countries in four regions: Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, Tajikistan, and Uganda. The number of measles cases and deaths were projected from 2010 to 2050 using a dynamic, age-structured compartmental model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were then calculated for each scenario vis a vis the baseline.Measles eradication by 2020 was the found to be the most cost-effective scenario, both in the six countries and globally. Eradicating measles by 2020 is projected to cost an additional discounted $7.8 billion and avert a discounted 346 million DALYs between 2010 and 2050.In conclusion, the study found that, compared to the baseline, reaching measles eradication by 2020 would be the most cost-effective measles mortality reduction scenario, both for the six countries and on a global basis.},

Tubercle bacilli are thought to encounter these conditions in humans during latent infection. In this study, immune responses were evaluated to 25 most strongly induced DosR-regulon-encoded proteins, referred to as latency antigens. Proliferation assays were performed using M. tuberculosis-specific T-cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from tuberculosis (TB) patients, tuberculin skin test positive (TST+) individuals and uninfected controls. All 25 latency antigens were able to induce production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by T-cell lines. Eighteen latency antigens were also recognized by PBMC of M. tuberculosis-infected individuals, which indicates expression of the DosR-regulon during natural infection. Differential analysis showed that TST+ individuals recognized more latency antigens and with a stronger cumulative IFN-gamma response than TB patients, while the opposite profile was found for culture filtrate protein-10. In particular Rv1733c, Rv2029c, Rv2627c and Rv2628 induced strong IFN-gamma responses in TST+ individuals, with 61\%, 61\%, 52\% and 35\% responders, respectively. In conclusion, several new M. tuberculosis antigens were identified within the DosR-regulon. Particularly strong IFN-gamma responses to latency antigens were observed in latently infected individuals, suggesting that immune responses against these antigens may contribute to controlling latent M. tuberculosis infection.},

  Abstract                 = {mRNA is a marker of cell viability. Quantifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis mRNA in sputum is a promising tool for monitoring response to antituberculosis therapy and evaluating the efficacy of individual drugs. mRNA levels were measured in sputum specimens from patients with tuberculosis (TB) receiving monotherapy in an early bactericidal activity study of fluoroquinolones and in those receiving a standard rifampin-based regimen in an interleukin-2 (IL-2) trial. In the early bactericidal activity study, sputum for quantitative culture and mRNA analysis was collected for 2 days before and daily during 7 days of study drug administration. In the IL-2 trial, sputum was collected for quantitative culture, Bactec 460 liquid culture, and mRNA analysis throughout the intensive treatment phase. RNA was isolated from digested sputum and tested in quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays for several gene targets. mRNA for the glyoxylate cycle enzyme isocitrate lyase declined at similar rates in patients receiving isoniazid, gatifloxicin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin monotherapy. Isocitrate lyase mRNA correlated highly with CFU in sputum prior to therapy and during 7 days of monotherapy in all treatment arms. Isocitrate lyase mRNA was detectable in sputum of culture-positive TB patients receiving a rifampin-based regimen for 1 month. At 2 months, sputum for isocitrate mRNA correlated more closely with growth in liquid culture than did growth on solid culture medium. Data suggest that isocitrate lyase mRNA is a reliable marker of M. tuberculosis viability.},

  Abstract                 = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is primarily transmitted by bio-aerosol droplets or direct personal contacts. This paper presents a detailed study of environmental evidence of possible airborne transmission in a hospital ward during the largest nosocomial SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Retrospective on-site inspections and measurements of the ventilation design and air distribution system were carried out on July 17, 2003. Limited on-site measurements of bio-aerosol dispersion were also carried out on July 22. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the bio-aerosol dispersion in the hospital ward. We attempted to predict the air distribution during the time of measurement in July 2003 and the time of exposure in March 2003. The predicted bio-aerosol concentration distribution in the ward seemed to agree fairly well with the spatial infection pattern of SARS cases. Possible improvement to air distribution in the hospital ward was also considered.Our study revealed the need for the development of improved ventilation and air-conditioning systems in an isolation ward or a general hospital ward for infectious respiratory diseases. The outbreak in Ward 8A, which was in a general hospital and could house nearly 40 patients, demonstrated the cross-infection risks of respiratory infectious diseases in hospitals if a potential highly infectious patient was not identified and isolated. Our example simulation, which extended the SARS Busters' design for an isolation room to Ward 8A, demonstrated that there was room for improvement to minimize cross-infection in large general hospital wards.},

  Abstract                 = {There have been few recent studies demonstrating a definitive association between the transmission of airborne infections and the ventilation of buildings. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and current concerns about the risk of an avian influenza (H5N1) pandemic, have made a review of this area timely. We searched the major literature databases between 1960 and 2005, and then screened titles and abstracts, and finally selected 40 original studies based on a set of criteria. We established a review panel comprising medical and engineering experts in the fields of microbiology, medicine, epidemiology, indoor air quality, building ventilation, etc. Most panel members had experience with research into the 2003 SARS epidemic. The panel systematically assessed 40 original studies through both individual assessment and a 2-day face-to-face consensus meeting. Ten of 40 studies reviewed were considered to be conclusive with regard to the association between building ventilation and the transmission of airborne infection. There is strong and sufficient evidence to demonstrate the association between ventilation, air movements in buildings and the transmission/spread of infectious diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox and SARS. There is insufficient data to specify and quantify the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals, schools, offices, homes and isolation rooms in relation to spread of infectious diseases via the airborne route. PRACTICAL IMPLICATION: The strong and sufficient evidence of the association between ventilation, the control of airflow direction in buildings, and the transmission and spread of infectious diseases supports the use of negatively pressurized isolation rooms for patients with these diseases in hospitals, in addition to the use of other engineering control methods. However, the lack of sufficient data on the specification and quantification of the minimum ventilation requirements in hospitals, schools and offices in relation to the spread of airborne infectious diseases, suggest the existence of a knowledge gap. Our study reveals a strong need for a multidisciplinary study in investigating disease outbreaks, and the impact of indoor air environments on the spread of airborne infectious diseases.},

Socio-demographic and clinical data were retrieved from medical records and analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with poor treatment outcomes and Cox proportional hazards regression model was further used to determine risk factors associated with death in TB patients. Among the 3,551 non-repetitive hospitalized TB patients who had drug susceptibility testing (DST) results, 716 (20.2\%) had MDR-TB and 51 (1.4\%) had XDR-TB. A total of 3,270 patients who had medical records available were used for further analyses. Treatment success rates (cured and treatment completed) were 90.9\%, 53.4\% and 29.2\% for patients with non-MDR-TB, patients with MDR-TB excluding XDR-TB and patients with XDR-TB, respectively. Independent risk factors associated with poor treatment outcomes in MDR-TB patients included being a migrant (adjusted OR = 1.77), smear-positivity at treatment onset (adjusted OR = 1.94) and not receiving 3 or more potentially effective drugs (adjusted OR = 3.87). Independent risk factors associated with poor treatment outcomes in XDR-TB patients were smear-positivity at treatment onset (adjusted OR = 10.42) and not receiving 3 or more potentially effective drugs (adjusted OR = 14.90). The independent risk factors associated with death in TB patients were having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adjusted HR = 5.25) and having hypertension (adjusted HR = 4.31).While overall satisfactory treatment success for non-MDR-TB patients was achieved, more intensive efforts should be made to better manage MDR- and XDR-TB cases in order to improve their treatment outcomes and to minimize further emergence of so-called totally drug-resistant TB cases.},

Data from a subsample of the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used. Serum albumin, total bilirubin (TB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) served as the outcome variables. Personal exposures to benzene, chloroform, ethylbenzene, tetrachloroethene, toluene, trichloroethene, o-xylene, m-,p-xylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) were assessed through the use of passive exposure monitors worn by study participants. The first two canonical correlations were 0.3218 and 0.2575, suggesting a positive correlation mainly between the six VOCs (benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-,p-xylene, and MTBE) and the three biochemical liver tests (albumin, ALP, and GGT) and a positive correlation mainly between the two VOCs (1,4-dichlorobenzene and tetrachloroethene) and the two biochemical liver tests (LDH and TB). Subsequent multiple linear regressions show that exposure to benzene, toluene, or MTBE was associated with serum albumin, while exposure to tetrachloroethene was associated with LDH and total bilirubin. In conclusion, exposure to certain VOCs as a group or individually may influence certain biochemical liver test results in the general population.},

We investigated bone mineral density (BMD) in black South African women, with and without a history of load-carrying on the head. We also investigated whether load carrying may offer protection against low BMD in users of injectable progestin contraception (IPC). Participants were 32 black, South African women (22.4 +/- 3.2 years). Load carrying history was determined by questionnaire and interview; participants were grouped as load carriers (LC; n = 18) or non-load carriers (NLC; n = 14). Ten women were using IPC and 6 were load-carriers. Total body (TB), lumbar spine (LS) and total hip (H) BMD were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. There were no differences in BMD between LC and NLC, and after controlling for age and BMI using two-tailed partial correlations. IPC users had lower BMD at all sites compared to non-IPC users (p < 0.05) and there were no associations between load carrying and BMD in this group. When IPC users were excluded from analysis, LC had higher LS BMD than NLC (p < 0.005). Correlations were found between the weight of load carried and LS BMD (r = 0.743, p < 0.005), and between years of load carrying and LS and TB BMD (r = 0.563, r = 0.538, respectively; both p < 0.05). Load carrying on the head may offer osteogenic benefits to the spine but these benefits did not appear in women using IPC.},

The current vaccine M. bovis Calmette-Guérin (BCG) demonstrates variable efficacy and so a more robust strategy to either replace, or more likely supplement it, is required. Prime-boost strategies where immunity induced by BCG is boosted by a second heterologous vaccine represent a promising avenue of research. We have evaluated the ability of a protein subunit vaccine using the antigen Rv3019c to either prime or boost immunity induced by BCG in a murine M. bovis challenge model. Despite the induction of anamnestic T cell responses, we report that antigen-independent immune stimulation with adjuvant in conjunction with BCG could enhance the level of protection induced by BCG alone. Importantly this improved protection correlated with pre-infection frequencies of ex vivo IFN-gamma producing cells in the spleen, providing a possible surrogate correlate of protection for future vaccination studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluoroquinolones are important second-line drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis. A comprehensive profile of resistance mutation patterns of DNA gyrase, the major target of fluoroquinolones, is crucial for molecular diagnosis of drug resistance and improvement of treatment efficacy. To investigate the mutation types of the genes encoding the A and B subunits of DNA gyrase (gyrA and gyrB, respectively) in ofloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains prevalent in mainland China, 177 clinical drug-resistant isolates collected by the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory of China were analysed. The GyrB single mutations (Glu498 and Gly551) and double mutation (Thr539Asn-Gly551Arg) as well as a GyrA double mutation (Asp94Asn-Gly112His) were reported to be involved in fluoroquinolone resistance for the first time. To simplify quantification of the contribution of each mutation type and mutation site to overall fluoroquinolone resistance, a mathematical method was established by assigning each resistance allele a numerical score between 5 and 50 (the larger the number, the higher the resistance level). The score of double mutants is the sum of the scores for the two single alleles. The double mutation types, including Asn538Ile(GyrB)-Asp94Ala(GyrA), Ala543Val(GyrB)-Asp94Asn(GyrA) and Ala543Val(GyrB)-Asp94Gly(GyrA) scored relatively high by this methodology.},

Diabetes is a risk factor for acquisition of and worse outcomes from A. baumannii infection. We sought to develop diabetic mouse models of A. baumannii bacteraemia and pneumonia and validate these models by comparing the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in these models with the established neutropenic mouse models.Diabetic or neutropenic mice were infected via intravenous inoculation or inhalation in an aerosol chamber with an XDR A. baumannii. Treatment with colistin started 24 h after infection and continued daily for 7 days. Survival served as the primary endpoint while tissue bacterial burden and histopathological examination served as secondary endpoints.Lethal infection was achieved for the neutropenic and diabetic mice when infected intravenously or via inhalation. Neutropenic mice were more susceptible to infection than diabetic mice in the pneumonia model and equally susceptible in the bacteraemia model. Both models of bacteraemia were sensitive enough to detect virulence differences among different clinical strains of A. baumannii. In the pneumonia model, colistin treatment was effective in improving survival, reducing lung bacterial burden and histologically resolving the infection compared with placebo only in diabetic mice.We developed novel models of A. baumannii bacteraemia and pneumonia in diabetic mice. These models can be used to study mechanisms of infection, develop immunotherapeutic strategies and evaluate drug efficacies against highly lethal A. baumannii infections.},

  Abstract                 = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA and 5S RNA, Escherichia coli 5S RNA, and wheat germ 5S RNA have each been specifically spin-labeled at the 3'-terminal ribose to give morpholino-spin-labeled (MSL) RNAs. Enzymatic hydrolysis with pancreatic RNase, followed by anion-exchange chromatography, confirms the site of attachment of the spin-label. Effective rotational correlation times, TB and TC, have been determined from electron spin resonance (ESR) peak heights and widths as a function of temperature for each MSL RNA, and Arrhenius plots of -log T vs. 1/T have been constructed. TC is a measure of internal flexibility at the link between the label and the RNA, while TB is a measure of rotational flexibility of the RNA near the labeled site. Validity of the TB and TC determination has been confirmed from simulation of the experimental EPR spectra by theoretical spectra computed for various attachment geometries and motional rates. Discontinuities in the slope of Arrhenius plots for TB were seen at 34 and 66 degrees C (yeast MSL tRNA), 37 and 60 degrees C (E. coli MSL 5S RNA), 37 and 57 degrees C (yeast MSL 5S RNA), and 36 and 54 degrees C (wheat germ MSL 5S RNA). Temperature-induced hydrolysis of each MSL RNA was less than 5\% as determined by gel-filtration chromatography. The melting curves are consistent with a recently proposed universal secondary structural model for prokaryotic and eukaryotic 5S RNA.},

In the past decade, ten compounds have progressed into the clinical development pipeline, including six new compounds specifically developed for tuberculosis. Despite this progress, the global drug pipeline for tuberculosis is still insufficient to address the unmet needs of treatment. Additional and sustainable efforts, and funding are needed to further improve the pipeline. The key challenges in the development of new treatments are the needs for novel drug combinations, new trial designs, studies in paediatric populations, increased clinical trial capacity, clear regulatory guidelines, and biomarkers for prediction of long-term outcome. Despite substantial progress in efforts to control tuberculosis, the global burden of this disease remains high. To eliminate tuberculosis as a public health concern by 2050, all responsible parties need to work together to strengthen the global antituberculosis drug pipeline and support the development of new antituberculosis drug regimens.},

It sets out the key actions needed to achieve the targets of the Millennium Development Goals relating to tuberculosis (TB): to halve the prevalence and deaths by 2015 relative to 1990 levels and to save 14 million lives. Developed by a broad coalition of partners, the plan presents a model approach combining interventions that can feasibly be supplied on the ground. The main areas of activity set out in the plan are: scaling up interventions to control tuberculosis; promoting the research and development of improved diagnostics, drugs and vaccines; and engaging in related activities for advocacy, communications and social mobilization. Scenarios for the planning process were developed; these looked at issues both globally and in seven epidemiological regions. The scenarios made ambitious but realistic assumptions about the pace of scale-up and implementation coverage of the activities. A mathematical model was used to estimate the impact of scaling up current interventions based on data from studies of tuberculosis biology and from experience with tuberculosis control in diverse settings. The estimated costs of the activities set out in the Global Plan were based on implementing interventions and researching and developing drugs, diagnostics and vaccines; these costs were US$ 56 billion over 10 years. When translated into cost per disability adjusted life year averted, these costs compare favourably with those of other public health interventions. This approach to planning for global tuberculosis control is a valuable example of developing plans to improve global health that has relevance for other health issues.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study was to use high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging combined with image analysis to investigate the three-dimensional (3D) trabecular structure, anisotropy, and connectivity of human vertebral, femoral, and calcaneal specimens. The goal was to determine whether: (a) MR-derived measures depict known skeletal-site-specific differences in architecture and orientation of trabeculae; (b) 3D architectural parameters combined with bone mineral density (BMD) improve the prediction of the elastic modulus using a fabric tensor formulation; (c) MR-derived 3D architectural parameters combined with BMD improve the prediction of strength using a multiple regression model, and whether these results corresponded to the results obtained using higher resolution depictions of trabecular architecture. A total of 94 specimens (12 x 12 x 12 mm cubes) consisting of trabecular bone only were obtained, of which there were 7 from the calcaneus, 15 from distal femur, 47 from the proximal femur, and 25 from the vertebral bodies. MR images were obtained using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner at a spatial resolution of 117 x 117 x 300 microm. Additionally, BMD was determined using quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and the specimens were nondestructively tested and the elastic modulus (YM) was measured along three orthogonal axes corresponding to the anatomic superior-inferior (axial), medial-lateral (sagittal), and anterior-posterior (coronal) directions. A subset of the specimens (n=67) was then destructively tested in the superior-inferior (axial) direction to measure the ultimate compressive strength. The MR images were segmented into bone and marrow phases and then analyzed in 3D. Ellipsoids were fitted to the mean intercept lengths, using single value decomposition and the primary orientation of the trabeculae and used to calculate the anisotropy of trabecular architecture. Stereological measures were derived using a previously developed model and measures such as mean trabecular width, spacing, and number were derived. Because the spatial resolution of MR images is comparable to trabecular bone dimensions, these measures may be subject to partial volume effects and were thus treated as apparent measures, such as BV/TV, Tb.Sp, Tb.N, and Tb.Th rather than absolute measures, as would be derived from histomorphometry. In addition, in a subset of specimens, the Euler number per unit volume was determined to characterize the connectivity of the trabecular network. There were significant differences in the BMD, trabecular architectural measures, elastic modulus, and strength at the different skeletal sites. The primary orientation axes for most of the specimens was the anatomic superior-inferior (axial) direction. Using the fabric tensor formulation, in addition to BMD, improved the prediction of YM (SI), while including some of the architectural parameters significantly improved the prediction of strength. In comparing MR-derived 3D measures with those obtained from 20 microm optical images (n=18; 9 vertebrae, 9 femur specimens), good correlations were found for the apparent Tb.Sp and Tb.N, moderate correlation was seen for the apparent BV/TV, and poor correlation was found for the apparent Tb.Th. Using these higher resolution images, the fabric tensor formulation for predicting the elastic modulus also showed improved correlation between the measured and calculated modulus in the axial (SI) direction. In summary, high-resolution MR images may be used to assess 3D architecture of trabecular bone, and the inclusion of some of the 3D architectural measures provides an improved assessment of biomechanical properties. Further studies are clearly warranted to establish the role of architecture in predicting overall bone quality, and the role of trabecular architecture measures in clinical practice.

Data on time trends in tuberculosis case notification rates and on HIV infection prevalence in adults and in tuberculosis patients were used, along with data on tuberculosis control programme performance.In 2006, the estimated smear-positive tuberculosis CDR in HIV-negative adults was 79\% (95\% confidence interval, CI: 64-94) and in HIV-positive adults, 57\% (95\% CI: 26-88), giving a weighted mean of 68\% (95\% CI: 49-87). The separate estimate for all smear-positive tuberculosis cases was 72\% (95\% CI: 53-91), giving an overall average for the three estimates of 70\% (95\% CI: 58-82). As the tuberculosis CDR in 1996 was 57\% (95\% CI: 47-67), the estimated increase by 2006 was 13 percentage points (95\% CI: 6-20), or 23\%. This increase was accompanied by a more than doubling of the resources devoted to tuberculosis control in Kenya, including facilities and staff.Using three approaches to estimate the tuberculosis CDR in a country where HIV infection is prevalent, we showed that expansion of the tuberculosis control programme in Kenya led to an increase of 23\% in the CDR between 1996 and 2006. While the methods developed here can be applied in other countries with a high prevalence of HIV infection, they rely on precise data on trends in such prevalence in the general population and among tuberculosis patients.},

  Abstract                 = {The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is complex. Experimental evidence has revealed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays a major role in host defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of infection. TNF-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB), in accordance with animal studies. The present study takes a computational approach toward characterizing the role of TNF in protection against the tubercle bacillus in both active and latent infection. We extend our previous mathematical models to investigate the roles and production of soluble (sTNF) and transmembrane TNF (tmTNF). We analyze effects of anti-TNF therapy in virtual clinical trials (VCTs) by simulating two of the most commonly used therapies, anti-TNF antibody and TNF receptor fusion, predicting mechanisms that explain observed differences in TB reactivation rates. The major findings from this study are that bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor for causing reactivation of latent infection and that sTNF--even at very low levels--is essential for control of infection. Using a mathematical model, it is possible to distinguish mechanisms of action of the anti-TNF treatments and gain insights into the role of TNF in TB control and pathology. Our study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed that could balance the requirement for reduction of inflammation with the necessity to maintain resistance to infection and microbial diseases. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-TNF therapy could be modified. Anti-TNF therapy will likely lead to numerous incidents of primary TB if used in areas where exposure is likely.},

  Abstract                 = {Diferric transferrin was modified using aquopentaammine ruthenium(II), a reagent for surface-accessible uncoordinated histidines. Introduction of the cationic Ru(III) (NH3)3 + 5 group on the imidazole of only 5.5 of the 17 uncoordinated histidines enhances the rates of pyrophosphate-assisted iron removal from the N-terminal and C-terminal binding sites by 16- and 2-fold, respectively. This differential effect on the kinetics of the two sites may partially explain why in the native protein the N-terminal site is more labile than the C-terminal site in acidic solutions where histidine residues become positively charged through protonation. The distance between the metal site and nearby uncoordinated histidines was estimated from fluorescence energy transfer measurements using Tb (III) as the donor and pentaammine ruthenium(III)-labeled imidazole of histidine as the acceptor chromophore. A Tsou Chen-Lu statistical analysis of the fluorescence quenching data suggest that two residues in each lobe of the protein are involved in quenching the fluorescence. By using estimates for the index of refraction and the quantum yield and assuming the energy transfer follows parallel first-order kinetics, an upper limit for the donor-acceptor distance of about 1.4 nm was obtained, assuming two uncoordinated histidine residues equidistant from the metal. His-207 and His-242 in the N-terminal lobe of transferrin and His-535 and His-577 in the C-terminal lobe are within this distance, based on information from the lactoferrin crystal structure. It is postulated that His-207 in the N-terminal lobe and His-535 in the C-terminal lobe are the uncoordinated residues that, when protonated or modified with Ru(III) (NH3)3 + 5, lead to accelerated loss of iron from the two binding sites of the protein.},

The model predicts the sigmoidal shape of TB deposition patterns measured in human subjects, the slopes of the quasilinear segments of these curves, and the positions of their two asymptotes. The model could therefore be used to evaluate the health effects of toxic airborne particles.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work we study a plankton ecosystem model in a turbulent flow. The plankton model we consider contains logistic growth with a spatially varying background carrying capacity and the flow dynamics are generated using the two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations. We characterize the system in terms of a dimensionless parameter, gamma identical with TB/TF, which is the ratio of the ecosystem biological time scales TB and the flow time scales TF. We integrate this system numerically for different values of gamma until the mean plankton reaches a statistically stationary state and examine how the steady-state mean and variance of plankton depends on gamma. Overall we find that advection in the presence of a nonuniform background carrying capacity can lead to very different plankton distributions depending on the time scale ratio gamma. For small gamma the plankton distribution is very similar to the background carrying capacity field and has a mean concentration close to the mean carrying capacity. As gamma increases the plankton concentration is more influenced by the advection processes. In the largest gamma cases there is a homogenization of the plankton concentration and the mean plankton concentration approaches the harmonic mean, <1/K>(-1). We derive asymptotic approximations for the cases of small and large gamma. We also look at the dependence of the power spectra exponent, beta, on gamma where the power spectrum of plankton is proportional to k(-beta). We find that the power spectra exponent closely obeys beta=1+2/gamma as predicted by earlier studies using simple models of chaotic advection.},

  Abstract                 = {With >8 million new cases in 2010, particularly documented in developing countries, tuberculosis (TB) is still a highly present pandemic and often terminal. This is also due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains (MDR-TB and XDR-TB) of the primary causative TB agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Efforts to develop new effective drugs against MTB are restrained by the unique and largely impermeable composition of the mycobacterial cell wall.Based on a database of antimycobacterial substances (CDD TB), 3815 compounds were classified as active and thus permeable. A data mining approach was conducted to gather the physico-chemical similarities of these substances and delimit them from a generic dataset of drug-like molecules. On the basis of the differences in these datasets, a regression model was generated and implemented into the online tool MycPermCheck to predict the permeability probability of small organic compounds. Discussion: Given the current lack of precise molecular criteria determining mycobacterial permeability, MycPermCheck represents an unprecedented prediction tool intended to support antimycobacterial drug discovery. It follows a novel knowledge-driven approach to estimate the permeability probability of small organic compounds. As such, MycPermCheck can be used intuitively as an additional selection criterion for potential new inhibitors against MTB. Based on the validation results, its performance is expected to be of high practical value for virtual screening purposes.The online tool is freely accessible under the URL http://www.mycpermcheck.aksotriffer.pharmazie.uni-wuerzburg.de},

  Abstract                 = {The objectives of this study were to estimate response to divergent selection for an index of placental efficiency in swine, and to evaluate the effect of placental efficiency on litter size. The selection index (SI) included total born (TB), birth weight (BRWT), and placental weight (PW), and was designed to increase in the high line (H) or decrease in the low line (L) the efficiency of the placental function (PE), defined as the ratio BRWT:PW. (Co)variance components were estimated for direct and maternal additive effects by using an animal model with MTDFREML procedures. Estimated breeding values were calculated by using records on individual BRWT (n = 2,111), PW (n = 2,006), PE (n = 1,677), and SI (n = 1,677). Litter traits were evaluated using records on 193 litters. The model included the fixed effects of contemporary group for all traits, with the addition of sex for individual traits and parity for litter traits. Litter was fitted as an uncorrelated random effect for all traits, and TB was used as a linear and quadratic covariate for BRWT, PW, and PE. Direct heritability estimates from single-trait models were 0.03, 0.25, 0.18, 0.11, and 0.08 for BRWT, PW, PE, SI, and TB, respectively. Estimated breeding values were compared between lines by using a model including generation, line within generation, and replicate within line as the error term. Estimates of genetic divergence were 20.7 +/- 2.7 g, 0.24 +/- 0.03, 0.11 +/- 0.02, and 0.07 +/- 0.02 per generation for PW, PE, SI, and TB, respectively (P < 0.01), but divergence was not significant for BRWT. At Generation 4, direct EBV was higher in L than in H for PW (55.9 +/- 8.7 vs. -24.2 +/- 9.5 g, respectively; P < 0.01) and higher in H than in L for PE (0.58 +/- 0.10 vs. -0.35 +/- 0.09 g, respectively; P < 0.01). However, EBV was not different for BRWT, SI, or TB. These results indicate that PW and PE are susceptible to change by genetic selection; however, the correlated response in TB was an unexpected genetic trend toward a higher TB in L of 0.05 +/- 0.01 piglets per generation (P < 0.01).},

  Abstract                 = {Childhood rubella infection in early pregnancy can lead to fetal death or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) with multiple disabilities. Reduction of transmission via universal vaccination can prevent CRS, but inadequate coverage may increase CRS numbers by increasing the average age at infection. Consequently, many countries do not vaccinate against rubella. The World Health Organization recommends that for safe rubella vaccination, at least 80\% coverage of each birth cohort should be sustained. The nonlinear relationship between CRS burden and infection dynamics has been much studied; however, how the complex interaction between epidemic and demographic dynamics affects minimum safe levels of coverage has not been quantitatively evaluated across scales necessary for a global assessment. We modelled 30-year CRS burdens across epidemiological and demographic settings, including the effect of local interruption of transmission via stochastic fadeout. Necessary minimum vaccination coverage increases markedly with birth and transmission rates, independent of amplitude of seasonal fluctuations in transmission. Susceptible build-up in older age groups following local stochastic extinction of rubella increased CRS burden, indicating that spatial context is important. In low birth-rate settings, 80\% routine coverage is a conservative guideline, particularly if supplemented with campaigns and vaccination of women of childbearing age. Where birth and transmission rates are high, immunization coverage must be well above 80\% and campaigns may be needed. Policy-makers should be aware of the potential negative effect of local extinction of rubella, since heterogeneity in vaccination coverage will shape extinction patterns, potentially increasing CRS burdens.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently, no information is available on the effect of resistance/susceptibility to first-line drugs different from isoniazid and rifampicin in determining the outcome of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) patients, and whether being XDR-TB is a more accurate indicator of poor clinical outcome than being resistant to all first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs. To investigate this issue, a large series of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and XDR-TB cases diagnosed in Estonia, Germany, Italy and the Russian Federation during the period 1999-2006 were analysed. Drug-susceptibility testing for first- and second-line anti-TB drugs, quality assurance and treatment delivery was performed according to World Health Organization recommendations in all study sites. Out of 4,583 culture-positive TB cases analysed, 361 (7.9\%) were MDR and 64 (1.4\%) were XDR. XDR-TB cases had a relative risk (RR) of 1.58 to have an unfavourable outcome compared with MDR-TB cases resistant to all first-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin ethambutol, streptomycin and, when tested, pyrazinamide), and an RR of 2.61 compared with "other" MDR-TB cases (those susceptible to at least one first-line anti-TB drug among ethambutol, pyrazinamide and streptomycin, regardless of resistance to the second-line drugs not defining XDR-TB). The emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis confirms that problems in tuberculosis management are still present in Europe. While waiting for new tools which will facilitate management of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, accessibility to quality diagnostic and treatment services should be urgently ensured and adequate public health policies should be rapidly implemented to prevent further development of drug resistance.},

  Abstract                 = {TB is the most prevalent infection in the world. The emergence of the HIV epidemic has dramatically increased the risk of developing clinical TB in infected persons, substantially increasing TB rates globally. Preventive therapy with INH for 6 to 12 months substantially reduces the risk of developing clinical TB in persons with tuberculous infection. Yet, preventive therapy is not fully used because of lack of knowledge about TB among health care professionals, patient nonadherence with preventive therapy regimens, and drug toxicity. Persons at high risk for developing TB should be screened for infection with a tuberculin skin test and given preventive therapy when appropriate. Promising new regimens of shorter duration and new drug delivery systems are currently being evaluated. Preventive therapy must be widely adopted if the goals of TB control and eventual elimination are to be achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis (TB) control is especially difficult in settings of high HIV prevalence; HIV co-infection erodes host immunity and increases risk of progression to active TB. Studies have demonstrated that a 6-month (or longer) course of monotherapy with isoniazid [isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT)] can reduce this risk. The World Health Organization endorses IPT for symptom-free individuals with HIV/TB co-infection and has recommended expanding IPT to entire communities (community-wide IPT). Although previous reviews have not found a statistically significant elevated risk of isoniazid-resistant TB among individuals previously treated with IPT, community-wide IPT programs may nonetheless generate substantial selective pressure and increase the burden of drug-resistant TB (DRTB). We developed mathematical models to identify the conditions under which community-wide IPT interventions could increase the burden of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, even when we assumed that IPT does not select for resistance among those treated with IPT. We found that in models that included any mechanism of interstrain competition (such as partial immunity conferred by a previous M. tuberculosis infection), community-wide IPT interventions conferred an indirect benefit to drug-resistant strains through selective suppression of drug-sensitive infections. This result suggests that the absence of an observed elevation in the risk of DRTB among those receiving IPT in small-scale studies of limited duration does not imply that the selective pressure imposed by community-wide IPT will not be substantial. Community-wide IPT may play an important role in TB control in these settings, and its rollout should be accompanied by interventions to detect and treat drug-resistant disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Simple, rapid, and affordable tests are needed to detect drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the accuracy of microscopic-observation drug susceptibility (MODS) and thin layer agar (TLA) assays for rapid screening of patients at risk of drug-resistant tuberculosis.In accordance with protocols and methods recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working Group, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Biosis for reports published between January, 1990, and February, 2009. We included studies investigating detection of drug resistance in M tuberculosis with the MODS or TLA assay, and in which an accepted reference standard was used. Data extracted from the studies were combined by use of bivariate random-effects regression models and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves to estimate sensitivity and specificity for detection of resistance to specific drugs.We identified 12 studies, of which nine investigated the MODS assay and three investigated the TLA assay. For the MODS assay of rifampicin resistance, pooled estimates were 98·0\% (95\% CI 94·5-99·3) for sensitivity and 99·4\% (95·7-99·9) for specificity. For the MODS assay of isoniazid resistance with a 0·1 μg/mL cutoff, pooled sensitivity was 97·7\% (94·4-99·1) and pooled specificity was 95·8\% (88·1-98·6), but with a 0·4 μg/mL cutoff, sensitivity decreased to 90·0\% (84·5-93·7) and specificity increased to 98·6\% (96·9-99·4). All assessments of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance with the TLA assay yielded 100\% accuracy. Mean turnaround time was 9·9 days (95\% CI 4·1-15·8) for the MODS assay and 11·1 days (10·1-12·0) for the TLA assay.MODS and TLA assays are inexpensive, rapid alternatives to conventional methods for drug susceptibility testing of M tuberculosis. Our data and expert opinion informed WHO's recommendation for use of selected non-commercial drug susceptibility tests, including MODS, as an interim solution until capacity for genotypic or automated liquid culture drug susceptibility testing is developed.Stop TB Department of WHO.},

  Abstract                 = {In the first paper, the superiority of linear FM signals was shown in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and robustness to tissue attenuation. This second paper in the series of three papers on the application of coded excitation signals in medical ultrasound presents design methods of linear FM signals and mismatched filters, in order to meet the higher demands on resolution in ultrasound imaging. It is shown that for the small time-bandwidth (TB) products available in ultrasound, the rectangular spectrum approximation is not valid, which reduces the effectiveness of weighting. Additionally, the distant range sidelobes are associated with the ripples of the spectrum amplitude and, thus, cannot be removed by weighting. Ripple reduction is achieved through amplitude or phase predistortion of the transmitted signals. Mismatched filters are designed to efficiently use the available bandwidth and at the same time to be insensitive to the transducer's impulse response. With these techniques, temporal sidelobes are kept below 60 to 100 dB, image contrast is improved by reducing the energy within the sidelobe region, and axial resolution is preserved. The method is evaluated first for resolution performance and axial sidelobes through simulations with the program Field II. A coded excitation ultrasound imaging system based on a commercial scanner and a 4 MHz probe driven by coded sequences is presented and used for the clinical evaluation of the coded excitation/compression scheme. The clinical images show a significant improvement in penetration depth and contrast, while they preserve both axial and lateral resolution. At the maximum acquisition depth of 15 cm, there is an improvement of more than 10 dB in the signal-to-noise ratio of the images. The paper also presents acquired images, using complementary Golay codes, that show the deleterious effects of attenuation on binary codes when processed with a matched filter, also confirmed by presented simulated images.},

We identified 32 relevant publications (15 scientific and 17 non-scientific). Most of the selected studies dealt with transmission of tuberculosis. However, the relation between travel duration, proximity to the index case and environmental factors, such as ventilation, on disease transmission in public ground transport is poorly understood. Considering the difficulty and probably limited effectiveness of CT in ground transport, our results suggest that only exceptional circumstances would justify CT. This contrasts with the high level of attention CT in air travel seems to receive in international regulations and recommendations. We question whether the indication for CT should be revisited after a risk–benefit assessment that takes into account exposure in both ground and air transport.},

The first binding constant K1 of Na+ was not significantly dependent on channel models employed. With the two-identical-site model (Model I), K1 was 13.7 (+/- 1.4) molal-1 (in the activity basis) at 25 degrees C; when the binding of a third ion was included (Model II), it was 13.0 (+/- 2.0) molal-1.

For the state of double occupancy, T1 of bound 23Na (T 1B doub) was model dependent: 0.27 (+/- 0.01) and 0.4-0.6 ms for Models I and II. The correlation time tau c of bound 23Na was 2.2 (+/- 0.2) ns at 25 degrees C for single occupancy; tau c for double occupancy was not significantly different from this value. The estimated tau c was found to involve no appreciable contribution of the exchange of 23Na between the channel and the bulk solution. Thé quadrupole coupling constant chi was 1.0 (+/- 0.1) MHz for 23Na in single occupancy; chi for double occupancy was 0.9-1.4 MHz, depending on models. A lower bound of the average quadrupole coupling constant chi alpha was 0.13-0.26 MHz at 25 degrees C for 23Na in single occupancy; this value represents a rough approximation of chi alpha at this temperature. An argument based on the estimated chi alpha and the known conformation of the gramicidin channel suggests that the binding site is a small domain near the channel end. Within the framework of Model I, Tb was faster than Tljn; this inequality was attributed to an increased chi in the presence ofa second cation, which was not explained in terms of electrostatic interactions between bound cations, implying a conformation change upon binding of cations.},

  Abstract                 = {Identifying how social determinants of health (SDH) influence the burden of disease in communities and populations is critically important to determine how to target public health interventions and move toward health equity. A holistic approach to disease prevention involves understanding the combined effects of individual, social, health system, and environmental determinants on geographic area-based disease burden. Using 2006-2008 gonorrhea surveillance data from the National Notifiable Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance and SDH variables from the American Community Survey, we calculated the diagnosis rate for each geographic area and analyzed the associations between those rates and the SDH and demographic variables. The estimated product moment correlation (PMC) between gonorrhea rate and SDH variables ranged from 0.11 to 0.83. Proportions of the population that were black, of minority race/ethnicity, and unmarried, were each strongly correlated with gonorrhea diagnosis rates. The population density, female proportion, and proportion below the poverty level were moderately correlated with gonorrhea diagnosis rate. To better understand relationships among SDH, demographic variables, and gonorrhea diagnosis rates, more geographic area-based estimates of additional variables are required. With the availability of more SDH variables and methods that distinguish linear from non-linear associations, geographic area-based analysis of disease incidence and SDH can add value to public health prevention and control programs.},

To determine if transmission had occurred, passengers and crew were notified of the potential exposure and instructed to undergo a tuberculin skin test (TST). Of the 240 persons who completed screening, 4 (2\%) had a documented TST conversion (increase in induration of > or = 10 mm between successive TSTs), 11 (5\%) had a single positive TST (> or = 10 mm), and 225 (94\%) had a negative TST (< 10 mm). For two persons who underwent conversion, no other risk factors for a conversion were identified other than exposure to the ill passenger during train and/or bus travel. These findings support limited transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from a potentially highly infectious passenger to other persons during extended train and bus travel.},

  Abstract                 = {The object of the study was to explain the differences in bilirubin level in various experimental jaundice models. The Bil constituents in conjugated hyperbilirubinemic dog models were identified. Total Bil was measured using the Jendrassik and Grof method and direct spectrophotometry. Conjugated and unconjugated Bil were measured using the Weber-Schalm extraction method. Bilirubin covalently bound to albumin was measured indirectly from the total Bil and the non-CBBA fraction. The non-CBBA was estimated either as the sum of the CB and UCB concentrations determined by the W-S method or as the nonprecipitated fraction after deproteinization with ammonium sulfate-saturated ethanol when using DS. The TB, CB, UCB, and CBBA levels were compared in two hyperbilirubinemic dog models: chronic bile duct ligation (CBDL) and internal choledochocaval anastomosis (CDCA). The mean TB in internal CDCA (16.5 +/- 3.67 mg\%) was significantly higher than in CBDL (3.4 +/- 1.75 mg\%). Most of the serum Bil in these two models was conjugated, 13.4 +/- 2.24 and 3.2 +/- 1.7 mg\%, respectively. No CBBA was found in the CBDL or in the partially obstructed internal-CDCA dogs. The TB in an external-CDCA model was essentially similar to the internal-CDCA model. The indirect Bil level in the external-CDCA model was six to seven times higher than the UCB level, and the CBBA level varied between 30 and 80\% of the TB. Up to 50\% CBBA was found also in patients with intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis. The findings indicate that, unlike the commonly assumed hypothesis, the serum TB level in the CDCA models, which was higher than in the CBCL one, is not due to high UCB levels. Rather, hyperbilirubinemia in the external-CDCA model is due to increased levels of CBBA or, perhaps, to variations in the amount and/or composition of CB entering the blood and cleared by the kidney.},

However, in countries in which the incidence of tuberculosis is high, contact investigation is not commonly done. Increasing concerns about the failure to meet case-detection targets and about the spread of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis have prompted a reassessment of the potential benefits of contact investigation. We did a systematic review to determine the yield of household contact investigation. The yield for all tuberculosis (bacteriologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed) was 4.5\% (95\% CI 4.3-4.8, I(2)=95.5\%) of contacts investigated; for cases with bacteriological confirmation the yield was 2.3\% (95\% CI 2.1-2.5, I(2)=96.6\%). Latent tuberculosis infection was found in 51.4\% (95\% CI 50.6-52.2, I(2)=99.4\%) of contacts investigated. The substantial heterogeneity in all analyses indicated high variability among studies that was not accounted for by subgroup analyses. These results suggest that contact investigation merits serious consideration as a means to improve early case detection and decrease transmission of M tuberculosis in high-incidence areas.},

Although direct comparisons of these studies are impossible, some insights can be gained: MDR-TB can and should be addressed therapeutically in resource-poor settings; starting of treatment early is crucial; aggressive treatment regimens and high-end dosing are recommended given the lower potency of second-line antituberculosis drugs; and strategies to improve treatment adherence, such as directly observed therapy, should be used. Opportunities to treat MDR-TB in developing countries are now possible through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, and the Green Light Committee for Access to Second-line Anti-tuberculosis Drugs. As treatment of MDR-TB becomes increasingly available in resource-poor areas, where it is needed most, further clinical and operational research is urgently needed to guide clinicians in the management of this disease.},

A total of 187 HIV/TB deaths were observed among 16,844 children aged 1-5 years coming from 8,863 households. In this paper we used Bayesian models to assess risk factors for child HIV/TB mortality taking into account the presence of spatial correlation. Bayesian zero inflated spatiotemporal models were able to detect hidden patterns within the data. Our main finding was that maternal orphans experienced a threefold greater risk of HIV/TB death compared to those with living mothers (AHR=2.93, 95\% CI[1.29;6.93]). Risk factor analyses which adjust for person, place and time provide evidence for policy makers that includes a spatial distribution of risk. Child survival is dependent on the mother's survival; hence programs that promote maternal survival are critical.},

  Abstract                 = {Yellow fever (YF) is still a major public heath problem, particularly in Africa, despite the availability of a very efficacious vaccine. The World Health Organization estimates that there are 200,000 cases of YF annually, including 30,000 deaths, of which over 90\% occur in Africa. In the past 15 years, the number of YF cases has increased tremendously, with most of the YF activity in West Africa. This increase in YF activity is in part due to a breakdown in YF vaccination and mosquito control programs. Five genotypes of YF virus have been found in Africa, and each genotype circulates in a distinct geographical region. West Africa genotype I, found in Nigeria and surrounding areas, is associated with frequent epidemics, whereas the three genotypes in East and Central Africa are in regions where YF outbreaks are rare. Other factors, including genetic and behavioral variation among vector species, are also thought to play a role in the epidemiology of YF in Africa.},

  Abstract                 = {Ongoing transmission and re-infection, primarily in congregate settings, is a key factor fueling the global multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) epidemic, especially in association with the human immunodeficiency virus. Even as efforts to broadly implement conventional TB transmission control measures begin, current strategies may be incompletely effective under the overcrowded conditions extant in high-burden, resource-limited settings. Longstanding evidence suggesting that TB patients on effective therapy rapidly become non-infectious and that unsuspected, untreated TB cases account for the most transmission makes a strong case for the implementation of rapid point-of-care diagnostics coupled with fully supervised effective treatment. Among the most important decisions affecting transmission, the choice of an MDR-TB treatment model that includes community-based treatment may offer important advantages over hospital or clinic-based care, not only in cost and effectiveness, but also in transmission control. In the community, too, rapid identification of infectious cases, especially drug-resistant cases, followed by effective, fully supervised treatment, is critical to stopping transmission. Among the conventional interventions available, we present a simple triage and separation strategy, point out that separation is intimately linked to the design and engineering of clinical space and call attention to the pros and cons of natural ventilation, simple mechanical ventilation systems, germicidal ultraviolet air disinfection, fit-tested respirators on health care workers and short-term use of masks on patients before treatment is initiated.},

  Abstract                 = {Mass immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) was begun in the United States in 1963, and the least natural outbreak of poliomyelitis occurred in 1972. Since immunization programs fail to reach the total population, eradication has been achieved in the presence of a residual susceptible population of at least 5\% (2-5 million children under the age of 15 years). It is proposed that the fade-out of wild polioviruses is explained by their disappearance during the winter, a low point in the yearly cycle of the virus. In the post-eradication era, the continued presence of millions of susceptible children and adults presents a constant potential hazard. Every effort should be made to maintain maximal levels of immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine and to prevent the reintroduction of wild polioviruses into the United States.Drawing largely upon recent discussions, this summary addresses 2 main points: how the US succeeded in eradicating poliovirus; and the relative roles of inactivated (IPV) and attenuated (OPV) poliovirus vaccine in eradication. Figure 1, which gives the reported cases of paralytic poliomyelitis in the US over the 1951-77 period, shows that the incidence dropped from 10,000-20,000 cases/year in the early 1950s to a current level of around 10 cases/year. Figure 2, which presents evidence for the 1970-78 period, indicates that cases occurring in the last decade have been either vaccine-associated or imported. There are 2 alternative explanations for the dramatic and largely unpredicted disappearance of poliomyelitis: either all susceptibles have been immunized; or wild virus has been eradicated. National health surveys suggest that 5-10\% of the population under age 14 has not received OPV. This does not represent a true estimate of the susceptible population, for OPV spreads to contacts of recipients who may be immunized in this way. Even though the available data fail to provide a precise estimate, they suggest that there is a residual susceptible population in the US that may be conservatively estimated to include at least 5-10\% of children under age 14. This observation supports the inference that wild poliovirus has been eradicated in the US and raises another question, i.e., how was poliomyelitis eradicated while retaining a residual population of susceptibles. This question has not been investigated adequately. A major factor in eradication is seasonality. Table 2 presents a hypothetical reconstruction of the preimmunization situation in a population of 1 million. With an estimated 20,000 infections/year, seasonality was such at the trough period only 1/1000 of the total infections for the year would occur in 1 generation period, i.e., 20 infections. Following widespread use of OPV, there were regional fadeouts during trough periods, but unlike the situation with measles, there was no reintroduction of virus into those areas where fadeout had occurred. In sum, a difference in the probability of transmission over long distances may be crucial in explaining the divergent impact of measles and poliomyelitis vaccines. To consider poliovirus vaccines in the context of poliomyelitis eradication, Figure 5 and Table 6 review some of the advantages and disadvantages of the 2 vaccines.},

We assume that the present status of TB and the emergence of drug-resistant TB in Thailand are the consequence of past epidemics. Control strategies in the model are defined by specifying the value of the effective treatment rate (baseline value = 0.74) and the relative treatment efficacy (baseline value = 0.84). It is predicted that the total number of new TB cases would continue to decrease at the current level of intervention. Although a dramatic decline in the incidence rate of drug-sensitive cases is expected, drug-resistant cases are predicted to increase gradually, so that more than half of the TB strains would not be drug-sensitive after 2020. The prediction is not greatly altered by improving the interventions. They could, however, delay the emergence of drug-resistant strains for a few years. Our study demonstrates it would be impossible to avoid the continued emergence of drug-resistant TB in the future. It is pointed out that there are urgent needs to ensure adequate supervision and monitoring, to insure treatment of 100\% of the targeted population with Directly Observed Therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite an increase in global measles vaccine coverage from under 20\% in 1980 to around 80\% in 1990, measles remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality world-wide. This paper addresses a number of issues relating to efforts to control measles, namely, (i) at the global level, how might we assess the impact of measles vaccination on the incidence of infection and associated disease, and, (ii), at the strategic level, how can we utilise an understanding of the transmission dynamics of childhood viral infections to aid the design of optimal immunisation programmes? Based on WHO vaccine coverage data, and organising countries according to similarities in demographic and epidemiological parameters, an age-structured model of measles transmission is used to capture the non-linear dynamics of infection and mass vaccination and to generate projections of the impact of measles immunization world-wide. The results provide a crude indication of the percentage reduction in measles cases by year 2000 (compared with no immunization) and suggest an approximately 70\% reduction in cases over all ages, and 77\% reduction in cases under 5 years (where there is the greatest risk of case fatality); these suggest that WHO targets for 1995 are unlikely to be achieved. In the second part of the paper, examples are given to illustrate the usefulness of a modelling approach in evaluating measles immunization policy. The introduction of MMR vaccine in the UK in 1988 has resulted in measles incidence falling to an all time low and attention has turned to the requirements of elimination. A realistic age structured model, validated using extensive serological data, is used to compare the merits of single or two dose strategies. Based upon recent estimates of vaccine efficacy (90\%) and coverage (92\% by end of second year of life) it is suggested that a two-dose policy with a pre-school second dose given irrespective of vaccine history is required to prevent the build up of susceptibles to epidemic proportions in the longer term. In a second example, prompted by the success of the campaign approach to polio and measles elimination in Central and South America, simple models are used to explore and quantify the process by which pulse vaccination programmes (i.e. repeated application across a wide age range) act to control transmission.},

  Abstract                 = {Ligand L, based on two do3a moieties linked by the methylene groups of 6,6'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine, was synthesized and characterized. The addition of Ln salts to an aqueous solution of L (0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) led to the successive formation of [LnL] and [Ln(2)L] complexes, as evidenced by UV/Vis and fluorescence titration experiments. Homodinuclear [Ln(2)L] complexes (Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb, Yb, and Lu) were prepared and characterized. The (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra of the Lu and Yb complexes in D(2)O solution (pD = 7.0) showed C(1) symmetry of these species in solution, pointing to two different chemical environments for the two lanthanide cations. The analysis of the chemical shifts of the Yb complex indicated that the two coordination sites present square antiprismatic (SAP) coordination environments around the metal ions. The spectroscopic properties of the [Tb(2)L] complex upon ligand excitation revealed conventional behavior with τ(H2O) = 2.05(1) ms and ϕ(H2O) = 51\%, except for the calculation of the hydration number obtained from the luminescent lifetimes in H(2)O and D(2)O, which pointed to a non-integer value of 0.6 water molecules per Tb(III) ion. In contrast, the Eu complex revealed surprising features such as: 1) the presence of two and up to five components in the (5)D(0)→(7)F(0) and (5)D(0)→(7)F(1) emission bands, respectively; 2) marked differences between the normalized spectra obtained in H(2)O and D(2)O solutions; and 3) unconventional temporal evolution of the luminescence intensity at certain wavelengths, the intensity profile first displaying a rising step before the occurrence of the expected decay. Additional spectroscopic experiments performed on [Gd(2-x)Eu(x)L] complexes (x = 0.1 and 1.9) confirmed the presence of two distinct Eu sites with hydration numbers of 0 (site I) and 2 (site II), and showed that the unconventional temporal evolution of the emission intensity is the result of an unprecedented intramolecular Eu-to-Eu energy-transfer process. A mathematical model was developed to interpret the experimental data, leading to energy-transfer rates of 0.98 ms(-1) for the transfer from the site with q=0 to that with q=2 and vice versa. Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed at the B3LYP level were used to investigate the conformation of the complex in solution, and to estimate the intermetallic distance, which provided Förster radii (R(0)) values of 8.1 Å for the energy transfer from site I to site II, and 6.8 Å for the reverse energy transfer. These results represent the first evidence of an intramolecular energy-transfer equilibrium between two identical lanthanide cations within a discrete molecular complex in solution.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: In France, there was a reluctance to accept vaccination against the A/H1N1 pandemic influenza virus despite government recommendation and investment in the vaccine programme. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined the willingness of different populations to accept A/H1N1 vaccination (i) in a French hospital among 3315 employees immunized either by in-house medical personnel or mobile teams of MDs and (ii) in a shelter housing 250 homeless persons. Google was used to assess the volume of enquiries concerning incidence of influenza. We analyzed the information on vaccination provided by Google, the website of the major French newspapers, and PubMed. Two trust Surveys were used to assess public opinion on the trustworthiness of people in different professions. Paramedics were significantly more reluctant to accept immunisation than qualified medical staff. Acceptance was significantly increased when recommended directly by MDs. Anecdotal cases of directly observed severe infections were followed by enhanced acceptance of paramedical staff. Scientific literature was significantly more in favour of vaccination than Google and French newspaper websites. In the case of the newspaper websites, information correlated with their recognised political reputations, although they would presumably claim independence from political bias. The Trust Surveys showed that politicians were highly dis-trusted in contrast with doctors and pharmacists who were considered much more trustworthy. CONCLUSIONS: The low uptake of the vaccine could reflect failure to convey high quality medical information and advice relating to the benefits of being vaccinated. We believe that the media and internet contributed to this problem by raising concerns within the general population and that failure to involve GPs in the control programme may have been a mistake. GPs are highly regarded by the public and can provide face-to-face professional advice and information. The top-down strategy of vaccine programme management and information delivered by the Ministry of Health could have aggravated the problem, because the general population does not always trust politicians.},

  Abstract                 = {Treatment of infections due to extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii often involves the use of antimicrobial agents in combination. Various combinations of agents have been proposed, with colistin serving as the backbone in many of them. Recent data suggest that glycopeptides, in particular vancomycin, may have unique activity against laboratory-adapted and clinical strains of A. baumannii, alone and in combination with colistin. The aim of the present study was to test this approach against three unique colistin-resistant A. baumannii clinical strains using combinations of vancomycin (VAN), colistin (COL), and doripenem (DOR). All three strains possessed the signature phosphoethanolamine modification of the lipid A moiety associated with colistin resistance and unique amino acid changes in the PmrAB two-component signal transduction system not observed in colistin-susceptible strains. In checkerboard assays, synergy (defined as a fractional inhibitory concentration index [FICI] of ≤ 0.5) was observed between COL and VAN for all three strains tested and between COL and DOR in two strains. In time-kill assays, the combinations of COL-DOR, COL-VAN, and COL-DOR-VAN resulted in complete killing of colistin-resistant A. baumannii in 1, 2, and all 3 strains, respectively. In the Galleria mellonella moth model of infection, the combinations of DOR-VAN and COL-DOR-VAN led to significantly increased survival of the larvae, compared with other combinations and monotherapy. These findings suggest that regimens containing vancomycin may confer therapeutic benefit for infection due to colistin-resistant A. baumannii.},

  Abstract                 = {CDC and ACET in U.S.A. reported that novel vaccines instead of BCG are required for the protection against infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis worldwide. However, no novel vaccine for clinical use has not yet been developed in the world including U.S.A. and Europe. We have developed a novel tuberculosis (TB) vaccine; a combination of the DNA vaccines expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (HSP65) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-envelope and -liposome (HSP65+IL-12/HVJ). This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse compared to the BCG vaccine on the basis of C.F.U of number of TB, survival, an induction of the CD8 positive CTL activity and improvement of the histopathological tuberculosis lesions. This vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) in murine models. Furthermore, we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis. This novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than BCG based upon the assessment of mortality, the ESR, body weight, chest X-ray findings and immune responses. Furthermore, the BCG priming and HSP65+IL-12/HVJ vaccine (booster) by the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkey (100\% survival). Furthermore, this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy (100\% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys. These data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful against Mycobacterium tuberculosis including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical trials. The review also provides recent advances of the precise studies of induction of immunity including CD8 positive cytotoxic T cells and effector molecules such as granulysin by these vaccines, against multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and extremely drug resistant tuberculosis.},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (M.TB) is a big problem in the world. We have developed novel TB therapeutic vaccines.DNA vaccine expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 and IL-12 was delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-envelope. M. TB, MDR-TB or extremenly drug resistant (XDR-TB) was injected i.v. into DBA/1 mice, and treated with the vaccine three times. This HVJ-E/Hsp65DNA+IL-12DNA vaccine provided strong therapeutic efficacy against MDR-TB and XDR-TB (prolongation of survival time and the decrease in the number of TB) in mice. Therapeutic effect of this vaccine on TB infection was also demonstrated in chronic TB infection murine model using aerosol infection intratracheally. On the other hand, granulysin protein produced from CTL has lethal activity against TB. Granulysin protein vaccine also exerted strong therapeutic effect. Furthermore, we extended our studies to monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human TB. Hsp65DNA+IL-12 DNA vaccine exerted strong therapeutic efficacy (100\% survival and augmentation of immune responses) in the TB-infected monkeys. In contrast, the survival of the saline control group was 60\% at 16 week post-challenge. HVJ-Envelope/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA vaccine increased the body weight of TB-infected monkeys, improved the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and augmentated the immune responses (proliferation of PBL and IL-2 production). The enhancement of IL-2 production from monkeys treated with this vaccine was correlated with the therapeutic efficacy of the vaccine. Conclusion: These data indicate that novel vaccines might be useful against TB including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most successful bacterial parasites of humans, infecting over one-third of the population of the world as latent infection without clinical manifestations. Over 8.8 million new cases and nearly 2 million deaths by tuberculosis (TB) occur annually. TB poses a significant health threat to the world population. The goal of this symposium is to open new avenues for combating tuberculosis. The speakers have presented their data and provided control strategies against tuberculosis and pulmonary disease due to M. avium complex (MAC) from aspects of molecular epidemiology, pathogenesis, serodiagnosis, new anti-TB drugs, and vaccine development. Drs. Maeda and Murase have reported that the 12-locus VNTR analysis is very useful for molecular epidemiology of M. tuberculosis strains isolated in Japan better than IS6110-RFLP and suggested that the analysis is powerful tool for the molecular epidemiology. Drs. Matsumoto and Kobayashi have discovered a protein, mycobacterial DNA-binding protein 1 (MDPl), overproduced in dormant M. tuberculosis that plays key roles in latent/ persistent infection, disease progression, and host protection. They have concluded that MDP1 may be a possible target for anti-tuberculosis drugs and vaccines. Drs. Kitada and Maekura have developed serodiagnosis of MAC disease based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) by detecting anti-glycopeptidolipid (GPL) antibody in sera of human patients. GPL is specific for MAC. The EIA is a simple, rapid and accurate measure with high sensitivity and specificity. The levels of antibody also reflect disease activity. A large-scale clinical multicenter study is currently in progress. Dr. Makoto Matsumoto has discovered an innovative new anti-TB drug, OPC-67683 that is a derivative of nitroimidazole compounds. OPC-67683 inhibited mycolic acid synthesis and exerted potent antimycobacterial activity, including multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis. Multidrug therapy using OPC-67683 could also shorten the course of chemotherapy. The drug is clearly the most promising new anti-TB agent that has been identified in many years. Dr. Okada has presented the vaccine candidates for TB, such as HVJ-liposome/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA and HVJ-envelope/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA. The candidates exhibited an excellent protective efficacy in mice compared to current BCG vaccine, and improved histopathologic lesions induced by M. tuberculosis infection. The candidates also exerted the therapeutic effect in mice against both drugsusceptible TB and extensively drug-resistant TB. Using the cynomolgus monkey model (similar to human TB), HVJ-liposome/ HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA provided higher protective efficacy than BCG assessed by mortality. The combination of BCG and HVJ-liposome/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA by the prime-booster procedure could lead to a synergistic effect of 100\% survival in infected monkeys. These data suggest that the novel DNA vaccine is a possible candidate for human clinical trials. This symposium has highlighted new advances in our understanding of molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of "Mycobacteriology" and development of new serodiagnostics, anti-TB drugs, and vaccines. 1. The establishment of the quick genotyping method for TB in Japan using the variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR): Shinji MAEDA, Yoshiro MURASE (Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association) The 12-locus VNTR analysis that we have established optimally for Mycobacteriun tuberculosis in Japan was superior to the proposed 15-locus VNTR method in European countries. The discriminatory power of our system was also higher than that of IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In future, we will investigate the stability of copy number in each locus by using the strains that suspected epidemiological links in contact investigations. 2. A virulence factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which contributes to persistent infection, reactivation, and host protection: Sohkichi MATSUMOTO (Department of Host Defense, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine), Kazuo KOBAYASHI (Department of Immunology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases) Majority of adult tuberculosis is caused by reactivation of previously implanted Mycobacterium tuberculosis. During latent infection, some bacilli are in dormant state, which confers some survival advantage to not only bacteria but also the host. We presented that a protein overproduced in dormant M. tuberculosis plays key roles in persistent infection, disease progression, and host protection. We also presented utility of this protein, such as development of anti-tuberculosis drug and vaccine. 3. Serodiagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease by enzyme immunoassay using glycopeptidolipid antigen: Seigo KITADA, Ryoji MAEKURA (Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization National Toneyama Hospital) The diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) and/or its discrimination from pulmonary tuberculosis is sometimes complicated and time consuming. We have developed serological test by enzyme immunoassay that detect serum antibody to glycopeptidolipid antigen. The serodiagnosis is useful for the rapid diagnosis of MAC-PD and differential diagnosis from pulmonary TB. The antibody levels reflected the disease activity including radiographic severity. 4. A novel antituberculous agent, OPC-67683: Research and development: Makoto MATSUMOTO (Microbiological Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) We initiated a program to screen new antituberculous agents that have potential to shorten the total duration of treatment, provide improved efficacy against MDR-TB, be useful in treating HIV co-infected patients, and target latent TB infections. Our efforts led to the discovery of OPC-67683, a novel oxazo-imidazole derivative with a distinctive characteristic as a subclass mycolic acid inhibitor. Our evaluation studies confirmed OPC-67683 to possess potent in vitro and in vivo antituberculous activity, suggesting potential usefulness in alleviating the current TB problems. 5. The development of novel vaccines against M. tuberculosis: Masaji OKADA (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center) We have developed a novel tuberculosis (TB) vaccine (HVJ-liposome/ or HVJ-envelope/HSP65 DNA+ IL-12 DNA). The vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse compared to BCG vaccine, and improved the histopathological tuberculosis lesions. This vaccine also exerted therapeutic effect in vivo against XDR-TB as well as drug-sensitive TB in mice. Furthermore, by using the cynomolgus monkey (similar to human tuberculosis), this novel vaccine provided higher protective efficacy (mortality) than BCG mortality. Furthermore, the combination of HSP65+IL-12/HVJ and BCG by the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkey (100\% survival). These data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful against TB for human clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly around the world, largely because persons infected with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) traveled on aircraft to distant cities. Although many infected persons traveled on commercial aircraft, the risk, if any, of in-flight transmission is unknown.We attempted to interview passengers and crew members at least 10 days after they had taken one of three flights that transported a patient or patients with SARS. All index patients met the criteria of the World Health Organization for a probable case of SARS, and index or secondary cases were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or serologic testing.After one flight carrying a symptomatic person and 119 other persons, laboratory-confirmed SARS developed in 16 persons, 2 others were given diagnoses of probable SARS, and 4 were reported to have SARS but could not be interviewed. Among the 22 persons with illness, the mean time from the flight to the onset of symptoms was four days (range, two to eight), and there were no recognized exposures to patients with SARS before or after the flight. Illness in passengers was related to the physical proximity to the index patient, with illness reported in 8 of the 23 persons who were seated in the three rows in front of the index patient, as compared with 10 of the 88 persons who were seated elsewhere (relative risk, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 6.9). In contrast, another flight carrying four symptomatic persons resulted in transmission to at most one other person, and no illness was documented in passengers on the flight that carried a person who had presymptomatic SARS.Transmission of SARS may occur on an aircraft when infected persons fly during the symptomatic phase of illness. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission are warranted.},

  Abstract                 = {Poliomyelitis (polio) still remains a great public health problem in developing countries. A study of the distribution of 2205 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis seen in Ibadan City, Nigeria over a 15-year period shows that the incidence of polio is much higher in the central core area of the city where sanitary conditions are poor, whereas in the peripheral parts of the city, where environmental sanitation is better, the incidence of polio is lower. A total of 88.4\% of the cases originated from the central core area whereas only 11.6\% were from the peripheral area. The polio victims from the peripheral area were, however, disproportionately older than the victims from the core area. It is suggested that in the central core area of Ibadan, where children with the highest risk of polio paralysis reside, immunization against polio should be started much earlier, preferably at birth, while children in the peripheral area who may receive their immunization at a later age (6 months and above) will require booster doses at age 15-18 months and at 5 years of age.},

  Abstract                 = {The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of liver disease and liver cancer worldwide according to the World Health Organization. Following acute HBV infection, 1-5\% of infected healthy adults and up to 90\% of infected infants become chronic carriers and have an increased risk of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the reduction in acute hepatitis B incidence and the universal vaccination programme in preadolescents in Catalonia (Spain), taking population changes into account, and to construct a model to forecast the future incidence of cases that permits the best preventive strategy to be adopted.Reported acute hepatitis B incidence in Catalonia according to age, gender, vaccination coverage, percentage of immigrants and the year of report of cases was analysed. A statistical analysis was made using three models: generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson or negative binomial distribution and a generalized additive model (GAM).The higher the vaccination coverage, the lower the reported incidence of hepatitis B (p <0.01). In groups with vaccination coverage > 70\%, the reduction in incidence was 2-fold higher than in groups with a coverage <70\% (p <0.01). The increase in incidence was significantly-higher in groups with a high percentage of immigrants and more than 15\% (p <0.01) in immigrant males of working age (19-49 years).The results of the adjusted models in this study confirm that the global incidence of hepatitis B has declined in Catalonia after the introduction of the universal preadolescent vaccination programme, but the incidence increased in male immigrants of working age. Given the potential severity of hepatitis B for the health of individuals and for the community, universal vaccination programmes should continue and programmes in risk groups, especially immigrants, should be strengthened.},

This report describes the prevalence of resistance to four first-line drugs in 35 countries participating in the World Health Organization-International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance between 1994 and 1997.The data are from cross-sectional surveys and surveillance reports. Participating countries followed guidelines to ensure the use of representative samples, accurate histories of treatment, standardized laboratory methods, and common definitions. A network of reference laboratories provided quality assurance. The median number of patients studied in each country or region was 555 (range, 59 to 14,344).Among patients with no prior treatment, a median of 9.9 percent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were resistant to at least one drug (range, 2 to 41 percent); resistance to isoniazid (7.3 percent) or streptomycin (6.5 percent) was more common than resistance to rifampin (1.8 percent) or ethambutol (1.0 percent). The prevalence of primary multidrug resistance was 1.4 percent (range, 0 to 14.4 percent). Among patients with histories of treatment for one month or more [corrected], the prevalence of resistance to any of the four drugs was 36.0 percent (range, 5.3 to 100 percent), and the prevalence of multidrug resistance was 13 percent (range, 0 to 54 percent). The overall prevalences were 12.6 percent for resistance to any of the four drugs [corrected] (range, 2.3 to 42.4 percent) and 2.2 percent for multidrug resistance (range, 0 to 22.1 percent). Particularly high prevalences of multidrug resistance were found in the former Soviet Union, Asia, the Dominican Republic, and Argentina.Resistance to antituberculosis drugs was found in all 35 countries and regions surveyed, suggesting that it is a global problem.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of the study was to optimize and characterize high therapeutic payload large respirable powders prepared by spray-drying technique for maximum fine particle fraction with minimum quantities of excipients. Influence of formulation components was optimized by a three-factor, five-level central composite design having different proportions of L-leucine (X1), tobramycin sulfate (X2), and poloxamer-188 (X3) as the independent variables and fine particle fraction as a response variable (Y). Large respirable powders were characterized for particle size, size distribution, moisture, crystallinity, and morphology. In vitro aerosol performance of powders was determined by an eight-stage Andersen cascade impactor using the Rotahaler. Mathematical model elucidated for Y was Y = 56.2068 + 5.7481 X1 - 3.0531 X2 + 0.8468 X3 + 1.1737 X1 X2 - 0.5012 X1 X3 - 0.7412 X2 X3 - 0.7149 X1(2) - 1.9212 X2(2) - 1.6187X3(2). The component of greatest influence on product performance (response variable) was found to be L-leucine. Lack of fit was not significant (p = 0.08), and regression equation predicted response for Y was in reasonably good agreement with experimental values (p = 0.01; R2 = 0.92). The optimal model predicted with a fine particle fraction of 62.8 +/- 2.6\% with X1, X2, X3 levels of 20, 45.71, and 5.51 respectively. Large respirable powders with TB load of 45.7\% w/w were prepared; they had smooth surface texture, dimpled spherical shape, roundness value close to 1(1.048 +/- 0.032) and were found to possess bulk tap densities of 0.04 g/cc, geometric particle sizes of 6-7 micro m, and emitted dose of 92\%. The results of the studies suggest that in vitro aerosol performance was affected significantly by small and deliberate change of specific formulation components and its proportions. It may be concluded that appropriate type and proportion of excipients is necessary to obtain maximum fine particle fraction of large respirable powders containing high therapeutic payloads.},

The Wells-Riley model was applied to predict transmission rates.The results suggested that poor ventilation and well-mixed air led to equal exposure of staff members to airborne TB bacilli. The model's prediction of attack rate (42\%) supported the actual number of infections that occurred (50\%).This study supports the use of environmental assessment and modelling as a tool for public health practitioners to determine the extent of TB exposure and to inform TB screening strategies. CO(2) and airborne particle profiles, both measured via a handheld device, provide the greatest practicality and amount of information that public health practitioners can use. Further studies will validate the level of screening required related to these measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Thermal hysteresis may be used to quantify and characterize the amount of heat stress an animal experiences. Heat stress studies of farm animals suggest that above a certain threshold body temperature (Tb) is driven by ambient temperature (Ta). Patterns in the Tb-Ta phase diagram indicate the presence of hysteresis. When hysteresis is present, there are two values for Tb depending on whether Ta is increasing or decreasing. A theoretical delay-relay model is proposed to illustrate the hysteretic dynamics of the Tb-Ta relationship when Ta is cyclic. Two types of hysteresis, transitional and thermal, are identified. Thermal hysteresis becomes prominent when Ta forces Tb into an elliptical limit cycle. The area of the ellipse is an indication of the animal's heat load. Also, the resulting Tb-Ta pattern depends on the delay (or lag) between Tb and Ta. The delay suggests possible levels of heat stress. A greater delay between Tb and Ta indicates more time is needed to dissipate the heat load, implying the animal is suffering more heat stress. For a given Ta, the Tb on the decreasing (recovery) path is always higher than the Tb on the increasing (challenge) path. Essentially, the animal requires more energy to dissipate heat than to absorb it.},

This retrospective cohort study assessed predictors of completion of LTBI treatment among patients seen at an urban United States TB clinic in 1998.A retrospective cohort study of acceptance and completion of LTBI treatment among patients first seen in a TB clinic in 1998 was performed.Of 2621 persons with a positive tuberculosis skin test (TST), 1723 were offered treatment and 1572 (91.2\%) accepted. Of the 1572 who accepted, treatment was completed by 607 (38.6\%). Of those persons who failed to complete treatment, 517/965 (54\%) dropped out before the end of the first month of the course. Among 1375 persons under 35 years of age who initiated LTBI treatment, failure to complete was associated with birth in Haiti (OR=2.17, CI(95\%) 1.49-3.17) or the Dominican Republic (OR=1.93, CI(95\%) 1.08-3.43).These results suggest that country-specific cultural and behavioral factors may contribute to failure to complete LTBI treatment, and that interventions to increase completion should focus on the first month after initiation.},

  Abstract                 = {The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa has increased over the past decade and a significant rise in these isolates in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) has been observed. However, the impact of MDR on VAP outcome has not been analysed in depth. We investigated the risk factors for early and crude mortality in a retrospective study of microbiologically and clinically documented VAP. Ninety-one VAP episodes in 83 patients were included, 31 caused by susceptible P. aeruginosa and 60 by MDR strains, of which 42 (70 \%) were extensively drug-resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa. Thirteen episodes concomitantly presented P. aeruginosa bacteraemia, in seven of which the origin was the respiratory tract. Whereas susceptible P. aeruginosa episodes were more likely than MDR episodes to receive adequate empirical (68 \% vs. 30 \%; p < 0.001) and definitive antimicrobial therapy (96 \% vs. 50 \%; p < 0.001), susceptible P. aeruginosa VAP presented a trend towards early mortality (29 \% vs. 15 \%; p = 0.06). A logistic regression model with early mortality as the dependent variable identified multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [odds ratio (OR) 10.4; 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-63.5; p = 0.01] and inadequate antibiotic therapy (OR 4.27; 95 \% CI 0.98-18.4; p = 0.052) as independent risk factors for early mortality. A similar analysis identified MODS (OR 4.31; 95 \% CI 1.14-16.2; p = 0.03) as the only independent predictor of crude mortality. The severity of acute illness clinical presentation was the main predictor of mortality. Despite adequate antibiotic therapy, susceptible P. aeruginosa seems to cause major early mortality. Although adequate therapy is essential to treat VAP, the severity of acute illness is a more important factor than drug resistance.},

  Abstract                 = {Several studies have suggested that resistance determinants usually reduce virulence. However, their contribution to decrease bloodstream infections is unclear. Our aim was to identify risk factors of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) bacteremia and to assess the prevalence of XDR-PA bacteremia. A retrospective study of PA bloodstream infections in our patient population with at least one clinical sample isolate due to PA (2006-2007) was carried out. A total of 2,131 patients with PA clinical samples were detected. Among 1,657 patients with susceptible-PA isolates, 95 developed PA-susceptible bacteremia. Concomitantly, among 474 patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR)-PA isolates, 265 with XDR-PA, and 209 with non-XDR MDR-PA, 43 developed XDR-PA bacteremia and 13 non-XDR MDR-PA bacteremia, respectively. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed the clonal nature of the two predominant XDR-PA phenotypes and genetic heterogeneity in non-XDR MDR-PA phenotypes. The proportion of XDR-PA bacteremia was higher than the proportion of bacteremia in the susceptible-PA population (16 \% vs. 6 \%; p < 0.001). A logistic regression model identified prior exposure to fluoroquinolones [odds ratio (OR) 2.80; 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 7.70] as the independent variable associated with XDR-PA bacteremia. Our study suggests that XDR-PA strains have a greater ability to develop bacteremia. It remains unclear as to whether this invasive capacity depends on clonal traits or on other virulence determinants.},

Here, in an attempt to further elucidate the dynamics of the acquisition of resistance to second-line drugs and investigate an eventual role for eis promoter mutations in aminoglycoside resistance, we have studied a set of multidrug-resistant (MDR)/XDR-TB isolates circulating in Lisbon, Portugal.Forty-four MDR-TB or XDR-TB isolates were genotyped and screened for mutations in genes associated with second-line drug resistance, namely tlyA, gyrA, rrs and eis.The most prevalent mutations found in each gene were Ins755GT in tlyA, A1401G in rrs, G-10A in eis and S91P in gyrA. Additionally, two genetic clusters were found in this study: Lisboa3 and Q1. The characteristic mutational profile found among recent XDR-TB circulating in Lisbon was also found in MDR-TB strains isolated in the 1990s. Also investigated was the resistance level conferred by eis G-10A mutations, revealing that eis G-10A mutations may result in amikacin resistance undetectable by widely used phenotypic assays.The analysis of the distribution of the mutations found by genetic clustering showed that in the Q1 cluster, two mutations, gyrA D94A and rrs A1401G, were enough to ensure development of XDR-TB from an MDR strain. Moreover, in the Lisboa3 cluster it was possible to elaborate a model in which the development of low-level kanamycin resistance was at the origin of the emergence of XDR-TB strains that can be discriminated by tlyA mutations.},

  Abstract                 = {New therapeutic strategies are needed to combat the tuberculosis pandemic and the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) forms of the disease, which remain a serious public health challenge worldwide. The most urgent clinical need is to discover potent agents capable of reducing the duration of MDR and XDR tuberculosis therapy with a success rate comparable to that of current therapies for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. The last decade has seen the discovery of new agent classes for the management of tuberculosis, several of which are currently in clinical trials. However, given the high attrition rate of drug candidates during clinical development and the emergence of drug resistance, the discovery of additional clinical candidates is clearly needed. Here, we report on a promising class of imidazopyridine amide (IPA) compounds that block Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth by targeting the respiratory cytochrome bc1 complex. The optimized IPA compound Q203 inhibited the growth of MDR and XDR M. tuberculosis clinical isolates in culture broth medium in the low nanomolar range and was efficacious in a mouse model of tuberculosis at a dose less than 1 mg per kg body weight, which highlights the potency of this compound. In addition, Q203 displays pharmacokinetic and safety profiles compatible with once-daily dosing. Together, our data indicate that Q203 is a promising new clinical candidate for the treatment of tuberculosis.},

Binding of this fluorescent substrate to Tb(III)-monophosphatase was monitored by luminescence spectroscopy. The anthraniloyl chromophore excited at 330 nm sensitizes the long lived luminescence of enzyme bound Tb(III) at 490, 545, 585 and 620 nm. Assuming a mechanism of radiationless energy transfer, the actual distance of separation between the donor anthraniloyl moiety and the acceptor Tb(III) was calculated to be R = 10 angstroms. The binding studies support the earlier observation of Bone et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 (1992) 10031-10035) that the substrate and the lanthanide Gd(III) interact with a common binding domain of the protein. The catalytic activity of the monophosphatase is completely dependent upon Mg(II) ions which elicit changes in the secondary structure of the protein as revealed by circular dichroism measurements. Binding of Mg(II) ions tend to stabilize the secondary structure of the phosphatase against guanidinium-HCl denaturation.},

Addition of glycerol produces a progressive enhancement of the fluorescence yield to a limiting value at about 70\% v/v glycerol. Glycerol enhancement of fluorescence is also observed for monomeric Trp, and a good correlation exists between this effect and literature estimates of the fractional degree of Trp exposure in nine globular proteins. The estimate of fractional Trp exposure in bacteriorhodopsin from this correlation (50 +/- 15\%) is in agreement with the value obtained by spectral differentiation and also by modified Stern-Volmer curves for quenching by water-soluble acrylamide. The absence of significant quenching by Tb(III) or Eu(III) ions, which may be expected to bind to the purple membrane surface, shows that the exposed Trp residues are in contact with water in intraprotein regions of the membrane and may be the first direct evidence for a transmembrane aqueous channel by which protons are actively transported during the bacteriorhodopsin photochemical cycle.},

  Abstract                 = {The prevalence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), defined as TB that is resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides, is rising worldwide. The extent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to fluoroquinolones depends on the mutation in the DNA gyrase, the only target of fluoroquinolones. The MIC of moxifloxacin, the most active fluoroquinolone against M. tuberculosis, may be lower than its peak serum level for some ofloxacin-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, if the MIC of moxifloxacin is lower than its peak serum level, it may be effective against XDR-TB. Our objective was to determine the efficacy of moxifloxacin in treating ofloxacin-resistant TB. We selected isogenic fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in vivo. We infected Swiss mice with either wild-type H37Rv or one of three mutant strains with different MICs that are commonly seen in clinical practice. The MICs of the mutant strains ranged from below to above the peak moxifloxacin level seen in humans (3 μg/ml). Each mouse was treated with one of four moxifloxacin doses for 1 month. Moxifloxacin was effective against mutant strain GyrB D500N, with the lowest MIC (0.5 μg/ml), when the standard dose was doubled. Moxifloxacin reduced mortality in mice infected with mutant strain GyrA A90V with an intermediate MIC (2 μg/ml). However, it had no impact on the mutant strain GyrA D94G with the highest MIC (4 μg/ml). Our study underscores current WHO recommendations to use moxifloxacin when there is resistance to early-generation fluoroquinolones such as ofloxacin, restricting this recommendation to strains with moxifloxacin MICs of less than or equal to 2 μg/ml.},

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides a potential tool for non-invasive evaluation of the trabecular bone structure. The objective of this study was to determine the reproducibility of the NMR relaxation parameters (T(2), Carr-Purcel-T(2), T(1ρ)) for fat and water and relate those to the structural parameters obtained by micro-computed tomography (μCT). Especially, we aimed to evaluate the effect of freezing on the relaxation parameters. For storing bone samples, freezing is the standard procedure during which the biochemical and cellular organization of the bone marrow may be affected. Bovine trabecular bone samples were stored at -20 °C for 7 days and measured by NMR spectroscopy before and after freezing. The reproducibility of NMR relaxation parameters, as expressed by the coefficient of variation, ranged from 3.1\% to 27.9\%. In fresh samples, some correlations between NMR and structural parameters (Tb.N, Tb.Sp) were significant (e.g. the relaxation rate for T(2) of fat versus Tb.Sp: r = -0.716, p < 0.01). Freezing did not significantly change the NMR relaxation times but the correlations between relaxation parameters and the μCT structural parameters were not statistically significant after freezing, suggesting some nonsystematic alterations of the marrow structure. Therefore, the use of frozen bone samples for NMR relaxation studies may provide inferior information about the trabecular bone structure.},

The DP of the different cement specimens was calculated from the spectra and statistically analysed (ANOVA). There was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) between the DP of 3M and E in the two different activation modes. The light-cured specimens attained a statistically higher degree of polymerisation. CB obtained a statistically significant higher degree of polymerisation (P < 0.01) compared with 3M and E at 24 hours.},

The anti-tuberculosis active triterpenes from the Alaskan ethnobotanical Oplopanax horridus were selected as a case for the development of the quantitative PAR (QPAR) concept. The residual complexity of the purified triterpenes was initially evaluated by 1D- and 2D-NMR and identified as a combination of structurally related and unrelated impurities. Using a biochemometric approach, the qHNMR purity and anti-TB activity of successive chromatographic fractions of O. horridus triterpenes were correlated by linear regression analysis to generate a mathematical QPAR model. The results demonstrate that impurities, such as widely occurring monoglycerides, can have a profound impact on the observed antimycobacterial activity of triterpene-enriched fractions. The QPAR concept is shown to be capable of providing a quantitative assessment in situations where residually complex constitution contributes toward the biological activity of natural products.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis is still one of the most important causes of death worldwide. The 2010 Lancet tuberculosis series provided a comprehensive overview of global control efforts and challenges. In this update we review recent progress. With improved control efforts, the world and most regions are on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of decreasing tuberculosis incidence by 2015, and the Stop TB Partnership target of halving 1990 mortality rates by 2015; the exception is Africa. Despite these advances, full scale-up of tuberculosis and HIV collaborative activities remains challenging and emerging drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major threat. Recognition of the effect that non-communicable diseases--such as smoking-related lung disease, diet-related diabetes mellitus, and alcohol and drug misuse--have on individual vulnerability, as well as the contribution of poor living conditions to community vulnerability, shows the need for multidisciplinary approaches. Several new diagnostic tests are being introduced in endemic countries and for the first time in 40 years a coordinated portfolio of promising new tuberculosis drugs exists. However, none of these advances offer easy solutions. Achievement of international tuberculosis control targets and maintenance of these gains needs optimum national health policies and services, with ongoing investment into new approaches and strategies. Despite growing funding in recent years, a serious shortfall persists. International and national financial uncertainty places gains at serious risk. Perseverance and renewed commitment are needed to achieve global control of tuberculosis, and ultimately, its elimination.},

In addition to routine polio immunization included in the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI), two major activities were planned: mass polio vaccination campaigns and surveillance of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis. In 2000, the disease had been eliminated from most countries in the world. However, as of 2002, the community acceptance of vaccination was endangered in some countries by rumors about assumed adverse effects of oral polio vaccine. The rejection of polio immunization provided a worrying resurgence of polio in Northern Nigeria, followed by re-infection of 21 countries, whereas resurgence of the disease also was observed in Northern India. Supplementary vaccination activities were resumed, additional resources were mobilized and, in 2007, most re-infected countries became polio-free again. Today, polio remains endemic in only four countries. The goal of global polio eradication has now been set at 2010, but doubts have been expressed about the feasibility of its achievement.},

  Abstract                 = {7F0 ---- 5D0 excitation spectroscopy of Eu(III) has shown that human Factor Xa has two high affinity lanthanide ion-binding sites. The deuterium isotope effect on the reciprocal lifetime (tau-1) of excited Eu(III) in human Factor Xa has indicated that 2 to 3 water molecules remain on Eu(III) after being complexed by Factor Xa, suggesting that 3-6 ligand atoms are provided by the protein, probably through two or three gamma-carboxyglutamic acids (GLA). F orster -type interlanthanide energy transfer has been utilized to measure the distance between the high affinity metal ion-binding sites of human Factor Xa using Tb(III) as an energy donor and Nd(III), Ho(III), or Er(III) as energy acceptors. Tau-1 values of Tb(III) in the presence of the acceptor ions Nd(III), Ho(III), and Er(III) were 1.90, 1.66, and 1.76 ms-1, respectively, which compared to 1.31 ms-1 in the presence of the nonacceptor ion Gd(III), yield energy transfer efficiencies of 0.29, 0.20, and 0.24, respectively. From these efficiencies and published critical distances (R0) ( Horrocks , W. DeW ., Jr., Rhee , M-J., Snyder, A. P., and Sudnick , D. R. (1980) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 102, 3650-3652), the distance between two high affinity sites is estimated to be 10.7 A. Based on these data, we propose that the two high affinity sites of human Factor Xa consist of two paired GLA residues; GLA-19, GLA-20 and GLA-25, GLA-26 together with one of the remaining single GLA residues for each site.},

  Abstract                 = {A measles epidemic in a modern suburban elementary school in upstate New York in spring, 1974, is analyzed in terms of a model which provides a basis for apportioning the chance of infection from classmates sharing the same home room, from airborne organisms recirculated by the ventilating system, and from exposure in school buses. The epidemic was notable because of its explosive nature and its occurrence in a school where 97\% of the children had been vaccinated. Many had been vaccinated at less than one year of age. The index case was a girl in second grade who produced 28 secondary cases in 14 different classrooms. Organisms recirculated by the ventilating system were strongly implicated. After two subsequent generations, 60 children had been infected, and the epidemic subsided. From estimates of major physical and biologic factors, it was possible to calculate that the index case produced approximately 93 units of airborne infection (quanta) per minute. The epidemic pattern suggested that the secondaries were less infectious by an order of magnitude. The exceptional infectiousness of the index case, inadequate immunization of many of the children, and the high percentage of air recirculated throughout the school, are believed to account for the extent and sharpness of the outbreak.},

At the end of the last century Cornet presented evidence that tuberculosis was dust-borne, and Flügge presented equally convincing evidence that tuberculosis was droplet-borne. Chapin, in 1910, summarized evidence against the prevaling belief in airborne transmission of many common infections but made an exception of tuberculosis. Chapin emphasized transmission by direct contact (touching). In the 1930's William F. Wells introduced the droplet nucleus hypothesis. In the 1950's droplet nuclei were shown to be the carriers of infection from tuberculosis patients to guinea pigs breathing air vented from the patients' ward. Subsequent evidence has indicated that direct contact is unimportant, although close proximity facilitates airborne transmission. Attempts to control the spread of tuberculosis by air disinfection or by immunization have been disappointing. Specific antituberculosis drugs, widely used since the 1950's, cause patients to become noninfectious for others very rapidly, even before organisms in the sputum disappear. Chemotherapy is now recognized as the corner stone of contagion control.},

  Abstract                 = {A recent paper by Muller and Greff (Fd. Chem. Toxicol., 22 (1984) 661) presents QSAR equations for upper respiratory tract irritation by compounds falling into various chemical families. In the present paper the relationships are analysed further. It is found that a general QSAR equation, covering a diverse range of structures, correlates the biological activity reported by Muller and Greff with a single physicochemical parameter, TB'. The parameter TB' is the boiling point at atmospheric pressure (TB), adjusted for compounds with Trouton constants different from 22 cal deg-1 mol-1: TB' = (Tr X TB/22) + 40(1 - Tr/22) where Tr is the Trouton constant. Some of the compounds studied were found to be more irritant than predicted by the general equation: their enhanced activity can be rationalised in terms of their chemical reactivity as electrophiles, their metabolism to electrophiles, or their hydrolysis to more irritant products.},

  Abstract                 = {A great challenge is posed to the treatment of tuberculosis due to the evolution of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drugresistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in recent times. The complex cell envelope of the bacterium contains unusual structures of lipids which protects the bacterium from host enzymes and escape immune response. To overcome the drug resistance, targeting "drug targets" which have a critical role in growth and virulence factor is a novel approach for better tuberculosis treatment. The enzyme Phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PptT) is an attractive drug target as it is primarily involved in post translational modification of various types-I polyketide synthases and assembly of mycobactin, which is required for lipid virulence factors. Our in silico studies reported that the structural model of M.tuberculosis PptT characterizes the structure-function activity. The refinement of the model was carried out with molecular dynamics simulations and was analyzed with root mean square deviation (RMSD), and radius of gyration (Rg). This confirmed the structural behavior of PptT in dynamic system. Molecular docking with substrate coenzyme A (CoA) identified the binding pocket and key residues His93, Asp114 and Arg169 involved in PptT-CoA binding. In conclusion, our results show that the M.tuberculosis PptT model and critical CoA binding pocket initiate the inhibitor design of PptT towards tuberculosis treatment.},

It was used a crossover study with the children using two dentifrice brands: Tandy Uva/T (1,100 ppm NaF) and Super Branco/SB (1,500 ppm MFP). Each child brushed his/her teeth with both dentifrice brands with weekly intervals between the brushes. The oral hygiene habits considered in this study were the Dentifrice Amount Placed on toothbrush (ADP), Dentifrice Amount Ingested (ADI), Fluoride Amount Ingested (FAI) and Brushing Time (TB). The data obtained were submitted to ANOVA test. It was observed that there was influence of SEL on the ADP and TB. The high SEL children showed a higher ADP and TB. The dentifrice brand influenced significantly the ADP, ADI, AFI and TB; the dentifrice T showed a higher ADP, ADI, but a lower AFI and TB. The results showed a significant interaction between SEL and dentifrice brand as ADI, AFI and TB. Although the children ingested a higher amount of T dentifrice they ingested a higher amount of fluoride from the SB dentifrice.},

At the end of the study, RMP and INH were given for 4 months. The rates of elimination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were compared in the regimens using non-linear mixed effects modelling of the serial sputum colony counts (SSCC) during the first 8 weeks.After adjustment for covariates, MFX substitution appeared superior during the early phase of a bi-exponential fall in colony counts, but significant and similar acceleration of bacillary elimination during the late phase occurred with both GFX and MFX (P = 0.002). Substitution of OFX had no effect. These findings were supported by estimates of time to conversion, using Cox regression, but there were no significant differences in proportions culture-negative at 8 weeks.GFX and MFX improve the sterilising activity of regimens and might shorten treatment; their progression into Phase III trials therefore seems warranted.},

In recent years, various organisations have assessed research needs and proposed priorities for tuberculosis.

The top priority areas were drug development (28 articles), diagnosis and diagnostic tests (27), epidemiology (20), health services research (16), basic research (13), and vaccine development and use (13). The most focused questions were on the treatment and prevention of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in people co-infected with HIV. Methods used to identify these priorities were varied. Improvements can be made to ensure the process is more rigorous and transparent, and to use existing research or systematic reviews more often. WHO, Stop TB Partnership, and other organisations could adopt an incremental process of priority development, building on the existing knowledge base.},

The main challenge in the present era is the economically undeveloped tropical and subtropical regions with inadequate health services that are inhabited by more than half of the world population, where recent surveys for residual paralysis due to poliomyelitis have shown that the incidence of the disease has been higher than it was in the USA and other predominantly temperate-climate countries before the vaccine era. The problem in these countries is that the majority of children receive no vaccine and that the extensive year-round dissemination of virulent polioviruses requires a different strategy of vaccination from that used in the temperate-climate countries. The special point about the annual mass vaccinations with OPV for all children younger than three, four, or five years of age-which have proven highly successful in Cuba (for the past 20 years), in Brazil (during the past three years), and recently also in Mexico-is that all the children are usually vaccinated within one or two days, which quickly breaks the chain of transmission of the virulent viruses, and the annual campaigns create and maintain the maximum number of children with resistant intestinal tracts.},

  Abstract                 = {The main challenge of vaccine control of poliomyelitis in the 1980s is in the subtropical and tropical regions of the world where "lameness" surveys in recent years have shown how very high the average annual incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis can be in both rural and urban areas in the absence of epidemics. The procedures by which oral polio vaccine (OPV) rapidly eliminated all or almost all paralytic disease caused by polioviruses from the economically developed temperate climate countries have been inadequate in tropical and subtropical countries, except in some small countries with good health services, largely because there is much more year-round circulation of "wild" polioviruses which continue to produce the disease in the unvaccinated and incompletely vaccinated children. Not even a cheap, hypothetically 100 percent effective, one-dose vaccine could eliminate poliomyelitis in the tropics if, for a variety of reasons, it would reach only a portion of the infant population. Paralytic disease caused by polioviruses has been quickly eliminated from both small and large tropical countries by OPV in well-organized programs of annual mass vaccinations of almost all children under a certain age.},

For estimation of the value of clinical, laboratory, and social risk factors, the authors complied a rapid diagnostic table (RDT) that reflected 16 signs. Fischer's angular transformation method and stage-by-stage computer-aided analysis were analyzed, by detecting the diagnostic coefficients and informative value of signs, which was based on Wald's analysis called a heterogeneous sequential statistical recognition procedure. Testing this procedure indicated that their data was concordant with the results of bacterial cultures. The use of the proposed procedure make is possible in any conditions to predict the possible development of drug resistance and to take measures of its prevention.},

  Abstract                 = {Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and their signaling pathways play key roles in protection from and pathogenesis of mycobacterial infection, and their balance and dynamic changes may control or predict clinical outcome. Peripheral blood cells' capacity to produce proinflammatory (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin-12/23p40 [IL-12/23p40], and gamma interferon [IFN-gamma]) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or unrelated stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, phytohemagglutinin) was studied in 93 pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients and 127 healthy controls from Indonesia. Their cells' ability to respond to IFN-gamma was examined to investigate whether M. tuberculosis infection can also inhibit IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR) signaling. Although there was interindividual variability in the observed responses, the overall results revealed that M. tuberculosis-induced TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels showed opposite trends. Whereas TNF-alpha production was higher in active-TB patients than in controls, IFN-gamma production was strongly depressed during active TB, correlated inversely with TB disease severity, and increased during therapy. By contrast, mitogen-induced IFN-gamma production, although lower in patients than in controls, did not change during treatment, suggesting an M. tuberculosis-specific and reversible component in the depression of IFN-gamma. Depressed IFN-gamma production was not due to decreased IL-12/IL-23 production. Importantly, IFN-gamma-inducible responses were also significantly depressed during active TB and normalized during treatment, revealing disease activity-related and reversible impairment in IFN-gammaR signaling in TB. Finally, IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratios significantly correlated with TB cure. Taken together, these results show that M. tuberculosis-specific stimulation of IFN-gamma (but not TNF-alpha) production and IFN-gammaR signaling are significantly depressed in active TB, correlate with TB disease severity and activity, and normalize during microbiological TB cure. The depression of both IFN-gamma production and IFN-gammaR signaling may synergize in contributing to defective host control in active TB.},

  Abstract                 = {Development of new, effective, and affordable tuberculosis (TB) therapies has been identified as a critical priority for global TB control. As new candidates emerge from the global TB drug pipeline, the potential impacts of novel, shorter regimens on TB incidence and mortality have not yet been examined.We used a mathematical model of TB to evaluate the expected benefits of shortening the duration of effective chemotherapy for active pulmonary TB. First, we considered general relationships between treatment duration and TB dynamics. Next, as a specific example, we calibrated the model to reflect the current situation in the South-East Asia region. We found that even with continued and rapid progress in scaling up the World Health Organization's DOTS strategy of directly observed, short-course chemotherapy, the benefits of reducing treatment duration would be substantial. Compared to a baseline of continuing DOTS coverage at current levels, and with currently available tools, a 2-mo regimen introduced by 2012 could prevent around 20\% (range 13\%-28\%) of new cases and 25\% (range 19\%-29\%) of TB deaths in South-East Asia between 2012 and 2030. If effective treatment with existing drugs expands rapidly, overall incremental benefits of shorter regimens would be lower, but would remain considerable (13\% [range 8\%-19\%] and 19\% [range 15\%-23\%] reductions in incidence and mortality, respectively, between 2012 and 2030). A ten-year delay in the introduction of new drugs would erase nearly three-fourths of the total expected benefits in this region through 2030.The introduction of new, shorter treatment regimens could dramatically accelerate the reductions in TB incidence and mortality that are expected under current regimens-with up to 2- or 3-fold increases in rates of decline if shorter regimens are accompanied by enhanced case detection. Continued progress in reducing the global TB burden will require a balanced approach to pursuing new technologies while promoting wider implementation of proven strategies.},

Increase in the incidences of life-threatening multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extreme drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis worsens the existing scenario and urge the need of new druggable targets and new drugs. Targeting Rv3802c, an essential cell wall lipase, can open up a new arsenal to fight the dreadful opportunistic pathogen. Our current study highlights the essentiality of Rv3802c. Its 3D structure is predicted for the first time which provides insight in identifying the ligand binding sites. Our analysis showed Rv3802c is highly conserved throughout mycobacterial species with no significant sequence homolog found in human proteome. Virtual screening followed by comparative docking studies of Rv3802c with its closest human structural homolog has been carried out to identify potential inhibitors effective towards mycobacterial proteins. Two diverse molecules from ZINC database, ZINC26726377 and ZINC43866786 have been identified as potential inhibitors effective towards Rv3802c based on the difference in predicted binding free energy of -3.99 and -3.28kcal/mol respectively. Rv3802c is a promising drug target and also a step towards understanding and targeting the pathogen's cell wall and lipid metabolism simultaneously to combat tuberculosis.},

We therefore assessed two aspects of TB management in Soweto: (i) the proportion of known tuberculous patients adequately treated; (ii) whether case finding through investigation of home contacts of notified patients was effective. In 1978 patients with TB were required to take chemotherapy for at least a year. Only 28\% of newly notified patients attended the clinics frequently enough and/or were hospitalized long enough to obtain 80\% or more of the treatment they required during that first year. A major part of this problem of non-compliance was infrequent attendance; these patients received therapy of an adequate duration, but at an inadequate dosage. At least 17\% of patients over 10 years of age had tubercle bacilli in their sputa on microscopy more than 4 months after therapy was started. About two-thirds of known home contacts were investigated by the health services in accordance with their stated policy, and 5\% of contacts were subsequently notified. Home-contact tracing therefore seems worthwhile.},

We show that these time and money budgets are stable over space and time and can be used for projecting future levels of mobility and transport mode. The fixed travel money budget requires that mobility rises nearly in proportion with income. Covering greater distances within the same fixed travel time budget requires that travelers shift to faster modes of transport. The choice of future transport modes is also constrained by path dependence because transport infrastructures change only slowly. In addition, demand for low-speed public transport is partially determined by urban population densities and land-use characteristics. We present a model that incorporates these constraints, which we use for projecting traffic volume and the share of the major motorized modes of transportâ€”automobiles, buses, trains and high speed transport (mainly aircraft)â€”for 11 regions and the world through 2050. We project that by 2050 the average world citizen will travel as many kilometers as the average West European in 1990. The average American's mobility will rise by a factor of 2.6 by 2050, to 58,000 km/year. The average Indian travels 6000&#xa0;km/year by 2050, comparable with West European levels in the early 1970s.

  Abstract                 = {The hypothesis was tested that slow-growing grass species perform a greater proportion of total plant NO3- reduction in their roots than do fast-growing grasses. Eight grass species were selected that differed in maximum relative growth rate (RGR) and net NO3- uptake rate (NNUR). Plants were grown with free access to nutrients in hydroponics under controlled-environment conditions. The site of in vivo NO3- reduction was assessed by combining in vivo NO3- reductase activity (NRA) assays with biomass allocation data, and by analysing the NO3- to amino acid ratio of xylem sap. In vivo NRA of roots and shoots increased significantly with increasing NNUR and RGR. The proportion of total plant NO3- reduction that occurs in roots was found to be independent of RGR and NNUR, with the shoot being the predominant site of NO3- reduction in all species. The theoretical maximum proportion of whole plant nitrogen assimilation that could take place in the roots was calculated using information on root respiration rates, RGR, NNUR, and specific respiratory costs associated with growth, maintenance and ion uptake. The calculated maximum proportion that the roots can contribute to total plant NO3- reduction was 0.37 and 0.23 for the fast-growing Dactylis glomerata L. and the slow-growing Festuca ovina L., respectively. These results indicate that slow-growing grass species perform a similar proportion of total plant NO3- reduction in their roots to that exhibited by fast-growing grasses. Shoots appear to be the predominant site of whole plant NO3- reduction in both fast- and slow-growing grasses when plants are grown with free access to nutrients.},

Through collaboration with local government officials, we have surveyed a rural county and its communities and collected a dataset characterizing the rural population.

With this network, we explore the potential spread of epidemics through a Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered (SLIR) disease model. We simulate an exact model of a stochastic SLIR Poisson process with disease parameters representing a typical influenza-like illness. We test vaccine distribution strategies under limited resources. We examine global and location-based distribution strategies, as a way to reach critical individuals in the rural setting. We demonstrate that locations can be identified through contact metrics for use in vaccination strategies to control contagious diseases.},

We assessed the current strategy of radiographic screening of legal immigrants plus current tuberculosis-control programs alone and with the addition of either U.S.-funded expansion of the strategy of directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS), in Mexico or tuberculin skin testing to screen legal immigrants from Mexico. We also examined tuberculosis-related outcomes among migrants from Haiti and the Dominican Republic using the same three strategies.As compared with the current strategy, expanding the DOTS program in Mexico at a cost to the United States of 34.9 million dollars would result in 2591 fewer cases of tuberculosis in the United States, with 349 fewer deaths from the disease and net discounted savings of 108 million dollars over a 20-year period. Adding tuberculin skin testing to radiographic screening of legal immigrants from Mexico would result in 401 fewer cases of tuberculosis in the United States but would cost an additional 329 million dollars. Expansion of the DOTS program would remain cost saving even if the initial investment were doubled, if the United States paid for all antituberculosis drugs in Mexico, or if the decline in the incidence of tuberculosis in Mexico was less than projected. A 9.4 million dollars investment to expand the DOTS program in Haiti and the Dominican Republic would result in net U.S. savings of 20 million dollars over a 20-year period.U.S.-funded efforts to expand the DOTS program in Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic could reduce tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality among migrants to the United States, producing net cost savings for the United States.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: In July 2009, French public health authorities embarked in a mass vaccination campaign against A/H1N1 2009 pandemic-influenza. We explored the attitudes and behaviors of the general population toward pandemic vaccination. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 2,253 French representative adults aged 18 to 64 from November 17 to 25, 2009 (completion rate: 93.8\%). The main outcome was the acceptability of A/H1N1 vaccination as defined by previous receipt or intention to get vaccinated ("Yes, certainly", "Yes, probably"). Overall 17.0\% (CI 95\%, 15.5\% to 18.7\%) of respondents accepted A/H1N1 vaccination. Independent factors associated with acceptability included: male sex (p = .0001); older age (p = .002); highest or lowest level of education (p = .016); non-clerical occupation (p = .011); having only one child (p = .008); and having received seasonal flu vaccination in prior 3 years (p<.0001). Acceptability was also significantly higher among pregnant women (37.9\%) and other at risk groups with chronic diseases (34.8\%) (p = .002). Only 35.5\% of respondents perceived A/H1N1 influenza illness as a severe disease and 12.7\% had experienced A/H1N1 cases in their close relationships with higher acceptability (p<.0001 and p = .006, respectively). In comparison to 26.0\% respondents who did not consult their primary care physician, acceptability was significantly higher among 8.0\% respondents who were formally advised to get vaccinated, and lower among 63.7\% respondents who were not advised to get vaccinated (respectively: 15.8\%, 59.5\% and 11.7\%- p<.0001). Among respondents who refused vaccination, 71.2\% expressed concerns about vaccine safety. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our survey occurred one week before the peak of the pandemic in France. We found that alarming public health messages aiming at increasing the perception of risk severity were counteracted by daily personal experience which did not confirm the threat, while vaccine safety was a major issue. This dissonance may have been amplified by having not involved primary care physicians in the mass vaccination campaign.},

  Abstract                 = {Empirical field data describing daily and seasonal cycles in body temperature (Tb) of free-ranging Crocodylus porosus (32-1010 kg) can be predicted by a mathematical analysis. The analysis provides a mechanistic explanation for the decreased amplitude of daily cycles in Tb and the increase in 'average' Tb with increasing mass. Assessments of 'average' daily Tb were made by dividing the integral of the difference between measured values of Tb and minimum operative temperature by the period of integration, to yield a thermal index expressing relative 'warmth' of crocodiles. The average daily Tb of a 1010 kg crocodile was 3.7 degreesC warmer than that of a 42 kg individual in summer and 1.9 degreesC warmer than that of a 32 kg individual in winter. The success of this mathematical approach confirms that crocodiles are simple ectotherms and that there is unlikely to be a significant contribution to their thermal biology from physiological mechanisms. Behaviour, however, is very important even in large individuals. Crocodiles in the field typically move daily between land and water in cycles that vary seasonally. We predicted Tb for the reverse of these behavioural cycles, which more than doubled seasonal fluctuations in Tb compared with the observed fluctuations. We were also able to predict the Tb of very large, dinosaur-sized crocodiles in a similar climate to that at our study site. A 10 000 kg 'crocodile', for example, would be expected to have a Tb of 31 degreesC in winter, varying by less than 0.1 degreesC during a day when operative temperatures varied by nearly 20 degreesC, from 20 to 38 degreesC. The study confirms that, in low latitudes at least, large dinosaurs must have had an essentially high and stable value of Tb, without any need for endothermy. Also, access to shade or water must have been crucial for the survival of large dinosaurs at low latitudes. Furthermore, the finding of increasing 'average' Tb as ectotherms grow larger may have implications for the metabolic rates of very large reptiles, because the Q10 effect could counteract the downscaling of metabolic rate with mass, an effect that seems not to have been recognised previously.},

Using a modified algorithm which was previously developed for ZnO, we take only bulk absorption data from the literature and match the PSDs derived from QD absorbance spectra with those from transmission electron microscopical (TEM) image analysis in order to arrive at the functional dependence of the band gap on particle size. Additional samples sized solely from their absorbance spectra with our algorithm show excellent agreement with TEM results. We investigate the influence of parameters of the TEM image analysis such as threshold value on the final result. The band gap versus size relationship developed from analysis of just two samples lies well within the bounds of a number of published data sets. We believe that our methodology provides an attractive shortcut for the study of various novel quantum-confined direct band gap semiconductor systems as it permits the band gap energies of a broad size range of QDs to be probed with relatively few synthetic experiments and without quantum mechanical simulations.},

Seventy-seven additional patients participated in the validation of the model.The final population pharmacokinetic model obtained was as follows: apparent clearance CL/F = 8·17 L/h (1·40 as high for males), apparent distribution volume V(d)/F = 50·1 L (1·29 as high for males), absorption rate constant K(aA) = 0·391/h, K(aB,C,D) = 2·70/h, relative bioavailability F(A) = 0·468, F(B,C,D) = 1, lag time in the absorption phase T(lag) = 0·264 h. The final model improved the precision on the parameter estimates (CL/F, V(d) /F and K(a) by 31·9\%, 16·7\% and 92·9\%, respectively). The residual variability was 27·3\%.Gender was associated with changes in CL/F and V(d) /F whereas the pharmaceutical formulation was associated with changes in F and altered the K(a) . The validation data set showed that the model could be used in clinical practice for Bayesian dose adjustment of RIF in TB patients.},

  Abstract                 = {3-Dimensional coordinates of Golgi-impregnated neurons in left and right human areas TA, TB and TC were stored using computer microscopy. The tangential extent of neurons was taken to be an estimate of their effective radius, which is a compromise between their maximum radius and the average tangential projection of their dendrites. Analysis of variance and t-test comparisons were made among the areas and between the hemispheres on a total data base of 622 neurons. It was assumed that the neurons are organized in functional columns. The tangential extent of left-hemisphere columns is absolutely larger than on the right, but is smaller relative to the column-column interval. Neuropil on the left is packed more densely with dendrites belonging to the nearest column. It seems that during the course of evolution interconnected units (as in the right hemisphere) have become more disentangled (left hemisphere), yielding perhaps a greater capacity for differentiated responses in the latter case. A more detailed analysis revealed that much of the difference between areas and/or hemispheres was due to the pyramidal neurons. The structure of non-pyramidal cells is relatively consistent within each hemisphere and shows non-systematic differences between the hemispheres.},

  Abstract                 = {In the medical domain, establishing a diagnosis typically amounts to reasoning about the unobservable truth, based upon a set of indirect observations from diagnostic tests. A diagnostic test may not be perfectly reliable, however. To avoid misdiagnosis, therefore, the reliability characteristics of the test should be taken into account upon reasoning.In this paper, we address the issue of modelling the reliability characteristics of diagnostic tests in a probabilistic network.To this end, we study the mathematical foundation of a test's characteristics and collate them with the probabilities required for a probabilistic network.We show that the standard reliability characteristics that are generally available from the literature have to be further detailed and stratified, for example by experts, before they can be included in a network. We demonstrate these modelling issues by means of a real-life probabilistic network in oncology.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Vaccination against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 is an effective strategy to mitigate the spread of the disease. While the vaccine is now available, social acceptance remains relatively uncertain in many societies. The purpose of this study was to examine the beliefs, attitudes and practices associated with the intention to get vaccinated against the A/H1N1 virus among the general population in France. METHODS: A representative sample of 1001 individuals (stratified random recruitment procedure, ages 16-90 years) was interviewed by telephone. The questionnaire included a variety of items associated with socio-demographic characteristics, risk perceptions, illness perceptions, political attitudes and worldviews as well as intention to get vaccinated. RESULTS: More than 6 out of 10 of the respondents indicated that they planned to get vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available. The same proportion of parents also reported the intention to vaccinate their children against the disease. In multiple regression analyses, socio-cognitive factors consistently predicting influenza A/H1N1 vaccination were: level of worry, risk perception and previous experience of vaccine against seasonal flu. CONCLUSIONS: The factors found to predict vaccination intention and their distribution are assumed to be a consequence of the fact that people perceive the risk of swine flu to be similar to that of seasonal flu. As a result, in the absence of an increase of the risk perception of pandemic influenza A/H1N1, a very low level of actual vaccination is forecasted. Behavioural change would require that the risks and consequences of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 be perceived as highly different from seasonal flu.},

Here we present web tools that facilitate systematic analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) genotype information and provide a view of the genetic diversity in the MTBC population. These tools help answer questions about the characteristics of MTBC strains, such as their pathogenicity, virulence, immunogenicity, transmissibility, drug-resistance profiles and host-pathogen associativity. They provide an integrated platform for researchers to use molecular epidemiological data to address current challenges in the understanding of TB dynamics and the characteristics of MTBC.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper documents and attempts to explain the epidemic spread of tuberculosis (TB) in Russia during the 1990s. After several decades of decline, the notification rate of all new TB cases among permanent residents increased by 7.5\% per year from 1991-1999 and the death rate by 11\% per year. Growth was quickest from 1993-1995 but increased again after the economic crisis of August 1998. Approximately 120 000 new cases and 30 000 deaths were reported in 1999. Case detection and cure rates have fallen in Russia since the mid-1980s; the fall has been accompanied by a higher frequency of severe disease among cases, and higher death and case fatality rates. With a mathematical model describing the deterioration in case finding and cure rates we could replicate the average rate of increase in incidence 1991-1999 but not the precise timing of the observed changes. Other factors that probably helped to shape the observed rise in caseload include enhanced transmission due to the mixing of prison and civilian populations, an increase in susceptibility to disease, and changes in the proportion of cases detected by surveillance. Although our explanation for the resurgence of TB is incomplete, we have identified a set of measures that can be implemented now to cut transmission, incidence and deaths.},

After initial experiments on rats, the method was applied on 13 men and 6 women. Muscles with different fiber compositions (soleus, S; vastus lateralis, (VL; gastrocnemius, G; triceps brachii, TB) were studied at rest. The total water content was the same for all muscles, 320 (313-330) ml/100 g dry wt. However, differences were demonstrated for H2Oe, with 26-34 ml/100 g dry wt in VL and 38-54 ml/100 g dry wt in S, (P less than 0.05); the values for G and TB were in between those for VL and S. The differences in H2Oe were not related to the fiber composition of the muscles. During 3 x 3 min of intense bicycle exercise demanding about 120\% VO2 max (6 men), total water content increased in VL from 313 to 359 ml/100 g dry wt and H2Oe increased from 34 to 60 ml/100 g dry wt (P less than 0.05), In TB, which is relatively inactive during bicycle exercise, no such changes occurred. The calculated intracellular lactate concentration increased in VL from 5.7 to 30.6 mmol/l H2Oi. The extracellular lactate concentration amounted to 13.6 mmol/l H2Oe at the end of exercise. The concentration gradient for lactate of 2 from intra- to extracellular space favored a flux of water to the intracellular space. The relative large increase in H2Oe may then be caused by a hydrostatic rather than an osmotic factor.U},

  Abstract                 = {To evaluate fracture rate and bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with dexamethasone-based chemotherapy.Children with ALL (n = 61) participated. At diagnosis, during therapy, and one year after cessation of therapy, BMD and body composition were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry of lumbar spine (LS) and total body (TB). Serum markers of bone turnover were assessed.BMD(LS) was significantly reduced at diagnosis, and remained low during therapy. BMD(TB) was normal at diagnosis, with a fast decrease in the first 32 weeks, in which chemotherapy was relatively intensive. Apparent ("volumetric") BMD(LS) was also reduced, but this did not reach significance at diagnosis and follow-up. Bone formation markers were reduced at diagnosis; formation as well as resorption markers increased during treatment. Fracture rate was 6 times higher in ALL patients compared with healthy controls. Lean body mass was decreased at baseline. Percentage of body fat increased significantly during therapy. After ALL treatment was completed, BMD and body composition tended to improve.Children with ALL are at risk for osteopenia because of the disease itself and the intensive chemotherapy. Fracture rate increases substantially, not only during but also shortly after treatment.},

  abstract    = {Application of a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence to a nuclear spin system consisting of two components, whose spins do not exchange or exchange slowly on the scale of the shorter time constant, results in the nuclear magnetization Mz of the spin system decaying according to the relation Mz = Ma exp(-t/Ta)+Mb exp(-t/Tb)+K+E where Ma,Ta are the intensity and transverse relaxation time of one component, Mb and Tb are the corresponding values for the second component, K is a constant and E is the contribution due to noise. Data simulation according to the above function was carried out with different values for the parameters Ma, Ta, Mb, Tb and K, the noise component being normally distributed with mean zero. For each set of parameters, the data generation was repeated a number of times with a different noise content and in each case, the parameters were estimated using a non-linear least square curve fitting procedure. The mean and percent coefficient of variation (CV) of each parameter was calculated. The value of CV is taken as a measure of the uncertainty in the estimated value of the parameter. It is found that the uncertainty in the estimated values of the parameters is due to the random noise. The range of data points is more critical than the number of data points used in curve fitting. Moreover, the uncertainty associated with each parameter increases with decreasing Ma/Mb ratio and increases with increasing Ta/Tb ratio. Higher signal to noise ratios will be required to analyse data with low Ma/Mb and high Ta/Tb ratios.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract    = {Due to emergence of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, there is a need to have accurate and rapid methods for detection of drug resistance to important drugs like rifampicin. The present study was aimed at evaluation of a commercially available INNO-LiPA assay, for the detection of mutation in rpoB gene region of M. tuberculosis and correlate these mutations with levels of rifampicin resistance for assessing their clinical relevance.Fifty five well-characterized isolates of M. tuberculosis deposited from various regions of India in Mycobacterial Repository Centre at the CJILOMD, Agra were subjected to susceptibility testing for rifampicin at various concentrations of drug viz., 10, 40, 64, 128 microg/ml on Lowenstein- Jensen (LJ) medium. rpoB gene fragment (260 bp) was amplified using Rif-TB amplification kit and after hybridization, detection was done by using INNO-LiPA Rif TB kit.The rpoB gene could be amplified from DNA extracted from all the 55 culture isolates and showed clear hybridization pattern with M. tuberculosis complex specific probes on LiPA strips. Mutations detected were correlated with degree of rifampicin resistance. All the sensitive isolates (identified by MIC) were identified as rifampicin sensitive (100\%) by INNO-LiPA as they exhibit positive for wild type 'S' probes and negative for 'R' probes. Two of the 5 isolates, resistant at 10 microg/ml and 40 microg/ml had either D516V, H526Y mutations or unknown mutations. Thirty (85.71\%) isolates resistant at clinically relevant levels (64,128microg/ml) exhibited double, triple or more 'R' type mutations (R(2(D516V)), R(4a(H526Y)), R(4b(H526D)), R(5(S531L))) as well as unknown mutations present at 'S' probes region whereas remaining isolates did not show any mutation by this method. This method could identify with definitiveness 60 per cent ( 21/35) isolates as rifampicin resistant as mutations observed in others were also present in isolates with low levels of resistance.The results indicate that INNO-LiPA Rif TB test is a rapid and easy to use method for detection of mutations associated with rifampicin resistance in M. tuberculosis. However, as some of these mutations are also present in isolates with low degree of resistance which are still microbiologically sensitive to rifampicin, there is a need to improve this assay by exclusion of some of the current probes and inclusion of more probes.},

This approach estimated a global incidence of 39.9 million measles cases, 777,000 deaths, and 28 million disability-adjusted life years. The World Health Organization regions of Africa and Southeast Asia had 70\% of incident cases and 84\% of measles-related deaths; 11 countries alone (Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, Uganda) account for 66\% of deaths. This approach quantifies the measles burden by considering country-specific indicators, which can be updated, permitting an assessment of country, regional, and global changes in the burden associated with measles infection.},

Counting backgrounds for a long time reduces decision levels, uncertainties, and minimum detectable activities. These benefits are fully available only when there is no other source of variability than random fluctuations in count rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Although theoretical approaches to tracheobronchial (TB) clearance have been continuously refined during the past decades, questions concerning the exact course of particle removal from the TB tree have been largely remained unsolved. In order to clarify this problem, three-dimensional patterns of mucociliary particle clearance have to be generated at pre-defined time points after particle exposure. Here, we present a mathematical method for the generation of respective clearance patterns. Three-dimensional transport paths of inhaled particles as well as spatial deposition patterns were generated by determining spatial information of all airway tubes passed by the particles and the particle deposition sites. Three-dimensional data were converted to a coordinate system, within which the trachea represented the z-axis. Visualization of stored data was realized with the help of a freely available program code that is specialized in processing huge data sets. Mucociliary clearance of deposited particular mass was computed by assuming (1) an interrelationship between mucus velocity and airway caliber and (2) an average tracheal mucus velocity of 5.5mm min(-1). Position of cleared particles within the spatial TB tree was determined at t=0 h (immediately after exposure), t=12 h and t=24 h. Spatial patterns of mucociliary clearance were computed for particles with a uniform geometric diameter of 5μm and a density of 1g cm(-3). Inhalation of the aerosol loaded with those particles took place under sitting breathing conditions (breathing frequency: 15min(-1), tidal volume: 750 ml). As demonstrated by the generated clearance patterns, mucociliary transport of 5μm particles is completed after 30 h. Within the first 12 h following aerosol exposure, about 75\% of the initially deposited particular mass is removed from the TB tree. After 24 h, 95\% of the particles have been cleared. Clearance patterns are characterized by a successive transition of maximal particle concentrations towards more proximal airway generations. For 0.1μm particles and 1μm particles clearance times are significantly prolonged, whilst 10μm particles are even faster removed from the TB tree than the 5μm particles. Based on the results of this study the time span between initial deposition of particular matter and complete evacuation of deposited particles ranges from several hours to some days and depends on (1) the preferential deposition site of the inhaled material and (2) the mean mucus velocities in the bronchial airway generations.},

Local sweat rates from both forearms were continuously recorded in a steady state of each exposure, using capacitance hygrometry. In the absence of spontaneous sweating, localized sweating was induced by intradermal administration of pilocarpine. Sweat expulsions synchronous at the two test areas were counted and their frequency (Fsw) was calculated. For each of additive and multiplicative combinations of Tcore (Tre, Tty) and Ts, the best combination for estimation of thermal input to the sudomotor center was determined using multiple regression analysis. Approximately 0.75Tre + 0.25Ts or 0.85Tty + 0.15Ts, and (Tre-36.33) (Ts-33.13) or (Tty-36.42) (Ts-32.24) were obtained for the additive and multiplicative combinations, respectively. The correlation coefficient (r) for the relationship of Fsw to the obtained best combination, either additive or multiplicative, and that of Fsw to Tb were almost comparable to each other. It is considered that Tb can be used as an approximation of thermal input and that the characteristics of frequency of sweat expulsion is a useful index for determining whether and how much the central sudomotor mechanism is involved in the change of sweat rate in response to various thermal and non-thermal stresses.},

We investigated the epidemiology of HA-BSI and evaluated the impact of drug resistance on outcomes of critically ill patients, controlling for patient characteristics and infection management.A prospective, multicentre non-representative cohort study was conducted in 162 intensive care units (ICUs) in 24 countries.We included 1,156 patients [mean ± standard deviation (SD) age, 59.5 ± 17.7 years; 65 \% males; mean ± SD Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score, 50 ± 17] with HA-BSIs, of which 76 \% were ICU-acquired. Median time to diagnosis was 14 [interquartile range (IQR), 7-26] days after hospital admission. Polymicrobial infections accounted for 12 \% of cases. Among monomicrobial infections, 58.3 \% were gram-negative, 32.8 \% gram-positive, 7.8 \% fungal and 1.2 \% due to strict anaerobes. Overall, 629 (47.8 \%) isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR), including 270 (20.5 \%) extensively resistant (XDR), and 5 (0.4 \%) pan-drug-resistant (PDR). Micro-organism distribution and MDR occurrence varied significantly (p < 0.001) by country. The 28-day all-cause fatality rate was 36 \%. In the multivariable model including micro-organism, patient and centre variables, independent predictors of 28-day mortality included MDR isolate [odds ratio (OR), 1.49; 95 \% confidence interval (95 \%CI), 1.07-2.06], uncontrolled infection source (OR, 5.86; 95 \%CI, 2.5-13.9) and timing to adequate treatment (before day 6 since blood culture collection versus never, OR, 0.38; 95 \%CI, 0.23-0.63; since day 6 versus never, OR, 0.20; 95 \%CI, 0.08-0.47).MDR and XDR bacteria (especially gram-negative) are common in HA-BSIs in critically ill patients and are associated with increased 28-day mortality. Intensified efforts to prevent HA-BSIs and to optimize their management through adequate source control and antibiotic therapy are needed to improve outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Various infectious agents are known to be transmitted naturally via respiratory aerosols produced by infected patients. Such aerosols may be produced during normal activities by breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. The schlieren optical method, previously applied mostly in engineering and physics, can be effectively used here to visualize airflows around human subjects in such indoor situations, non-intrusively and without the need for either tracer gas or airborne particles. It accomplishes this by rendering visible the optical phase gradients owing to real-time changes in air temperature. In this study, schlieren video records are obtained of human volunteers coughing with and without wearing standard surgical and N95 masks. The object is to characterize the exhaled airflows and evaluate the effect of these commonly used masks on the fluid-dynamic mechanisms that spread infection by coughing. Further, a high-speed schlieren video of a single cough is analysed by a computerized method of tracking individual turbulent eddies, demonstrating the non-intrusive velocimetry of the expelled airflow. Results show that human coughing projects a rapid turbulent jet into the surrounding air, but that wearing a surgical or N95 mask thwarts this natural mechanism of transmitting airborne infection, either by blocking the formation of the jet (N95 mask), or by redirecting it in a less harmful direction (surgical mask).},

  Abstract                 = {The kinetics of binding of Cu(II), Tb(III) and Fe(III) to ovotransferrin have been investigated using the stopped-flow technique. Rate constants for the second-order reaction, k+, were determined by monitoring the absorbance change upon formation of the metal-transferrin complex in time range of milliseconds to seconds. The N and C sites appeared to bind a particular metal ion with the same rate; thus, average formation rate constants k+ (average) were 2.4 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 and 8.3 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 for Cu(II) and Tb(III) respectively. Site preference (N site for Cu(II) and C site for Tb(III] is then mainly due to the difference in dissociation rate constant for the metals. Fe(III) binding from Fe-nitrilotriacetate complex to apo-ovotransferrin was found to be more rapid, giving an average formation rate constant k+ (average) of 5 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, which was followed by a slow increase in absorbance at 465 nm. This slow process has an apparent rate constant in the range 3 s-1 to 0.5 s-1, depending upon the degree of Fe(III) saturation. The variation in the rate of the second phase is thought to reflect the difference in the rate of a conformational change for monoferric and diferric ovotransferrins. Monoferric ovotransferrin changes its conformation more rapidly (3.4 s-1) than diferric ovotransferrin (0.52 s-1). A further absorbance decrease was observed over a period of several minutes; this could be assigned to release of NTA from the complex, as suggested by Honda et al. (1980).},

Given the large portfolio of options, we reviewed and synthesized the existing cost data relevant to current policies to provide context for future policies. We model the expected future costs of different strategies for continued vaccination, surveillance, and other costs that require significant potential resource commitments. We estimate the costs of different potential policy portfolios for low-, middle-, and high-income countries to demonstrate the variability in these costs. We estimate that a global transition from routine immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) would increase the costs of managing polio globally, although routine IPV use remains less costly than routine OPV use with supplemental immunization activities. The costs of surveillance and a stockpile, while small compared to routine vaccination costs, represent important expenditures to ensure adequate response to potential outbreaks. The uncertainty and sensitivity analyses highlight important uncertainty in the aggregated costs and demonstrates that the discount rate and uncertainty in price and administration cost of IPV drives the expected incremental cost of routine IPV vs. OPV immunization.},

  Abstract                 = {Chronic heart failure (CHF) is associated with increased risk of osteoporosis. We investigated the relationship between severity of CHF and bone loss, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and the prognostic significance of bone mass changes in heart failure.Total body (TB) and femoral (F) bone mineral density (BMD), and T- and Z-scores in the femur were measured in 60 men with CHF (56 ± 11 years) and 13 age-matched men free from CHF. The composite study endpoint was death, implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), or inotrope dependency during a median 2-year follow-up. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D were measured in all subjects. TBBMD, FBMD, T-score, and Z-score were significantly lower in men with CHF. Their PTH levels were also significantly increased (111 ± 59 vs. 39 ± 14; P < 0.001). Patients in New York Heart Association classes III-IV compared with those in classes I-II demonstrated significantly lower TBBMD, FBMD, T-score, and Z-score, and higher PTH (136 ± 69 vs. 86 ± 31; P= 0.001). Increased PTH levels were correlated with reduced TBBMD (P = 0.003), FBMD (P = 0.002), and femur T-score (P = 0.001), reduced cardiac index (P = 0.01) and VO(2) peak (P < 0.0001), and increased wedge pressure (P = 0.001). Low TBBMD [hazard ratio (HR) 0.003, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.00-0.58; P = 0.03] and Z-score (HR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.35-0.90; P = 0.017) were associated with adverse outcome.Secondary hyperparathyroidism and reduction in bone density occur in CHF patients and are associated with disease severity. Increased bone mass loss in CHF has prognostic significance.},

  Abstract                 = {Achieving successful eradication of a disease requires global cooperation to obtain a shared goal. Coordination of the endgame may seem an obvious requirement for success, but that does not ensure that cooperation will occur.To analytically explore the need for cooperation to maintain global polio eradication specifically related to creation of a global polio vaccine stockpile and coordination of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation.Using risk and decision analysis and game theoretical concepts, we modeled the importance of global cooperation in managing the risks associated with polioviruses for a time horizon of 20 years after successful global disruption of circulation of wild polioviruses.Countries may wish to avoid the financial costs of vaccination and risks for vaccine-associated paralytic polio following eradication of wild polioviruses, which may lead them to reduce their use of OPV. However, reducing or stopping vaccination too soon and without coordination poses serious risks, including the possibility of reimportation of wild polioviruses and the possibility of vaccine-derived polioviruses. Analysis of the risks for potential outbreaks suggests the need for creation and maintenance of a global stockpile of vaccine for outbreak response. Game theoretical considerations show that coordination of OPV cessation optimizes expected costs and risks globally, despite the potential perceived incentives for countries to stop OPV earlier or later than other countries, or to continue OPV use indefinitely.This article makes the strong case for global cooperation on risk management and suggests that even though individual countries may perceive their own risks as small, risks at the global level warrant cooperative action and coordination of OPV cessation.},

We found cost-effectiveness ratios for switching from OPV to inactivated poliovirus vaccine to be higher (i.e., less desirable) than other health investment opportunities, depending on the actual inactivated poliovirus vaccine costs and assumptions about whether supplemental immunization activities with OPV would continue.Eradication promises billions of dollars of net benefits, although global health policy leaders face difficult choices about future policies.

Partial least squares (PLS) regression has been successfully undertaken to select suitable predictor variables and to identify outliers for the generation of equations for RIF and INH determination in fixed-dose combinations (FDCs). The aim of this investigation was to ascertain the applicability of the described technique in testing a novel oral FDC anti-TB drug delivery system and currently available two-drug FDCs, in comparison to the United States Pharmacopeial method for analysis of RIF and INH Capsules with chromatographic determination of INH and colorimetric RIF determination. Regression equations generated employing the statistical coefficients satisfactorily predicted RIF release at each sampling point (R(2)>or=0.9350). There was an acceptable degree of correlation between the drug release data, as predicted by regressional analysis of UV spectrophotometric data, and chromatographic and colorimetric determination of INH (R(2)=0.9793 and R(2)=0.9739) and RIF (R(2)= 0.9976 and R(2)=0.9996) for the two-drug FDC and the novel oral anti-TB drug delivery system, respectively. Regressional analysis of UV spectrophotometric data for simultaneous RIF and INH prediction thus provides a simplified methodology for use in diverse research settings for the assurance of RIF bioavailability from FDC formulations, specifically modified-release forms.},

  Abstract                 = {This article seeks to advance an understanding of the spatial dynamics of one of the great emergent viral diseases of the twentieth century-poliomyelitis. From an apparently rare clinical condition occurring only sporadically or in small outbreaks before the late nineteenth century, poliomyelitis had, by the early 1950s, developed into a globally distributed epidemic disease. But, from 1955, continued growth was suddenly and dramatically reversed by the mass administration of inactivated (killed) and live (attenuated) poliovirus vaccines. After almost half a century of vaccine control, the world now stands on the brink of the global eradication of the disease. Against this background, the article draws upon information included in the U.S. Public Health Service's Public Health Reports and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report to examine the spatial dynamics of poliomyelitis during the phases of epidemic emergence (1910-1955) and vaccine-induced retreat (1955-1971) in the United States. It is shown that epidemic emergence was accompanied by shifts in the spatial center of activity from early diffusion poles in the northeastern states, to the western seaboard, and then finally to cover all the states of the Union. This was accompanied by accelerating epidemic propagation. The introduction of mass vaccination from the mid-1950s realigned spatial transmission of the disease, producing increased spatial volatility in the geographical center of activity and heightened dependence of epidemic outbreaks upon endemic reservoirs in the most populous states. Finally, the empirical results are generalized to suggest that the emergence and reemergence of many infectious diseases is a distinctively geographical process.},

The WHO requires vaccination for smallpox, cholera and yellow fever, recorded on official WHO forms. Yellow fever vaccinations are good for 10 years, and are only given at special locations. Live viral vaccines (smallpox, yellow fever and polio) should be given 3 weeks apart if possible. Contraindications against receiving these vaccines are listed, along with alternate procedures in such cases. Vaccines in the medically recommended group include typhoid-paratyphoid, tetanus, poliomyelitis, plague, typhus and immunoglobulin for infective hepatitis. A polyvalent vaccine for typhoid, paratyphoid A and B, and tetanus is available. The effectiveness of paratyphoid B vaccine is in dispute, and reactions are troublesome. Tetanus and polio immunizations are a must. Plague and typhus shots often produce reactions, and the immunity is not always good, but injections are highly recommended for those travelling in the interior of affected areas. Rabies vaccination is not recommended unless the traveller is to work as a veterinarian. Measles and BCG are suggested for children who are going to live in endemic areas.},

  Abstract                 = {The long-term persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in communities with high tuberculosis prevalence is a serious problem aggravated by the presence of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains. Drug resistance in an individual patient is often discovered only after a long delay, particularly if the diagnosis is based on current culture-based drug sensitivity testing methods. During such delays, the patient may transmit tuberculosis to his or her contacts. Rapid diagnosis of drug resistance would be expected to reduce this transmission and hence to decrease the prevalence of drug-resistant strains. To investigate this quantitatively, a mathematical model was constructed, assuming a homogeneous population structure typical of communities in South Africa where tuberculosis incidence is high. Computer simulations performed with this model showed that current control strategies will not halt the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in such communities. The simulations showed that the rapid diagnosis of drug resistance can be expected to reduce the incidence of drug-resistant cases provided the additional measure of screening within the community is implemented.},

Herein, we examined the 1889 "Russian" pandemic. Clinical attack rates were retrieved for 408 geographic entities in 14 European countries and in the United States. Case fatality ratios were estimated from datasets in the French, British and German armies, and morbidity and mortality records of Swiss cities. Weekly all-cause mortality was analyzed in 96 European and American cities. The pandemic spread rapidly, taking only 4 months to circumnavigate the planet, peaking in the United States 70 days after the original peak in St. Petersburg. The median and interquartile range of clinical attack rates was 60\% (45-70\%). The case fatality ratios ranged from 0.1\% to 0.28\%, which is comparable to those of 1957 and 1968, and 10-fold lower than in 1918. The median basic reproduction number (R(0)) was 2.1, which is comparable to the values found for the other pandemics, despite the different viruses and contact networks. R(0) values varied widely from one city to another, and only a small minority of those values was within the range in which modelers' mitigation scenarios predicted effectiveness. The 1889 and 1918 R(0) correlated for the subset of cities for which both values were available. Social and geographic factors probably shape the local R(0) , and they could be identified to design optimal mitigation scenarios tailored to each city.},

  Abstract                 = {Serial reconstructions of the membranous bronchioles (MB) were performed in randomly selected tissue blocks cut parallel to the pleural surface in fixated human lungs. Two to four normal, senile, and emphysematous lungs were examined. Three (2 in senile lungs) orders of MB were observed with a dichotomous branching pattern. Emphysematous lungs are characterized by an overall decrease in airway diameter with localized stenoses. Comparison with mean airway diameter (d) and density [n (no. of MBs per cm2 of lung tissue)] of MBs obtained using standard morphometric techniques (random sections approximately 1 cm from the pleura) showed that the values of d and n are biased because of the inclusion in the measurements of a number of respiratory bronchioles and bronchi. When these misclassifications are corrected for, it appears that d corresponds quite well to the mean diameter of the terminal bronchioles (TB) and n to approximately twice the density of TBs. After correction, n is not significantly reduced in emphysematous lungs (the grossly destroyed areas being excluded) compared with normal lungs. The estimate of the number of TBs obtained from the present data is markedly less than that calculated by Weibel (Morphometry of the Human Lung. Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1963), which suggests that the number of bronchi was overestimated by Weibel by at least one generation. Finally, values of peripheral airway resistance computed from the present anatomic data correspond quite well to direct measurement performed on the same lungs before fixation (Verbeken et al., J. Appl. Physiol. 72:2343-2353, 1992).},

Macerated sagittal slices of T12 vertebral bodies from 15 subjects were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two digital images (the second image tilted 5 degrees ) were recorded, and a 3D anaglyph was created. The thickness of the trabecular rods (Tb.Th((rods))), and the anatomical orientation of the trabecular rods were measured using an image analyser. Conventional 2D histomorphometry was performed on adjacent bone slices. A total of 1559 rod measurements were made from the 15 vertebral bone slices, with a mean Tb.Th((rods)) of 123 +/- 36 microm. The rod thickness in males (128 +/- 34 microm) was significantly greater than that in females (119 +/- 37 microm, P < 0.001). Tb.Th((rods)) changed significantly with age in the males: the thicker rods in the younger men reduced with age to a thickness similar to that in women. 3D measurements were significantly larger than the 2D estimates, and there was no correlation between the two methods of measurement. An inverse correlation was found between the number of rods and the bone volume fraction (BV/TV), indicating that decreased BV/TV is associated with an increased number of rods. The vertical rods (132 +/- 39 microm) were significantly thicker than the horizontal rods (116 +/- 33 microm, P < 0.001). The determination of rod numbers, and their orientation and individual thicknesses enables a greater understanding of cancellous bone architecture in both individuals and populations, and will allow more reliable finite element modelling. Direct measurements from 3D anaglyphs of intact specimens provide new data that show previously unrecognised age- and sex-related changes.},

It was classified by WHO as a serious threat to tuberculosis (TB) control, with world-wide consequences, taking on the proportions of a real pandemic in some regions.To compare patients with XDR-TB versus other MDR-TB profiles with regard to epidemiological and demographic characteristics, aetiopathogenic factors and inhospital outcomes.Patients admitted to Pulido Valente Hospital (Pulmonology Service III) in the period ranging from April 1999 to June 2007 with MDR-TB diagnosis microbiologically confirmed. The following variables were evaluated: gender, age, race, forms of TB presentation, treatment groups, resistance profile, immigrant status, number and duration of previous treatments, WHO classification, HIV co-infection, alcoholism and/or drug addiction, average length of hospital stay and inhospital mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences), version 15.0. In categorical variables, the statistical differences between groups were evaluated by the Chi-square test and numeric variables using the T-test. Logistical regression analysis was used to build the predictive model of XDR-TB existence (dependent variable), which included the following independent variables: WHO classification, HIV co-infection, immigrant status, alcoholism and/or drug addiction and number and duration of previous treatments.We recorded 132 patients with MDR-TB, of which 69 (52.3\%) were XDR-TB. Statistically significant differences were observed in the following variables: race (black race was associated with XDRTB in 74\% of cases versus 46\% of the Caucasian race); WHO classification (patients with retreatment for therapeutic failure, stopping treatment or relapse were 69.5\% of XDR-TB cases versus 44.5\% of Not XDR-TB cases; average duration of previous treatments (4.2 months for XDR-TB cases versus 2.8 months for Not XDR-TB cases); HIV co-infection (patients with HIV co-infection constituted 65.2\% of XDR-TB cases versus 42.9\% of Not XDR-TB cases), mortality (33.3\% in patients with XDR-TB versus 14.3\% in Not XDR-TB patients).The variables with predictive value for the diagnosis of XDR-TB vs. Not XDR-TB were presence of HIV co-infection (odds ratio [OR] for XDRTB 2.5; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 - 5.05) and increased average duration of previous treatments ([OR] for XDR-TB 1.2; 95\% [CI], 1.11 - 2.30).},

Little is known about the acceptability and compliance with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine among HCWs during the current campaign. Between 23 December 2009 and 13 January 2010, once the workplace vaccination program was over, we conducted a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey at the University Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain). Five hundred twenty-seven HCWs were asked about their influenza immunization history during the 2009-2010 season, as well as the reasons for accepting or declining either the seasonal or pandemic vaccines. Multiple logistic-regression analysis was preformed to identify variables associated with immunization acceptance. A total of 262 HCWs (49.7\%) reported having received the seasonal vaccine, while only 87 (16.5\%) affirmed having received the pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 vaccine. "Self-protection" and "protection of the patient" were the most frequently adduced reasons for acceptance of the pandemic vaccination, whereas the existence of "doubts about vaccine efficacy" and "fear of adverse reactions" were the main arguments for refusal. Simultaneous receipt of the seasonal vaccine (odds ratio [OR]: 0.27; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: 0.14-0.52) and being a staff (OR: 0.08; 95\% CI: 0.04-0.19) or a resident physician (OR: 0.16; 95\% CI: 0.05-0.50) emerged as independent predictors for pandemic vaccine acceptance, whereas self-reported membership of a priority group was associated with refusal (OR: 5.98; 95\% CI: 1.35-26.5). The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccination coverage among the HCWs in our institution was very low (16.5\%), suggesting the role of specific attitudinal barriers and misconceptions about immunization in a global pandemic scenario.},

If service delivery is of good quality and outreach to the population is active, effective communication--through advocacy, social mobilization, and program communication (including behavior change activities and interpersonal communication)--will assist in raising awareness, creating and sustaining demand, preventing or dispelling misinformation and doubts, encouraging acceptance of and participation in vaccination services, more rapid reporting of disease cases and outbreaks, and mobilizing financial resources to support immunization efforts. There is evidence of 12\% to 20\% or more increases in the absolute level of immunization coverage and 33\% to 100\% increases in relative coverage compared to baselines when communication is included as a key component of immunization strengthening. This article utilizes evidence from Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Nigeria to examine how the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has utilized monitoring and evaluation data to focus and improve the quality and impact of communication activities.},

Five of the identified compounds show significant in vitro activity against H37Rv strains (MICs in the range of 2.5-80 mg/L) and clinical MTB strains, including MDR and XDR isolates. More impressively, compounds 5 and 7 can enhance the killing ability against macrophages infected pathogen remarkably.

TbNi(2)Mn(x) crystallizes in the MgCu(2)-type structure (space group Fd3m). The additional contributions to the magnetic energy terms from transition-metal-transition-metal interactions (T-T) and rare-earth-transition-metal interactions (R-T) in RNi(2)Mn compounds contribute to their increased magnetic ordering temperatures compared with RNi(2) and RMn(2). Both the lattice constant a and the Curie temperature T(C) exhibit maximal values at the x = 1 composition indicating strong magnetostructural coupling. Analyses of the AC magnetic susceptibility and DC magnetization data of TbNi(2)Mn around the Curie temperature T(C) = 147 K confirm that the magnetic transition is second order with critical exponents β = 0.77 ± 0.12, γ = 1.09 ± 0.07 and δ = 2.51 ± 0.06. These exponents establish that the magnetic interactions in TbNi(2)Mn are long range despite mixed occupancies of Tb and Mn atoms at the 8a site and vacancies. The magnetic entropy - ΔS(M) around T(C) is proportional to (μ(0)H/T(C))(2/3) in agreement with the critical magnetic analyses. The Mössbauer spectra above T(C) are fitted by two sub-spectra in agreement with refinement of the x-ray data while below T(C) three sub-spectra are required to represent the three inequivalent local magnetic environments.},

In the present study, we measure hepatic protein synthesis in vivo using a flooding dose of tracer amino acid, and in vitro in hepatocytes freshly isolated from tumor-bearing (TB) and pair-fed control rats. Increased protein synthesis was observed for the TB rats using both methods of analysis. However, the degree of stimulation seen in the TB animals was much greater in the in vitro assay than in the in vivo approach, suggesting that absolute protein synthetic rates in vitro must be interpreted with caution when extrapolating to the in vivo state.},

In addition, 21 "pre-VDPV2" (0.5\%-1.0\% divergent) cases occurred during this period. Both cVDPV and pre-VDPV cases were clinically indistinguishable from cases due to wild poliovirus. The monthly incidence of cases increased sharply in early 2009, as more children aged without trivalent OPV SIAs. Cumulative state incidence of pre-VDPV2/cVDPV2 was correlated with low childhood immunization against poliovirus type 2 assessed by various means. Strengthened routine immunization programs in countries with suboptimal coverage and balanced use of OPV formulations in SIAs are necessary to minimize risks of VDPV emergence and circulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Vaccination rates of children in Germany are unsatisfying and regional endemic outbreaks have been reported. Few studies have analysed physicians' attitude towards vaccination. We investigated whether there is an association between physicians' attitude and vaccination coverage on the regional level for Germany.In a representative cross-sectional survey, anonymized questionnaires were sent to random samples of all paediatricians (50\%) and general practitioners (10\%) in private practice in Germany. Attitude towards vaccination was operationalized in three scores. Measles and pertussis vaccination coverage rates were obtained from the 16 Federal States' Health Departments. Geographic methods and linear regression models were used for analysis.A total of 2010 paediatricians (response proportion: 64.1\%) and 1712 general practitioners (response proportion 39.1\%) were included in the analysis. We found an association of physicians' attitude towards vaccination and vaccination coverage rate (P < 0.0001). There is also an important association between vaccination coverage and the geographic location, with lower coverage rates especially in the States of former Western Germany (compared with our reference State Mecklenburg - Western Pomerania; pertussis: maximum -5.86\% in Bavaria, P < 0.0001; measles: maximum -20.20\% in Berlin, P = 0.0002).The regional association between vaccination coverage rates and physicians' attitude towards vaccination seems to be superposed by population-related variables. An increase of vaccination coverage requires better information and training of both, physicians and the general population.},

  Abstract                 = {Since time immemorial animals have been a major source of human infectious disease. Certain infections like rabies are recognized as zoonoses caused in each case by direct animal-to-human transmission. Others like measles became independently sustained with the human population so that the causative virus has diverged from its animal progenitor. Recent examples of direct zoonoses are variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease arising from bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and the H5N1 avian in£uenza outbreak in Hong Kong. Epidemics of recent animal origin are the 1918-1919 in£uenza pandemic, and acquired immune de¢ciency syndrome caused by human immunodefficiency virus (HIV). Some retroviruses jump into and out of the chromosomal DNA of the host germline, so that they oscillate between being inherited Mendelian traits or infectious agents in di¡erent species. Will new procedures like animal-to-human transplants unleash further infections? Do microbes become more virulent upon cross-species transfer ? Are animal microbes a threat as biological weapons? Will the vast reservoir of immunodefficient hosts due to the HIV pandemic provide conditions permissive for sporadic zoonoses to take off as human-tohuman transmissible diseases ? Do human infections now pose a threat to endangered primates? These questions are addressed in this lecture.}

To minimise turnaround time, rapid DST will need to be prioritised, but developers of these assays will need better data about the molecular mechanisms of resistance. Efforts are underway to link mutations with drug resistance and to develop strain collections to enable assessment of new diagnostic assays. In resource-limited settings, DST might not be appropriate for all patients with tuberculosis. Surveillance data and modelling will help country stakeholders to design appropriate DST algorithms and to decide whether to change drug regimens. Finally, development of practical DST assays is needed so that, in countries where surveillance and modelling show that DST is advisable, these assays can be used to guide clinical decisions for individual patients. If combined judiciously during both development and implementation, new tuberculosis regimens and new DST assays have enormous potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Epidemics of HIV/AIDS have increased the tuberculosis (TB) case-load by five or more times in East Africa and southern Africa. As HIV continues to spread, warnings have been issued of disastrous AIDS and TB epidemics in "new-wave" countries, including India, which accounts for 20\% of all new TB cases arising in the world each year. Here we investigate whether, in the face of the HIV epidemic, India's Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP) could halve TB prevalence and death rates in the period 1990-2015, as specified by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Using a mathematical model to capture the spatial and temporal variation in TB and HIV in India, we predict that, without the RNTCP, HIV would increase TB prevalence (by 1\%), incidence (by 12\%), and mortality rates (by 33\%) between 1990 and 2015. With the RNTCP, however, we expect substantial reductions in prevalence (by 68\%), incidence (by 41\%), and mortality (by 39\%) between 1990 and 2015. In India, 29\% of adults but 72\% of HIV-positive adults live in four large states in the south where, even with the RNTCP, mortality is expected to fall by only 15\% between 1990 and 2015. Nationally, the RNTCP should be able to reverse the increases in TB burden due to HIV but, to ensure that TB mortality is reduced by 50\% or more by 2015, HIV-infected TB patients should be provided with antiretroviral therapy in addition to the recommended treatment for TB.},

  Abstract                 = {HIV has increased the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) by up to sevenfold in African countries, but antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the incidence of AIDS-related TB. We use a mathematical model to investigate the short-term and long-term impacts of ART on the incidence of TB, assuming that people are tested for HIV once a year, on average, and start ART at a fixed time after HIV seroconversion or at a fixed CD4(+) cell count. We fit the model to trend data on HIV prevalence and TB incidence in nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa. If HIV-positive people start ART within 5 y of seroconversion, the incidence of AIDS-related TB in 2015 will be reduced by 48\% (range: 37-55\%). Long-term reductions depend sensitively on the delay to starting ART. If treatment is started 5, 2, or 1 y after HIV seroconversion, or as soon as people test positive, the incidence in 2050 will be reduced by 66\% (range: 57-80\%), 95\% (range: 93-96\%), 97.7\% (range: 96.9-98.2\%) and 98.4\% (range: 97.8-98.9\%), respectively. In the countries considered here, early ART could avert 0.71 ± 0.36 [95\% confidence interval (CI)] million of 3.4 million cases of TB between 2010 and 2015 and 5.8 ± 2.9 (95\% CI) million of 15 million cases between 2015 and 2050. As more countries provide ART at higher CD4(+) cell counts, the impact on TB should be investigated to test the predictions of this model.},

  Abstract                 = {The variability in CD4+ cell counts within and among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and -negative African populations has not been explained but has important implications for understanding the incidence of HIV-related opportunistic infections, especially tuberculosis, in both individuals and populations.In HIV-negative African adults, CD4+ cell counts vary within populations (interquartile ranges [IQRs], 169-603 cells/microL) and among populations (means vary from 699 to 1244 cells/microL), with similarly wide variations in HIV-positive adults. We developed dynamic mathematical models to predict the distribution of CD4+ cell counts in HIV-positive adults using the distribution in HIV-negative adults.Under the assumption that survival is independent of the CD4+ cell count before seroconversion, we fitted the observed distributions in HIV-positive adults. At a CD4+ cell count of 200 cells/microL, the median life expectancy of HIV-positive Zambians (4.0 years) was predicted to be 1.7 times that of HIV-positive South Africans (2.3 years).The model provides a way to estimate the changing distribution of CD4+ cell counts and, hence, the changing incidence of HIV-related opportunistic infections as the epidemic matures. This could substantially improve the planning of health services, including the need and demand for antiretroviral therapy. Better data are needed to test the model and its assumptions more rigorously and to fully understand the variability in CD4+ cell counts within and among populations.},

Mixing of bilayer lipids was monitored with an assay based on resonance energy transfer (RET) and mixing of aqueous vesicle contents with the Tb/dipicolinate assay. The results obtained with either assay were analyzed in terms of a mass action kinetic model, providing separate rate constants for vesicle aggregation and for the fusion reaction proper. At different Ca2+ concentrations, either at 25 degrees C or at 37 degrees C, aggregation rate constants derived from the data obtained with the RET assay were the same as those derived from the Tb/dipicolinate data, indicating that mixing of bilayer lipids occurred only during vesicle aggregation events that resulted in mixing of aqueous contents as well. At 25 degrees C, identical fusion rate constants were obtained with either assay, indicating that at this temperature the probability of lipid mixing and that of aqueous contents mixing, occurring after vesicle aggregation, were the same. The fusion rate constants for the RET assay increased more steeply with increasing temperature than the fusion rate constants derived from the Tb/dipicolinate data. As a result, at 37 degrees C the tendency of the vesicles, after aggregation, to mix lipids was slightly higher than their tendency to mix aqueous contents. The aggregation rate constants increased steeply with Ca2+ concentrations increasing in a narrow range (9.5-11 mM), indicating that, in addition to a Ca2+-dependent charge neutralization on the vesicle surface, structural changes in the lipid bilayer are involved in the aggregation process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Separate rate constants for vesicle aggregation as well as deaggregation and for the fusion reaction itself were determined by analysis of the data in terms of a mass action kinetic model. At 15 degrees C the aggregation rate constants for either assay are the same, indicating that at this temperature all vesicle aggregation events that result in lipid mixing lead to mixing of aqueous contents as well. By contrast, at 35 degrees C the RET aggregation rate constants are higher than the Tb/DPA aggregation rate constants, indicating a significant frequency of reversible vesicle aggregation events that do result in mixing of bilayer lipids, but not in mixing of aqueous vesicle contents. In any conditions, the RET fusion rate constants are considerably higher than the Tb/DPA fusion rate constants, demonstrating the higher tendency of the vesicles, once aggregated, to mix lipids than to mix aqueous contents. This possibly reflects the formation of an intermediate fusion structure. With increasing Ca2+ concentrations the RET and the Tb/DPA fusion rate constants increase in parallel with the respective aggregation rate constants. This suggests that fusion susceptibility is conferred on the vesicles during the process of vesicle aggregation and not solely as a result of the interaction of Ca2+ with isolated vesicles. Aggregation of the vesicles in the presence of Mg2+ produces neither mixing of aqueous vesicle contents nor mixing of bilayer lipids.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied the 75-225 msec portion of the auditory evoked response (AER) in 32 normal adults at vertex (Cz) and temporal (T3 and T4) placements referred to a balanced, noncephalic reference electrode using a monaural 1 msec click stimulus delivered every 4.7 sec at 60 dB above threshold. The tape-recorded EEG was filtered at 1-25 c/sec, and 128 individual responses were summed, sampling every 0.5 msec for 250 msec post-stimulation. The Cz AERs showed the classic vertex response, a negative peak, N1, at 100 msec, followed by a positive peak, P2, at 160-200 msec. The T3 and T4 AERs were similar to the Cz AERs from 0 to 80 msec and from 200 to 250 msec. They differed significantly from the Cz AERs from 80 to 200 msec. The difference is best explained by the hypothesis that the Cz AERs consisted of N1P2, while the T3 and T4 AERs consisted of N1P2 plus an additional superimposed component, which we called the T complex, comprising a positive peak, Ta, at 105-110 msec, and a negative peak, Tb, at 150-160 msec. By computer, the corresponding Cz and T3 or T4 AERs were normalized to equalize their amplitudes, and the former was subtracted from the latter, thus isolating the T complex. The Ta peak was found to occur 1.5 +/- 1.6 msec earlier at the electrode contralateral to stimulation, and 2.2 +/- 4.0 msec earlier at the T4 (right) electrode. Both differences were statistically significant. The T complex amplitude was greater at the electrode contralateral to stimulation and at the T4 electrode. These findings appear to resolve current controversies concerning the form of the temporal AER. While N1P2 is apparently a product of widespread areas of cortex, we conclude that the T complex is probably a product of secondary auditory cortex.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the first reports of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria in southeast Asia and South America almost half a century ago, drug-resistant malaria has posed a major problem in malaria control. By the late 1980s, resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and to mefloquine was also prevalent on the Thai-Cambodian and Thai-Myanmar (Thai-Burmese) borders, rendering them established multidrug-resistant (MDR) areas. Chloroquine resistance spread across Africa during the 1980s, and severe resistance is especially found in east Africa. As a result, more than ten African countries have switched their first-line drug to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Of great concern is the fact that the efficacy of this drug in Africa is progressively deteriorating, especially in foci in east Africa, which are classified as emerging MDR areas. Urgent efforts are needed to lengthen the lifespan of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and to identify effective, affordable, alternative antimalarial regimens. Molecular markers for antimalarial resistance have been identified, including pfcrt polymorphisms associated with chloroquine resistance and dhfr and dhps polymorphisms associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. Polymorphisms in pfmdr1 may also be associated with resistance to chloroquine, mefloquine, quinine, and artemisinin. Use of such genetic information for the early detection of resistance foci and future monitoring of drug-resistant malaria is a potentially useful epidemiological tool, in conjunction with the conventional in-vivo and in-vitro drug-sensitivity assessments. This review describes the various features of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, including its determinants, current status in diverse geographical areas, molecular markers, and their implications.},

  Abstract                 = {The Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance has been gathering data since 1994. This study provides the latest data on the extent of drug resistance worldwide.Data for drug susceptibility were gathered from 90 726 patients in 83 countries and territories between 2002 and 2007. Standardised collection of results enabled comparison both between and within countries. Where possible, data for HIV status and resistance to second-line drugs were also obtained. Laboratory data were quality assured by the Supranational Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory Network.The median prevalence of resistance to any drug in new cases of tuberculosis was 11.1\% (IQR 7.0-22.3). The prevalence of multidrug resistance in new tuberculosis cases ranged from 0\% in eight countries to 7\% in two provinces in China, 11.1\% in Northern Mariana Islands (although reporting only two cases), and between 6.8\% and 22.3\% in nine countries of the former Soviet Union, including 19.4\% in Moldova and 22.3\% in Baku, Azerbaijan (median for countries surveyed 1.6\%, IQR 0.6-3.9). Trend analysis showed that between 1994 and 2007, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in new cases increased substantially in South Korea and in Tomsk Oblast and Orel Oblast, Russia, but was stable in Estonia and Latvia. The prevalence of MDR tuberculosis in all tuberculosis cases decreased in Hong Kong and the USA. 37 countries and territories reported representative data on extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. Five countries, all from the former Soviet Union, reported 25 cases or more of XDR tuberculosis each, with prevalence among MDR-tuberculosis cases ranging between 6.6\% and 23.7\%.MDR tuberculosis remains a threat to tuberculosis control in provinces in China and countries of the former Soviet Union. Data on drug resistance are unavailable in many countries, especially in Africa, emphasising the need to develop easier methods for surveillance of resistance in tuberculosis.Global Project: United States Agency for International Development and Eli Lilly and Company.

  Abstract                 = {The global tuberculosis (TB) control plan has historically emphasized passive case finding (PCF) as the most practical approach for identifying TB suspects in high burden settings. The success of this approach in controlling TB depends on infectious individuals recognizing their symptoms and voluntarily seeking diagnosis rapidly enough to reduce onward transmission. It now appears, at least in some settings, that more intensified case-finding (ICF) approaches may be needed to control TB transmission; these more aggressive approaches for detecting as-yet undiagnosed cases obviously require additional resources to implement. Given that TB control programs are resource constrained and that the incremental yield of ICF is expected to wane over time as the pool of undiagnosed cases is depleted, a tool that can help policymakers to identify when to implement or suspend an ICF intervention would be valuable. In this article, we propose dynamic case-finding policies that allow policymakers to use existing observations about the epidemic and resource availability to determine when to switch between PCF and ICF to efficiently use resources to optimize population health. Using mathematical models of TB/HIV coepidemics, we show that dynamic policies strictly dominate static policies that prespecify a frequency and duration of rounds of ICF. We also find that the use of a diagnostic tool with better sensitivity for detecting smear-negative cases (e.g., Xpert MTB/RIF) further improves the incremental benefit of these dynamic case-finding policies.},

  Abstract                 = {The enterohepatic circulation of cefixime in rat was evaluated by a nonlinear least square analysis program, MULTI(FILT), into which the fast inverse Laplace transform (FILT) was incorporated. The plasma time course in the bile duct-cannulated rat exhibited a biexponential curve after the rapid iv administration of cefixime. Several pharmacokinetic models for the enterohepatic circulation were constructed based on the recirculatory concept and the Laplace-transformed equations corresponding to these models were derived by means of the method of transfer function. The transformed equations were simultaneously fitted to the time courses of plasma concentration in rats with laparotomy and with bile duct cannula. The optimum model was selected based on the Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The local moment characteristics for a single pass through enterohepatic circulation were further calculated from the time courses of both the plasma concentration and the amount excreted into the bile. The recovery ratio (Fc) and the mean circulatory time (-tc) through a single pass of enterohepatic circulation were estimated 27.9\% and 1.07 hr, respectively. The recovery ratio (Fa) and the mean absorption time (-tc) for the absorption process from the intestinal tract into the systemic circulation were 68.3\% and 0.0234 hr, respectively. The recovery ratio (Fb) and the mean transit time (-tb) for the disposition process through the systemic circulation into the bile were 40.8\% and 1.05 hr, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {There is mounting evidence that the aerosol transmission route plays a significant role in the spread of influenza in temperate regions and that the efficiency of this route depends on humidity. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms by which humidity might influence transmissibility via the aerosol route have not been elucidated. We hypothesize that airborne concentrations of infectious influenza A viruses (IAVs) vary with humidity through its influence on virus inactivation rate and respiratory droplet size. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which humidity might influence aerosol transmission, we modeled the size distribution and dynamics of IAVs emitted from a cough in typical residential and public settings over a relative humidity (RH) range of 10-90\%. The model incorporates the size transformation of virus-containing droplets due to evaporation and then removal by gravitational settling, ventilation, and virus inactivation. The predicted concentration of infectious IAVs in air is 2.4 times higher at 10\% RH than at 90\% RH after 10 min in a residential setting, and this ratio grows over time. Settling is important for removal of large droplets containing large amounts of IAVs, while ventilation and inactivation are relatively more important for removal of IAVs associated with droplets <5 µm. The inactivation rate increases linearly with RH; at the highest RH, inactivation can remove up to 28\% of IAVs in 10 min. Humidity is an important variable in aerosol transmission of IAVs because it both induces droplet size transformation and affects IAV inactivation rates. Our model advances a mechanistic understanding of the aerosol transmission route, and results complement recent studies on the relationship between humidity and influenza's seasonality. Maintaining a high indoor RH and ventilation rate may help reduce chances of IAV infection.},

  Abstract                 = {International travel is a potential risk factor for the spread of influenza. In the United States, approximately 5\%-20\% of the population develops an influenza-like illness annually. The purpose of this study was to describe the knowledge, attitude, and practices of US travelers to Asia regarding seasonal influenza and H5N1 avian influenza (AI) prevention measures.We surveyed travelers to Asia waiting at the departure lounges of 38 selected flights at four international airports in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Of the 1,301 travelers who completed the pre-travel survey, 337 also completed a post-travel survey. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate prevalence odds ratios (with 95\% CI) to compare foreign-born (FB) to US-born travelers for various levels of knowledge and behaviors.Although the majority of participants were aware of influenza prevention measures, only 41\% reported receiving the influenza vaccine during the previous season. Forty-three percent of participants reported seeking at least one type of pre-travel health advice, which was significantly higher among US-born, Caucasians, traveling for purposes other than visiting friends and relatives, travelers who received the influenza vaccine during the previous season, and those traveling with a companion. Our study also showed that Asians, FB travelers, and those working in occupations other than health care/animal care were less likely to recognize H5N1 AI transmission risk factors.The basic public health messages for preventing influenza appear to be well understood, but the uptake of influenza vaccine was low. Clinicians should ensure that all patients receive influenza vaccine prior to travel. Tailored communication messages should be developed to motivate Asians, FB travelers, those visiting friends and relatives, and those traveling alone to seek pre-travel health advice as well as to orient them with H5N1 AI risk factors.},

Particularly in cases caused by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii, combination regimens must also be taken into consideration. In this study, the efficacies of tigecycline, colistin and tigecycline/colistin combination on bacterial counts in lung tissue were investigated in a rat pneumonia model. One A. baumannii strain resistant to all antimicrobial agents except tigecycline and colistin was selected for the study. In vivo studies revealed a >3 log reduction in bacterial counts in the tigecycline, colistin and combination groups at 24 h and 48 h compared with the control group. No significant differences were determined between colistin, tigecycline and combination groups (P>0.05). On the other hand, differences between treatment groups and the control group were statistically significant (P=0.01). A greater reduction in bacterial counts was observed at 48 h compared with 24 h in the tigecycline group than in the colistin group (P=0.038 and P=0.139, respectively); the most significant decrease between 24 h and 48 h was observed in the combination group (P=0.014). Despite detection of in vitro synergistic activity in this study, no statistically significant differences were found between colistin, tigecycline and combination treatments in terms of efficacy on bacterial counts in lung tissue. In the treatment of infections with a high mortality rate such as pneumonia caused by XDR A. baumannii, combining tigecycline with colistin during the first 48 h and continuing treatment with one of these agents seems a rational approach.},

AZT was used as a model drug water-soluble at therapeutic doses. The floating gastroretentive system was obtained by co-precipitation, after solvent diffusion and evaporation. The proposed system was evaluated in vitro for particle morphology, lag time and floating time, loading rate, release profile, and the release kinetic of AZT release. AZT's physico-chemical characteristics were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XDR) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). The particles obtained were sphere-shaped, hollow, and had porous walls. The floating was immediate, and floating time was higher than 12 h. The loading rate was 34.0 ± 9.0\%. The system obtained had an extended release. DSC and XDR results showed a modification in AZT's solid state. IR spectroscopy revealed that the chemical structure of the AZT was unchanged. The hollow microballoons presented gastroretentive, floating, and extended-release properties.},

  Abstract                 = {The scarcity of grafts available necessitates a system that considers expected posttransplant survival, in addition to pretransplant mortality as estimated by the MELD. So far, however, conventional linear techniques have failed to achieve sufficient accuracy in posttransplant outcome prediction. In this study, we aim to develop a pretransplant predictive model for liver recipients' survival with benign end-stage liver diseases (BESLD) by a nonlinear method based on pretransplant characteristics, and compare its performance with a BESLD-specific prognostic model (MELD) and a general-illness severity model (the sequential organ failure assessment score, or SOFA score).With retrospectively collected data on 360 recipients receiving deceased-donor transplantation for BESLD between February 1999 and August 2009 in the west China hospital of Sichuan university, we developed a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to predict one-year and two-year survival probability after transplantation. The performances of the MLP, SOFA, and MELD were assessed by measuring both calibration ability and discriminative power, with Hosmer-Lemeshow test and receiver operating characteristic analysis, respectively. By the forward stepwise selection, donor age and BMI; serum concentration of HB, Crea, ALB, TB, ALT, INR, Na(+); presence of pretransplant diabetes; dialysis prior to transplantation, and microbiologically proven sepsis were identified to be the optimal input features. The MLP, employing 18 input neurons and 12 hidden neurons, yielded high predictive accuracy, with c-statistic of 0.91 (P<0.001) in one-year and 0.88 (P<0.001) in two-year prediction. The performances of SOFA and MELD were fairly poor in prognostic assessment, with c-statistics of 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, in one-year prediction, and 0.67 and 0.65 in two-year prediction.The posttransplant prognosis is a multidimensional nonlinear problem, and the MLP can achieve significantly high accuracy than SOFA and MELD scores in posttransplant survival prediction. The pattern recognition methodologies like MLP hold promise for solving posttransplant outcome prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) is an emerging global health threat. Proper management of close contacts of infectious patients is increasingly important. However, no evidence-based recommendations for treating latent TB infection (LTBI) after MDR/XDR-TB exposure (DR-LTBI) exist. An ultrashort regimen for LTBI caused by drug-susceptible strains (DS-LTBI) is also desirable. TMC207 has bactericidal and sterilizing activity in animal models of TB and improves the activity of current MDR-TB therapy in patients.The objective of this study was to determine whether TMC207 might enable short-course treatment of DR-LTBI and ultrashort treatment of DS-LTBI.Using an established experimental model of LTBI chemotherapy in which mice are aerosol-immunized with a recombinant bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine before low-dose aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the efficacy of TMC207 alone and in combination with rifapentine was compared with currently recommended control regimens as well as once-weekly rifapentine + isoniazid and daily rifapentine ± isoniazid.Outcomes included monthly lung colony-forming unit counts and relapse rates.Lung colony-forming unit counts were stable at about 3.75 log(10) for up to 7.5 months postinfection in untreated mice. Rifamycin-containing regimens were superior to isoniazid monotherapy. TMC207 exhibited sterilizing activity at least as strong as that of rifampin alone and similar to that of rifampin + isoniazid, but daily rifapentine +/- isoniazid was superior to TMC207. Addition of TMC207 to rifapentine did not improve the sterilizing activity of rifapentine in this model.TMC207 has substantial sterilizing activity and may enable treatment of DR-LTBI in 3-4 months.},

  Abstract                 = {Tuberculosis was declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1993. Following the declaration and the promotion in 1995 of directly observed treatment short course (DOTS), a cost-effective strategy to contain the tuberculosis epidemic, nearly 7 million lives have been saved compared with the pre-DOTS era, high cure rates have been achieved in most countries worldwide, and the global incidence of tuberculosis has been in a slow decline since the early 2000s. However, the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, and more recently, totally drug-resistant tuberculosis pose a threat to global tuberculosis control. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a man-made problem. Laboratory facilities for drug susceptibility testing are inadequate in most tuberculosis-endemic countries, especially in Africa; thus diagnosis is missed, routine surveillance is not implemented, and the actual numbers of global drug-resistant tuberculosis cases have yet to be estimated. This exposes an ominous situation and reveals an urgent need for commitment by national programs to health system improvement because the response to MDR tuberculosis requires strong health services in general. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and XDR tuberculosis greatly complicate patient management within resource-poor national tuberculosis programs, reducing treatment efficacy and increasing the cost of treatment to the extent that it could bankrupt healthcare financing in tuberculosis-endemic areas. Why, despite nearly 20 years of WHO-promoted activity and >12 years of MDR tuberculosis-specific activity, has the country response to the drug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic been so ineffectual? The current dilemmas, unanswered questions, operational issues, challenges, and priority needs for global drug resistance screening and surveillance, improved treatment regimens, and management of outcomes and prevention of DR tuberculosis are discussed.},

  abstract        = {Estimates of influenza-associated mortality are important for national and international decision making on public health priorities. Previous estimates of 250 000-500 000 annual influenza deaths are outdated. We updated the estimated number of global annual influenza-associated respiratory deaths using country-specific influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality estimates from 1999-2015. We estimated country-specific influenza-associated respiratory excess mortality rates (EMR) for 33 countries using time series log-linear regression models with vital death records and influenza surveillance data. To extrapolate estimates to countries without data, we divided countries into three analytic divisions for three age groups (<65 years, 65-74 years, and ≥75 years) using WHO Global Health Estimate (GHE) respiratory infection mortality rates. We calculated mortality rate ratios (MRR) to account for differences in risk of influenza death across countries by comparing GHE respiratory infection mortality rates from countries without EMR estimates with those with estimates. To calculate death estimates for individual countries within each age-specific analytic division, we multiplied randomly selected mean annual EMRs by the country's MRR and population. Global 95% credible interval (CrI) estimates were obtained from the posterior distribution of the sum of country-specific estimates to represent the range of possible influenza-associated deaths in a season or year. We calculated influenza-associated deaths for children younger than 5 years for 92 countries with high rates of mortality due to respiratory infection using the same methods. EMR-contributing countries represented 57% of the global population. The estimated mean annual influenza-associated respiratory EMR ranged from 0·1 to 6·4 per 100 000 individuals for people younger than 65 years, 2·9 to 44·0 per 100 000 individuals for people aged between 65 and 74 years, and 17·9 to 223·5 per 100 000 for people older than 75 years. We estimated that 291 243-645 832 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths (4·0-8·8 per 100 000 individuals) occur annually. The highest mortality rates were estimated in sub-Saharan Africa (2·8-16·5 per 100 000 individuals), southeast Asia (3·5-9·2 per 100 000 individuals), and among people aged 75 years or older (51·3-99·4 per 100 000 individuals). For 92 countries, we estimated that among children younger than 5 years, 9243-105 690 influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually. These global influenza-associated respiratory mortality estimates are higher than previously reported, suggesting that previous estimates might have underestimated disease burden. The contribution of non-respiratory causes of death to global influenza-associated mortality should be investigated. None.},

  abstract        = {Until recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the annual mortality burden of influenza to be 250 000 to 500 000 all-cause deaths globally; however, a 2017 study indicated a substantially higher mortality burden, at 290 000-650 000 influenza-associated deaths from respiratory causes alone, and a 2019 study estimated 99 000-200 000 deaths from lower respiratory tract infections directly caused by influenza. Here we revisit global and regional estimates of influenza mortality burden and explore mortality trends over time and geography. We compiled influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality estimates for 31 countries representing 5 WHO regions during 2002-2011. From these we extrapolated the influenza burden for all 193 countries of the world using a multiple imputation approach. We then used mixed linear regression models to identify factors associated with high seasonal influenza mortality burden, including influenza types and subtypes, health care and socio-demographic development indicators, and baseline mortality levels. We estimated an average of 389 000 (uncertainty range 294 000-518 000) respiratory deaths were associated with influenza globally each year during the study period, corresponding to ~ 2% of all annual respiratory deaths. Of these, 67% were among people 65 years and older. Global burden estimates were robust to the choice of countries included in the extrapolation model. For people <65 years, higher baseline respiratory mortality, lower level of access to health care and seasons dominated by the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype were associated with higher influenza-associated mortality, while lower level of socio-demographic development and A(H3N2) dominance was associated with higher influenza mortality in adults ≥65 years. Our global estimate of influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality is consistent with the 2017 estimate, despite a different modelling strategy, and the lower 2019 estimate which only captured deaths directly caused by influenza. Our finding that baseline respiratory mortality and access to health care are associated with influenza-related mortality in persons <65 years suggests that health care improvements in low and middle-income countries might substantially reduce seasonal influenza mortality. Our estimates add to the body of evidence on the variation in influenza burden over time and geography, and begin to address the relationship between influenza-associated mortality, health and development.},

  abstract        = {Seasonal influenza virus is a common cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in young children. In 2008, we estimated that 20 million influenza-virus-associated ALRI and 1 million influenza-virus-associated severe ALRI occurred in children under 5 years globally. Despite this substantial burden, only a few low-income and middle-income countries have adopted routine influenza vaccination policies for children and, where present, these have achieved only low or unknown levels of vaccine uptake. Moreover, the influenza burden might have changed due to the emergence and circulation of influenza A/H1N1pdm09. We aimed to incorporate new data to update estimates of the global number of cases, hospital admissions, and mortality from influenza-virus-associated respiratory infections in children under 5 years in 2018. We estimated the regional and global burden of influenza-associated respiratory infections in children under 5 years from a systematic review of 100 studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2018, and a further 57 high-quality unpublished studies. We adapted the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the risk of bias. We estimated incidence and hospitalisation rates of influenza-virus-associated respiratory infections by severity, case ascertainment, region, and age. We estimated in-hospital deaths from influenza virus ALRI by combining hospital admissions and in-hospital case-fatality ratios of influenza virus ALRI. We estimated the upper bound of influenza virus-associated ALRI deaths based on the number of in-hospital deaths, US paediatric influenza-associated death data, and population-based childhood all-cause pneumonia mortality data in six sites in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. In 2018, among children under 5 years globally, there were an estimated 109·5 million influenza virus episodes (uncertainty range [UR] 63·1-190·6), 10·1 million influenza-virus-associated ALRI cases (6·8-15·1); 870 000 influenza-virus-associated ALRI hospital admissions (543 000-1 415 000), 15 300 in-hospital deaths (5800-43 800), and up to 34 800 (13 200-97 200) overall influenza-virus-associated ALRI deaths. Influenza virus accounted for 7% of ALRI cases, 5% of ALRI hospital admissions, and 4% of ALRI deaths in children under 5 years. About 23% of the hospital admissions and 36% of the in-hospital deaths were in infants under 6 months. About 82% of the in-hospital deaths occurred in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. A large proportion of the influenza-associated burden occurs among young infants and in low-income and lower middle-income countries. Our findings provide new and important evidence for maternal and paediatric influenza immunisation, and should inform future immunisation policy particularly in low-income and middle-income countries.
