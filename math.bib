  abstract    = {The tau-leaping method of simulating the stochastic time evolution of a well-stirred chemically reacting system uses a Poisson approximation to take time steps that leap over many reaction events. Theory implies that tau leaping should be accurate so long as no propensity function changes its value "significantly" during any time step tau. Presented here is an improved procedure for estimating the largest value for tau that is consistent with this condition. This new tau-selection procedure is more accurate, easier to code, and faster to execute than the currently used procedure. The speedup in execution will be especially pronounced in systems that have many reaction channels.},

Further, an adaptive strategy that identifies stiffness and automatically chooses between the explicit and the (new) implicit tau-selection methods to achieve better efficiency is proposed. Numerical testing demonstrates the advantages of the adaptive method for stiff systems.},

  abstract    = {The enzyme-catalyzed conversion of a substrate into a product is a common reaction motif in cellular chemical systems. In the three reactions that comprise this process, the intermediate enzyme-substrate complex is usually much more likely to decay into its original constituents than to produce a product molecule. This condition makes the reaction set mathematically "stiff." We show here how the simulation of this stiff reaction set can be dramatically speeded up relative to the standard stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) by using a recently introduced procedure called the slow-scale SSA. The speedup occurs because the slow-scale SSA explicitly simulates only the relatively rare conversion reactions, skipping over occurrences of the other two less interesting but much more frequent reactions. We describe, explain, and illustrate this simulation procedure for the isolated enzyme-substrate reaction set, and then we show how the procedure extends to the more typical case in which the enzyme-substrate reactions occur together with other reactions and species. Finally, we explain the connection between this slow-scale SSA approach and the Michaelis-Menten [Biochem. Z. 49, 333 (1913)] formula, which has long been used in deterministic chemical kinetics to describe the enzyme-substrate reaction.},

  abstract    = {The explicit tau-leaping procedure attempts to speed up the stochastic simulation of a chemically reacting system by approximating the number of firings of each reaction channel during a chosen time increment tau as a Poisson random variable. Since the Poisson random variable can have arbitrarily large sample values, there is always the possibility that this procedure will cause one or more reaction channels to fire so many times during tau that the population of some reactant species will be driven negative. Two recent papers have shown how that unacceptable occurrence can be avoided by replacing the Poisson random variables with binomial random variables, whose values are naturally bounded. This paper describes a modified Poisson tau-leaping procedure that also avoids negative populations, but is easier to implement than the binomial procedure. The new Poisson procedure also introduces a second control parameter, whose value essentially dials the procedure from the original Poisson tau-leaping at one extreme to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm at the other; therefore, the modified Poisson procedure will generally be more accurate than the original Poisson procedure.},

  abstract    = {Reactions in real chemical systems often take place on vastly different time scales, with "fast" reaction channels firing very much more frequently than "slow" ones. These firings will be interdependent if, as is usually the case, the fast and slow reactions involve some of the same species. An exact stochastic simulation of such a system will necessarily spend most of its time simulating the more numerous fast reaction events. This is a frustratingly inefficient allocation of computational effort when dynamical stiffness is present, since in that case a fast reaction event will be of much less importance to the system's evolution than will a slow reaction event. For such situations, this paper develops a systematic approximate theory that allows one to stochastically advance the system in time by simulating the firings of only the slow reaction events. Developing an effective strategy to implement this theory poses some challenges, but as is illustrated here for two simple systems, when those challenges can be overcome, very substantial increases in simulation speed can be realized.},

Based on careful timing studies and an analysis of the time-consuming operations, we conclude that for most practical problems the optimized direct method is the most efficient formulation of SSA. This is in contrast to the widely held belief that Gibson and Bruck's next reaction method [M. Gibson and J. Bruck, J. Phys. Chem. A 104, 1876 (2000)] is the best way to implement the SSA for large systems. Our analysis explains the source of the discrepancy.},

Because blockers of glutamate receptors reliably reduce pain behaviour, it is assumed that 'pain' messages are mediated by glutamate action on dorsal horn neurons. The contribution of substance P, however, is still unclear. We have now disrupted the mouse preprotachykinin A gene (PPT-A), which encodes substance P and a related tachykinin, neurokinin A. We find that although the behavioural response to mildly painful stimuli is intact in these mice, the response to moderate to intense pain is significantly reduced. Neurogenic inflammation, which results from peripheral release of substance P and neurokinin A, is almost absent in the mutant mice. We conclude that the release of tachykinins from primary afferent pain-sensing receptors (nociceptors) is required to produce moderate to intense pain.},

The advantages and disadvantages of replacing this reaction set with a single S(3)-producing reaction are analyzed quantitatively using novel criteria for measuring simulation accuracy and simulation efficiency.
