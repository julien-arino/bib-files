		  Phys. 81, 2340 (1977)] for exact stochastic simulation of

		  easy to implement but requires large computation for

		  (ODM) [Y. Cao et al., J. Chem. Phys. 121, 4059 (2004)],
		  have been developed to improve simulation speed. It has

		  efficient method for exact stochastic simulation of most
		  practical reaction systems. In this paper, we first develop
		  an exact stochastic simulation algorithm named ODMK that is
		  more efficient than the ODM. We then develop an approximate
		  method named K-skip method to further accelerate
		  simulation. Using two chemical reaction systems, we
		  demonstrate that our ODMK and K-skip method can save
		  20\%-30\% and 70\%-80\% simulation time, respectively,
		  comparing to the ODM. We also show that our ODMK and K-skip
		  method provide almost the same simulation accuracy as the

  abstract	= {The enzyme-catalyzed conversion of a substrate into a
		  product is a common reaction motif in cellular chemical
		  systems. In the three reactions that comprise this process,
		  the intermediate enzyme-substrate complex is usually much
		  more likely to decay into its original constituents than to
		  produce a product molecule. This condition makes the
		  reaction set mathematically "stiff." We show here how the
		  simulation of this stiff reaction set can be dramatically
		  speeded up relative to the standard stochastic simulation
		  algorithm (SSA) by using a recently introduced procedure
		  called the slow-scale SSA. The speedup occurs because the
		  slow-scale SSA explicitly simulates only the relatively
		  rare conversion reactions, skipping over occurrences of the
		  other two less interesting but much more frequent
		  reactions. We describe, explain, and illustrate this
		  simulation procedure for the isolated enzyme-substrate
		  reaction set, and then we show how the procedure extends to
		  the more typical case in which the enzyme-substrate
		  reactions occur together with other reactions and species.
		  Finally, we explain the connection between this slow-scale
		  SSA approach and the Michaelis-Menten [Biochem. Z. 49, 333
		  (1913)] formula, which has long been used in deterministic
		  chemical kinetics to describe the enzyme-substrate

		  affects the spreading speed of a single population and its

		  that density-dependent dispersal probability can act as a
		  mechanism for coexistence of otherwise non-coexisting
		  competitors. We show that in time-varying habitats, an
		  intermediate dispersal probability will evolve.
		  Analytically, we find that the spreading speed for the
		  integrodifference equation with density-dependent dispersal
		  probability is not linearly determined. Furthermore, the
		  next-generation operator is not compact and, in general,
		  neither order-preserving nor monotonicity-preserving. We
		  give two explicit examples of non-monotone, discontinuous

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of localization of the spectra of Laplacian matrices. An expression was obtained for the solution of the Krein equation. This expression generalizes the previously result obtained for the Lyapunov equation with a simple matrix. A condition of belonging of the spectrum of Laplacian matrices to region bounded by an ellipse is also obtained.},

  abstract      = {This paper considers inhomogeneous Erdős–Rényi random graphs [Formula: see text] on [Formula: see text] vertices in the non-sparse non-dense regime. The edge between the pair of vertices [Formula: see text] is retained with probability [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], independently of other edges, where [Formula: see text] is a continuous function such that [Formula: see text] for all [Formula: see text]. We study the empirical distribution of both the adjacency matrix [Formula: see text] and the Laplacian matrix [Formula: see text] associated with [Formula: see text], in the limit as [Formula: see text] when [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. In particular, we show that the empirical spectral distributions of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], after appropriate scaling and centering, converge to deterministic limits weakly in probability. For the special case where [Formula: see text] with [Formula: see text] a continuous function, we give an explicit characterization of the limiting distributions. Furthermore, we apply our results to constrained random graphs, Chung–Lu random graphs and social networks.},

  abstract      = {Abstract We study the sets of inertias achieved by Laplacian matrices of weighted signed graphs. First we characterize signed graphs with a unique Laplacian inertia. Then we show that there is a sufficiently small perturbation of the nonzero weights on the edges of any connected weighted signed graph so that all eigenvalues of its Laplacian matrix are simple. Next, we give upper bounds on the number of possible Laplacian inertias for signed graphs with a fixed flexibility τ (a combinatorial parameter of signed graphs), and show that these bounds are sharp for an infinite family of signed graphs. Finally, we provide upper bounds for the number of possible Laplacian inertias of signed graphs in terms of the number of vertices.},
