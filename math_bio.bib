  abstract	= {One of the most crucial tasks faced by biologists today is
		  revealing the mechanisms which account for biodiversity,
		  yet we are still far from a full understanding of these
		  mechanisms, and in particular the role of spatially
		  heterogeneous population distributions. Recently, the
		  spatially heterogeneous coexistence seen in cyclic
		  competition models—in which species compete as in the
		  game rock-paper-scissors—has brought them to the fore as
		  a paradigm for biodiversity. Research into cyclic
		  competition has so far been focused almost exclusively on
		  stochastic lattice models with discrete space, which ignore
		  several key dynamical aspects. In particular, such models
		  usually assume that species disperse at the same speed.
		  This paper aims to extend our understanding of cyclic
		  competition by applying a reaction–diffusion
		  Lotka–Volterra scheme to the problem, which allows us to
		  vary the mobility of each species, and lets us take into
		  account cyclic competition with more complex underlying
		  mechanisms. In this paper we reveal an entirely new kind of
		  cyclic competition—‘conditional’ cyclic competition,
		  with a different underlying mechanism to ‘classic’
		  cyclic competition—and we show that biodiversity in
		  communities with cyclic competition in fact depends heavily
		  on the ratios between the species mobilities. Furthermore,
		  we show that this dependence can be completely different
		  for conditional and classic cyclic competition. We also
		  present a wide range of spatiotemporal patterns which are
		  formed in the system, including spiral and target waves,
		  spiralling patches, and irregular chaotic patches. We show
		  that the previously unknown case of conditional cyclic
		  competition is host to a scenario of patchy co-invasion,
		  where the spread of the population front takes place via
		  the formation, splitting and propagation of patches of high
		  species density. This is also an example of invasional
		  meltdown because one competitor facilitates the invasion of
		  the other, but unlike well-known cases of invasional
		  meltdown the co-invaders in this system are not mutualists
		  but antagonistic competitors, and the overall result
		  mitigates, rather than amplifies, the damage done to the
		  native ecosystem.},

		  systems. In the three reactions that comprise this process,
		  the intermediate enzyme-substrate complex is usually much
		  more likely to decay into its original constituents than to

		  reaction set mathematically "stiff." We show here how the
		  simulation of this stiff reaction set can be dramatically
		  speeded up relative to the standard stochastic simulation
		  algorithm (SSA) by using a recently introduced procedure
		  called the slow-scale SSA. The speedup occurs because the
		  slow-scale SSA explicitly simulates only the relatively
		  rare conversion reactions, skipping over occurrences of the
		  other two less interesting but much more frequent
		  reactions. We describe, explain, and illustrate this
		  simulation procedure for the isolated enzyme-substrate
		  reaction set, and then we show how the procedure extends to
		  the more typical case in which the enzyme-substrate
		  reactions occur together with other reactions and species.
		  Finally, we explain the connection between this slow-scale

		  (1913)] formula, which has long been used in deterministic
		  chemical kinetics to describe the enzyme-substrate

  abstract	= {In marine systems, seagrass meadows, which serve as
		  essential nursery and adult habitat for numerous species,
		  experience fragmentation through both human activity and
		  environmental processes. Results from studies involving
		  seagrass patch size and edge effects on associated fauna
		  have shown that patchy seagrass habitats can be either
		  beneficial or detrimental. One reason for the variable
		  results might be the existence of ecological trade-offs for
		  species that associate with seagrass habitats. Bay
		  scallops, Argopecten irradians, are useful model organisms
		  for studying the response of a semi-mobile bivalve to
		  changes in seagrass seascapes—they exhibit a strong
		  habitat association and seagrass offers a predation refuge
		  at a cost of reduced growth. This study investigated the
		  potential ecological survival–growth trade-off for bay
		  scallops living within a seagrass seascape. Scallop growth
		  was consistently fastest in bare sand and slowest at patch
		  centers, and survival showed the opposite trend. Scallops
		  in patch edges displayed intermediate growth and survival.
		  Using models for minimizing mortality (μ) to foraging (f)
		  ratios, the data suggests seagrass edge habitat offered
		  similar value to patch centers. Further, investigations of
		  core-area index suggest that small, complex patches might
		  offer scallops a balance between predation risk and
		  maximized growth. Taken in sum, these results suggest that
		  edge habitats may benefit organisms like bay scallops by
		  maximizing risk versus reward and maximizing edge
		  habitat.},

  year		= {2013},
  month		= jan,
  abstract	= {Reaction-diffusion models have been widely used to
		  describe the dynamics of dispersing populations. However,
		  many organisms disperse in ways that depend on
		  environmental conditions or the densities of other
		  populations. Those can include advection along
		  environmental gradients and nonlinear diffusion, among
		  other possibilities. In this paper I will give a survey of
		  some models involving conditional dispersal and discuss its
		  effects and evolution. The presence of conditional
		  dispersal can strongly influence the equilibria of
		  population models, for example by causing the population to
		  concentrate at local maxima of resource density. The
		  analysis of the evolutionary aspects of dispersal is
		  typically based on a study of models for two competing
		  populations that are ecologically identical except for
		  their dispersal strategies. The models consist of
		  Lotka-Volterra competition systems with some spatially
		  varying coefficients and with diffusion, nonlinear
		  diffusion, and/or advection terms that reflect the
		  dispersal strategies of the competing populations. The
		  evolutionary stability of dispersal strategies can be
		  determined by analyzing the stability of single-species
		  equilibria in such models. In the case of simple diffusion
		  in spatially varying environments it has been known for
		  some time that the slower diffuser will exclude the faster
		  diffuser, but conditional dispersal can change that. In
		  some cases a population whose dispersal strategy involves
		  advection along environmental gradients has the advantage
		  or can coexist with a population that simply diffuses. As
		  is often the case in reaction-diffusion theory, many of the
		  results depend on the analysis of eigenvalue problems for
		  linearized models.},

		  potentially important but rarely considered is community
		  assembly. I assembled model communities using species pools
		  of differing size to examine how the history of community
		  assembly may affect multi-scale diversity patterns. The
		  model contained three scales at which diversity could be
		  measured: local community, metacommunity, and species pool.
		  Local species saturation occurred, as expected from the
		  competition and predation built in the model. However,
		  local communities did not become resistant to invasions
		  except when the species pool was very small. Depending on
		  dispersal rate and trophic level, the larger the species
		  pool, the harder it was to predict which species invades
		  which local community at a given time. Consequently,
		  local-community dissimilarity maintained by assembly
		  history increased linearly with pool size, even though
		  local diversity was decoupled from pool size. These results
		  have two implications for multi-scale diversity patterns.
		  First, assembly history may provide an explanation for
		  scale-dependent relationships between local and regional
		  diversity: assembly causes the relationship to be
		  curvilinear at one scale (local community), while linear at
		  another (metacommunity). Second, assembly history
		  influences how γ-diversity is partitioned into α- and
		  β-diversity: assembly causes the relative contribution of
		  β to increase with pool size. Overall, this study suggests
		  that community assembly history interacts with species pool
		  size to regulate multi-scale patterns of species
		  diversity.},

		  identify three qualitative responses to edges: no edge
		  effect (the null model), reflecting edges and absorbing
		  edges. Interestingly, no edge effect meant that abundance
		  was lower at edges than in the center of patches, and
		  reflecting edges have similar abundance at edges and
		  centers. We then characterized several insect species’
		  response within maize plots to patch edges and patch size,
		  using a simple, quick, qualitative experiment. Coleomegilla
		  maculata and Trichogramma spp. were the only organisms that
		  responded to patch size and edges as patch theory and the
		  null edge model would predict. Ostrinia nubilalis larvae
		  and possibly Rhopalosiphum maidis and eggs of Chrysopa spp.
		  responded to patch size and edges as predicted by an
		  attracting edge model. Estimation of predation rates
		  suggested that the spatial distribution of these species
		  might be determined by predators. Edge effects or the lack
		  thereof relative to patch size may be rapidly determined
		  for arthropod species, which could lead to understanding
		  the mechanism(s) underlying these effects. This information
		  may be useful in reaction diffusion models through a
		  scaling-up approach to predict population structure of

  abstract	= {Organisms inhabiting river systems contend with downstream
		  biased flow in a complex tree-like network. Differential
		  equation models are often used to study population
		  persistence, thus suggesting resolutions of the ‘drift
		  paradox’, by considering the dependence of persistence on
		  such variables as advection rate, dispersal
		  characteristics, and domain size. Most previous models that
		  explicitly considered network geometry artificially
		  discretized river habitat into distinct patches. With the
		  recent exception of Ramirez (J Math Biol 65:919–942,
		  2012), partial differential equation models have largely
		  ignored the global geometry of river systems and the
		  effects of tributary junctions by using intervals to
		  describe the spatial domain. Taking advantage of recent
		  developments in the analysis of eigenvalue problems on
		  quantum graphs, we use a reaction–diffusion–advection
		  equation on a metric tree graph to analyze persistence of a
		  single population in terms of dispersal parameters and
		  network geometry. The metric graph represents a continuous
		  network where edges represent actual domain rather than
		  connections among patches. Here, network geometry usually
		  has a significant impact on persistence, and occasionally
		  leads to dramatically altered predictions. This work ranges
		  over such themes as model definition, reduction to a
		  diffusion equation with the associated model features,
		  numerical and analytical studies in radially symmetric
		  geometries, and theoretical results for general domains.
		  Notable in the model assumptions is that the zero-flux
		  interior junction conditions are not restricted to
		  conservation of hydrological discharge.},

		  use an impulsive reaction--diffusion equation with

		  stoneflies. We analyze this model from a variety of
		  perspectives so as to understand the effect of upstream

		  we use the perspective of weak versus local persistence,
		  and connect the concept of local persistence to positive up
		  and downstream spreading speeds. These spreading speeds, in
		  turn are connected to minimum travelling wave speeds for
		  the linearized operator in upstream and downstream
		  directions. We show that the conditions for weak and local
		  persistence differ, and describe how weak persistence can
		  give rise to a population whose numbers are growing but is
		  being washed out because it cannot maintain a toe hold at
		  any given location. On finite domains, we employ the
		  concept of a critical domain size and dispersal success
		  approximation to determine the ultimate fate of the
		  populations. A simple, explicit formula for a special case
		  allows us to quantify exactly the difference between weak
