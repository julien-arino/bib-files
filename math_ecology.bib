  abstract	= {One of the most crucial tasks faced by biologists today is
		  revealing the mechanisms which account for biodiversity,
		  yet we are still far from a full understanding of these
		  mechanisms, and in particular the role of spatially
		  heterogeneous population distributions. Recently, the
		  spatially heterogeneous coexistence seen in cyclic
		  competition modelsâ€”in which species compete as in the
		  game rock-paper-scissorsâ€”has brought them to the fore as
		  a paradigm for biodiversity. Research into cyclic
		  competition has so far been focused almost exclusively on
		  stochastic lattice models with discrete space, which ignore
		  several key dynamical aspects. In particular, such models
		  usually assume that species disperse at the same speed.
		  This paper aims to extend our understanding of cyclic
		  competition by applying a reactionâ€“diffusion
		  Lotkaâ€“Volterra scheme to the problem, which allows us to
		  vary the mobility of each species, and lets us take into
		  account cyclic competition with more complex underlying
		  mechanisms. In this paper we reveal an entirely new kind of
		  cyclic competitionâ€”â€˜conditionalâ€™ cyclic competition,
		  with a different underlying mechanism to â€˜classicâ€™
		  cyclic competitionâ€”and we show that biodiversity in
		  communities with cyclic competition in fact depends heavily
		  on the ratios between the species mobilities. Furthermore,
		  we show that this dependence can be completely different
		  for conditional and classic cyclic competition. We also
		  present a wide range of spatiotemporal patterns which are
		  formed in the system, including spiral and target waves,
		  spiralling patches, and irregular chaotic patches. We show
		  that the previously unknown case of conditional cyclic
		  competition is host to a scenario of patchy co-invasion,
		  where the spread of the population front takes place via
		  the formation, splitting and propagation of patches of high
		  species density. This is also an example of invasional
		  meltdown because one competitor facilitates the invasion of
		  the other, but unlike well-known cases of invasional
		  meltdown the co-invaders in this system are not mutualists
		  but antagonistic competitors, and the overall result
		  mitigates, rather than amplifies, the damage done to the
		  native ecosystem.},

		  seagrass patch size and edge effects on associated fauna
		  have shown that patchy seagrass habitats can be either

		  results might be the existence of ecological trade-offs for
		  species that associate with seagrass habitats. Bay
		  scallops, Argopecten irradians, are useful model organisms
		  for studying the response of a semi-mobile bivalve to
		  changes in seagrass seascapesâ€”they exhibit a strong
		  habitat association and seagrass offers a predation refuge
		  at a cost of reduced growth. This study investigated the
		  potential ecological survivalâ€“growth trade-off for bay
		  scallops living within a seagrass seascape. Scallop growth
		  was consistently fastest in bare sand and slowest at patch
		  centers, and survival showed the opposite trend. Scallops
		  in patch edges displayed intermediate growth and survival.
		  Using models for minimizing mortality (Î¼) to foraging (f)
		  ratios, the data suggests seagrass edge habitat offered
		  similar value to patch centers. Further, investigations of
		  core-area index suggest that small, complex patches might
		  offer scallops a balance between predation risk and

		  edge habitats may benefit organisms like bay scallops by
		  maximizing risk versus reward and maximizing edge

  year		= {2013},
  month		= jan,
  abstract	= {Reaction-diffusion models have been widely used to
		  describe the dynamics of dispersing populations. However,
		  many organisms disperse in ways that depend on
		  environmental conditions or the densities of other
		  populations. Those can include advection along
		  environmental gradients and nonlinear diffusion, among
		  other possibilities. In this paper I will give a survey of
		  some models involving conditional dispersal and discuss its
		  effects and evolution. The presence of conditional
		  dispersal can strongly influence the equilibria of
		  population models, for example by causing the population to
		  concentrate at local maxima of resource density. The
		  analysis of the evolutionary aspects of dispersal is
		  typically based on a study of models for two competing
		  populations that are ecologically identical except for
		  their dispersal strategies. The models consist of
		  Lotka-Volterra competition systems with some spatially
		  varying coefficients and with diffusion, nonlinear
		  diffusion, and/or advection terms that reflect the
		  dispersal strategies of the competing populations. The
		  evolutionary stability of dispersal strategies can be
		  determined by analyzing the stability of single-species
		  equilibria in such models. In the case of simple diffusion
		  in spatially varying environments it has been known for
		  some time that the slower diffuser will exclude the faster
		  diffuser, but conditional dispersal can change that. In
		  some cases a population whose dispersal strategy involves
		  advection along environmental gradients has the advantage
		  or can coexist with a population that simply diffuses. As
		  is often the case in reaction-diffusion theory, many of the
		  results depend on the analysis of eigenvalue problems for
		  linearized models.},

		  of differing size to examine how the history of community
		  assembly may affect multi-scale diversity patterns. The
		  model contained three scales at which diversity could be
		  measured: local community, metacommunity, and species pool.
		  Local species saturation occurred, as expected from the
		  competition and predation built in the model. However,
		  local communities did not become resistant to invasions
		  except when the species pool was very small. Depending on
		  dispersal rate and trophic level, the larger the species
		  pool, the harder it was to predict which species invades
		  which local community at a given time. Consequently,
		  local-community dissimilarity maintained by assembly
		  history increased linearly with pool size, even though
		  local diversity was decoupled from pool size. These results
		  have two implications for multi-scale diversity patterns.
		  First, assembly history may provide an explanation for
		  scale-dependent relationships between local and regional
		  diversity: assembly causes the relationship to be
		  curvilinear at one scale (local community), while linear at
		  another (metacommunity). Second, assembly history
		  influences how Î³-diversity is partitioned into Î±- and
		  Î²-diversity: assembly causes the relative contribution of
		  Î² to increase with pool size. Overall, this study suggests

  abstract	= {We discuss the effects of dispersal (either random or
		  biased) and spatial heterogeneity on population dynamics
		  via reactionâ€“advectionâ€“diffusion models. We address the
		  question of determining optimal spatial arrangement of
		  resources and study how advection along resource gradients
		  affects the extinction of species. The effects of dispersal
		  and spatial heterogeneity on the total population size of
		  single species are carefully investigated, along with some
		  other properties of species. These properties have
		  important applications to invasions of rare species. Some
		  interesting connection between the evolution of
		  unconditional dispersal and diffusion-driven extinction is
		  revealed. We also investigate the outcome of competition
		  for two similar species, and show how invasion and
		  coexistence are affected by resource utilization,
		  inter-specific competition, and dynamics of habitat edges.
		  In particular, interesting effects of intermediate values
		  of dispersal rates are found. The evolution of conditional
		  dispersal is also addressed, and we illustrate that the
		  geometry of a habitat can play an important role in the
		  evolution of conditional dispersal and that strong directed
		  movement of species can induce the coexistence of competing
		  species. If both species disperse by random diffusion and
		  advection along environmental gradients and one species has
		  much stronger biased movement than the other one, then at
		  least two scenarios can occur: either both species can
		  coexist or the â€œsmarterâ€? species is always the loser.
		  These results seem to suggest that selection is against
		  large advection along resource gradient and that an
		  intermediate biased movement rate may evolve. Numerous open
		  problems will be discussed.},

		  equation models are often used to study population
		  persistence, thus suggesting resolutions of the â€˜drift
		  paradoxâ€™, by considering the dependence of persistence on
		  such variables as advection rate, dispersal
		  characteristics, and domain size. Most previous models that
		  explicitly considered network geometry artificially
		  discretized river habitat into distinct patches. With the
		  recent exception of Ramirez (J Math Biol 65:919â€“942,
		  2012), partial differential equation models have largely
		  ignored the global geometry of river systems and the
		  effects of tributary junctions by using intervals to

		  equation on a metric tree graph to analyze persistence of a

		  connections among patches. Here, network geometry usually
		  has a significant impact on persistence, and occasionally
		  leads to dramatically altered predictions. This work ranges
		  over such themes as model definition, reduction to a
		  diffusion equation with the associated model features,
		  numerical and analytical studies in radially symmetric
