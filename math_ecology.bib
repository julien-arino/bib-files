  abstract	= {One of the most crucial tasks faced by biologists today is
		  revealing the mechanisms which account for biodiversity,
		  yet we are still far from a full understanding of these
		  mechanisms, and in particular the role of spatially
		  heterogeneous population distributions. Recently, the
		  spatially heterogeneous coexistence seen in cyclic
		  competition models—in which species compete as in the
		  game rock-paper-scissors—has brought them to the fore as
		  a paradigm for biodiversity. Research into cyclic
		  competition has so far been focused almost exclusively on
		  stochastic lattice models with discrete space, which ignore
		  several key dynamical aspects. In particular, such models
		  usually assume that species disperse at the same speed.
		  This paper aims to extend our understanding of cyclic
		  competition by applying a reaction–diffusion
		  Lotka–Volterra scheme to the problem, which allows us to
		  vary the mobility of each species, and lets us take into
		  account cyclic competition with more complex underlying
		  mechanisms. In this paper we reveal an entirely new kind of
		  cyclic competition—‘conditional’ cyclic competition,
		  with a different underlying mechanism to ‘classic’
		  cyclic competition—and we show that biodiversity in
		  communities with cyclic competition in fact depends heavily
		  on the ratios between the species mobilities. Furthermore,
		  we show that this dependence can be completely different
		  for conditional and classic cyclic competition. We also
		  present a wide range of spatiotemporal patterns which are
		  formed in the system, including spiral and target waves,
		  spiralling patches, and irregular chaotic patches. We show
		  that the previously unknown case of conditional cyclic
		  competition is host to a scenario of patchy co-invasion,
		  where the spread of the population front takes place via
		  the formation, splitting and propagation of patches of high
		  species density. This is also an example of invasional
		  meltdown because one competitor facilitates the invasion of
		  the other, but unlike well-known cases of invasional
		  meltdown the co-invaders in this system are not mutualists
		  but antagonistic competitors, and the overall result
		  mitigates, rather than amplifies, the damage done to the
		  native ecosystem.},

		  have shown that patchy seagrass habitats can be either

		  results might be the existence of ecological trade-offs for
		  species that associate with seagrass habitats. Bay
		  scallops, Argopecten irradians, are useful model organisms
		  for studying the response of a semi-mobile bivalve to

		  at a cost of reduced growth. This study investigated the
		  potential ecological survival–growth trade-off for bay
		  scallops living within a seagrass seascape. Scallop growth
		  was consistently fastest in bare sand and slowest at patch
		  centers, and survival showed the opposite trend. Scallops
		  in patch edges displayed intermediate growth and survival.
		  Using models for minimizing mortality (μ) to foraging (f)
		  ratios, the data suggests seagrass edge habitat offered
		  similar value to patch centers. Further, investigations of
		  core-area index suggest that small, complex patches might
		  offer scallops a balance between predation risk and

		  edge habitats may benefit organisms like bay scallops by
		  maximizing risk versus reward and maximizing edge

  year		= {2013},
  month		= jan,
  abstract	= {Reaction-diffusion models have been widely used to
		  describe the dynamics of dispersing populations. However,
		  many organisms disperse in ways that depend on
		  environmental conditions or the densities of other
		  populations. Those can include advection along
		  environmental gradients and nonlinear diffusion, among
		  other possibilities. In this paper I will give a survey of
		  some models involving conditional dispersal and discuss its
		  effects and evolution. The presence of conditional
		  dispersal can strongly influence the equilibria of
		  population models, for example by causing the population to
		  concentrate at local maxima of resource density. The
		  analysis of the evolutionary aspects of dispersal is
		  typically based on a study of models for two competing
		  populations that are ecologically identical except for
		  their dispersal strategies. The models consist of
		  Lotka-Volterra competition systems with some spatially
		  varying coefficients and with diffusion, nonlinear
		  diffusion, and/or advection terms that reflect the
		  dispersal strategies of the competing populations. The
		  evolutionary stability of dispersal strategies can be
		  determined by analyzing the stability of single-species
		  equilibria in such models. In the case of simple diffusion
		  in spatially varying environments it has been known for
		  some time that the slower diffuser will exclude the faster
		  diffuser, but conditional dispersal can change that. In
		  some cases a population whose dispersal strategy involves
		  advection along environmental gradients has the advantage
		  or can coexist with a population that simply diffuses. As
		  is often the case in reaction-diffusion theory, many of the
		  results depend on the analysis of eigenvalue problems for
		  linearized models.},

		  of differing size to examine how the history of community
		  assembly may affect multi-scale diversity patterns. The
		  model contained three scales at which diversity could be
		  measured: local community, metacommunity, and species pool.
		  Local species saturation occurred, as expected from the
		  competition and predation built in the model. However,
		  local communities did not become resistant to invasions
		  except when the species pool was very small. Depending on
		  dispersal rate and trophic level, the larger the species

		  history increased linearly with pool size, even though
		  local diversity was decoupled from pool size. These results
		  have two implications for multi-scale diversity patterns.
		  First, assembly history may provide an explanation for
		  scale-dependent relationships between local and regional
		  diversity: assembly causes the relationship to be
		  curvilinear at one scale (local community), while linear at
		  another (metacommunity). Second, assembly history
		  influences how γ-diversity is partitioned into α- and
		  β-diversity: assembly causes the relative contribution of

  abstract	= {We discuss the effects of dispersal (either random or
		  biased) and spatial heterogeneity on population dynamics
		  via reaction–advection–diffusion models. We address the
		  question of determining optimal spatial arrangement of
		  resources and study how advection along resource gradients
		  affects the extinction of species. The effects of dispersal
		  and spatial heterogeneity on the total population size of
		  single species are carefully investigated, along with some
		  other properties of species. These properties have
		  important applications to invasions of rare species. Some
		  interesting connection between the evolution of
		  unconditional dispersal and diffusion-driven extinction is
		  revealed. We also investigate the outcome of competition
		  for two similar species, and show how invasion and
		  coexistence are affected by resource utilization,
		  inter-specific competition, and dynamics of habitat edges.
		  In particular, interesting effects of intermediate values
		  of dispersal rates are found. The evolution of conditional
		  dispersal is also addressed, and we illustrate that the
		  geometry of a habitat can play an important role in the
		  evolution of conditional dispersal and that strong directed
		  movement of species can induce the coexistence of competing
		  species. If both species disperse by random diffusion and
		  advection along environmental gradients and one species has
		  much stronger biased movement than the other one, then at
		  least two scenarios can occur: either both species can
		  coexist or the “smarter�? species is always the loser.
		  These results seem to suggest that selection is against
		  large advection along resource gradient and that an
		  intermediate biased movement rate may evolve. Numerous open
		  problems will be discussed.},

		  has been related to spatiotemporal changes in the habitat

		  Consequently, in this paper, we examined the peer-reviewed,

		  understand the consequences of variability in connectivity
		  and to highlight knowledge gaps on this topic. First, we
		  describe how connectivity per se can vary along a temporal

The resulting lack of connectivity of spatial subpopulations is often cited as a cause for observed population decline. We formulate a matrix model for a spatially distributed fish population in a watershed, and we investigate how location and other characteristics of a single movement barrier impact the asymptotic growth rate of the population. We find that while population growth rate often decreases with the introduction of a movement obstacle, it may also increase due to a ‘retention effect’. Furthermore, obstacle mortality greatly affects population growth rate. In practice, different connectivity indices are used to predict population effects of migration barriers, but the relation of these indices to population growth rates in demographic models is often unclear. When comparing our results with the dentritic connectivity index, we see that the index captures neither the retention effect nor the influences of obstacle mortality. We argue that structural indices cannot entirely replace more detailed demographic models to understand questions of persistence and extinction. We advocate the development of novel functional indices and characteristics.},

  year     = {2016},
  abstract = {We investigate the impact of changing nonuniform spatial and temporal precipitation patterns on the evolution of river networks. To achieve this, we develop a two‐dimensional optimal channel network (OCN) model with a controllable rainfall distribution to simulate the evolution of river networks, governed by the principle of minimum energy expenditure, inside a prescribed boundary. We show that under nonuniform precipitation conditions, river networks reorganize significantly toward new patterns with different geomorphic and hydrologic signatures. This reorganization is mainly observed in the form of migration of channels of different orders, widening or elongation of basins as well as formation and extinction of channels and basins. In particular, when the precipitation gradient is locally increased, the higher‐order channels, including the mainstream river, migrate toward regions with higher precipitation intensity. Through pertinent examples, the reorganization of the drainage network is quantified via stream parameters such as Horton‐Strahler and Tokunaga measures, order‐based channel total length and river long profiles obtained via simulation of three‐dimensional basin topography, while the hydrologic response of the evolved network is investigated using metrics such as hydrograph and power spectral density of simulated streamflows at the outlet of the network. In addition, using OCNs, we investigate the effect of orographic precipitation patterns on multicatchment landscapes composed of several interacting basins. Our results show that network‐inspired methods can be utilized as insightful and versatile models for directly exploring the effects of climate change on the evolution of river drainage systems.},

  abstract  = {Terrestrial carbon dynamics influence the contribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to river networks in addition to hydrology. In this study, we use a biogeochemical process model to simulate the lateral transfer of DOC from land to the Arctic Ocean via riverine transport. We estimate that, over the 20th century, the pan-Arctic watershed has contributed, on average, 32 Tg C/yr of DOC to river networks emptying into the Arctic Ocean with most of the DOC coming from the extensive area of boreal deciduous needle-leaved forests and forested wetlands in Eurasian watersheds. We also estimate that the rate of terrestrial DOC loading has been increasing by 0.037 Tg C/yr2 over the 20th century primarily as a result of climate-induced increases in water yield. These increases have been offset by decreases in terrestrial DOC loading caused by wildfires. Other environmental factors (CO2 fertilization, ozone pollution, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, timber harvest, agriculture) are estimated to have relatively small effects on terrestrial DOC loading to Arctic rivers. The effects of the various environmental factors on terrestrial carbon dynamics have both offset and enhanced concurrent effects on hydrology to influence terrestrial DOC loading and may be changing the relative importance of terrestrial carbon dynamics on this carbon flux. Improvements in simulating terrestrial DOC loading to pan-Arctic rivers in the future will require better information on the production and consumption of DOC within the soil profile, the transfer of DOC from land to headwater streams, the spatial distribution of precipitation and its temporal trends, carbon dynamics of larch-dominated ecosystems in eastern Siberia, and the role of industrial organic effluents on carbon budgets of rivers in western Russia.},

  year     = {2022},
  abstract = {The Mackenzie Delta is an extensive river-mouth depocentre, the second largest delta on the Arctic Ocean, and lies in the zone of continuous permafrost. We report the first measurements of natural consolidation subsidence in a high-latitude delta with ice-bonded sediments. Several years of episodic GPS records on a network of 15 stable monuments throughout the central and outer delta reveal downward motion between 1.5 ± 0.7 and 5.3 ± 1.1 mm/yr relative to a nearby monument on bedrock. Additional shallow subsidence results from loss of near-surface excess ice with deeper seasonal thaw in a warming climate. Isostatic adjustment is a third component of subsidence, captured in the NAD83v70VG crustal velocity model. Sedimentation rates over much of the outer delta are less than the rate of subsidence combined with rising sea level. Scenarios for future inundation are evaluated using interpolated IPCC AR5 projections, NAD83v70VG, and a LiDAR DEM with realistic consolidation, thaw subsidence, and sedimentation rates, on time scales of 40 and 90 years. These reveal increases in area flooded at mean water level from 33% in 2010 to 65% or as much as 85% in 2100, depending on the emissions scenario, driving delta-front retreat and removing a large proportion of avian nesting habitat. The three components of subsidence together increase the relative sea-level rise by a factor of two to eight, depending on the scenario. Consolidation subsidence may also contribute to rising low-flow water levels in the central delta, increasing river-lake connectivity, with negative impacts on aquatic biodiversity and productivity.},

In the open water season of May–October, Mackenzie River provides a critical corridor for Canada's Arctic transportation network. With nine sets of physical parameterizations of WRF selected, we simulated the climate of MRB over representative dry, normal, and wet years to identify the best setting prior to performing the 27‐year simulation for 1979–2005. The major physical parameterizations considered were shortwave (Dudhia, CAM, and RRTMG) and longwave radiation scheme (RRTM, CAM, and RRTMG), microphysics scheme (WRF Double‐Moment 6‐class, WRF Single‐Moment 5‐class, Stony Brook University, and Morrison double‐moment), and cumulus parameterization (Kain–Fritsch, Betts–Miller–Janjic, Tiedtke, and New Simplified Arakawa–Schubert). The simulation for MRB by each set of parameterizations of WRF is assessed using root‐mean‐square error (RMSE), absolute error percentage, and bias maps. After a detailed fine tuning process, and from verifying the 1979–2005 long‐term simulations of WRF, WRF generally simulated realistic air temperature and precipitable water over MRB, but precipitation is over‐simulated, especially at Canadian Rockies.},

  year     = {2020},
  abstract = {Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) model has been widely used to simulate fractal aggregation processes. This DLA model and its improved model growth diffusion-limited aggregation (GDLA) can reasonably plan and manage rivers within the basin scale. In this paper, the growth and evolution of the river network at the basin scale were simulated using the Northwest China Basin as the study area. To achieve this research goal, this paper used gas injection system image processing technology and data analysis methods for overall processing and distributed processing of river basin remote sensing data. A new growth method, unit-gradient growth, was added to the standard DLA model, and a combination of the extracted Daxia River Basin geomorphological features and DEM data was used to optimize the Brownian motion of the model particle growth method. A computational model was proposed: GDLA model to predict the river network growth in the study area. The fractal dimension of the river network in the study area was extracted and corrected by the box-counting method. Finally, the predicted river network was compared with the extracted actual river network. The included angle cosine method was used for modeling evaluation and analysis. The results showed that the fractal dimension of the Daxia River Basin and sub-basin water systems was less than 1.6, indicating that the basin geomorphology was in its infancy. The structural similarity degrees were greater than 0.99, indicating that the GDLA model had a better simulation on fractal river networks, which can successfully reproduce and predict different morphological two-dimensional river networks. Studies showed that using GDLA to model fractal river networks can better predict the river network growth and evolution, ultimately promoting sustainable development of river basin water management.},

  abstract = {Climate change presents problems for risk assessment procedures due to the difficulty of assigning a measure of probability to any future scenario. Grey systems theory provides an alternative means of quantifying uncertainty based on interval numbers. Within a mathematical programming model, grey systems theory provides a means for working with uncertainties that are not amenable to stochastic or fuzzy quantification. An example of forestry and agricultural expansion in the Mackenzie River Basin is used to illustrate grey mathematical programming in a hop, skip and jump formulation. In this example, climatic constraints are implicitly contained in other parameters which did not incorporate the different components of uncertainty associated with meteorological observations. These components can be combined into a numerical interval that can be used in determining a grey number. However, most of these uncertainties are negligible in climatic data sets due to the number of observations. Nevertheless, these uncertainties point to some of the problems in assessing the risks of climate change, and a grey mathematical programming algorithm is useful for assessing the sensitivity of a decision to climatically sensitive parameters.},

This phenomena has been particularly apparent on satellite imagery. The work reported here attempts (1) to quantify and assess the influence of springtime river discharge on the removal of nearshore ice and (2) to demonstrate the utility of satellite imagery as a source of data to “drive” a model assessing the influence of springtime river discharge on the removal of nearshore ice. Central to this work is a sequence of advanced very high resolution radiometer images of the Mackenzie Delta region, Northwest Territories, Canada. These images constitute a database establishing the temporal sequence of observable breakup events from which a thermodynamic model for the ice decay can be parameterized. The emphases of this model are the influence of the riverine sensible heat on the melting of sea ice and the ability of satellite imagery to monitor this process. For simplicity, climatological values rather than meteorological values for atmospheric and solar influences have been used. The results suggest that the river discharge supplies a significant amount of sensible heat to the base of the nearshore ice, accounting for nearly half of the energy required to melt the ice cover. As a result, the coastal ice is removed 7–14 days in advance of areas without significant river discharge.},

The HRR modelling framework performs lateral surface and subsurface run‐off routing from hillslopes and channel/floodplain routing. The HRR model was modified here to include a variable subsurface active layer thickness (ALT; permafrost) to enable subsurface water to resurface, a distributed surface storage component to store and attenuate the rapid generation of snowmelt water, compound hillslopes to account for the low relief near rivers and floodplains, and reservoir routing to complete the total surface and subsurface water storage accounting. To illustrate the new HRR model components, a case study is presented for the MRB. The basin is discretized into 5077 sub‐basins based on a drainage network derived from the global digital elevation model (DEM) developed from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor on board NASA's Terra satellite and river widths extracted from LandSat images. The median hillslope land area is 68.5 km2 with a flow length of 2.8 km. Gridded CLM surface and subsurface run‐offs are remapped to the HRR model's irregular sub‐basins. The role of each new model component is quantified in terms of peak annual streamflow (magnitude and timing) at select locations and basin‐wide total water storage anomalies. The role of distributed surface storage is shown to attenuate the relatively rapid generation of snowmelt water, impact the annual peak hydrograph (reduced peaks by >30% and detailed peak by >20 days), and account for 20% of the monthly total water storage anomalies averaged over the year and ranging from 14 to 25% (−10 to 30 mm) throughout the year. Although additional research is needed to dynamically link spatially distributed ALT to HRR, the role of ALT is shown to be important. A basin‐wide, uniform 1 m ALT impacts the annual peak hydrograph (reduced peaks by 9% and detailed peak by 8 days) and trends in total water storage anomalies.

  abstract = {A temporal upscaling study was conducted to estimate net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide and net methane exchange (NME) for a Low-Center Polygon (LCP) ecosystem in the Mackenzie River Delta, for each of eleven growing seasons (2009 to 2019). We used regression models to create a time series of flux drivers from in-situ weather observations (2009-2019) combined with ERA5 reanalysis and satellite data. We then used neural network that were trained and validated on a single growing season (2017) of eddy covariance data to model NEE and NME over each growing season. The study indicates growing season NEE was negative (net uptake) and NME was positive (net emission) in this LCP ecosystem. Cumulative carbon (C) uptake was estimated to be -46.7 g C m-2 [CI95% ± 45.3] per growing season, with methane emissions offsetting an average 5.6% of carbon dioxide uptake (in g C m-2) per growing season. High air temperatures (> 15 °C) reduced daily CO2 uptake and cumulative NEE was positively correlated with mean air growing season temperatures. Cumulative NME was positively correlated with the length of the growing season. Our analysis suggests warmer climate conditions may reduce carbon uptake in this LCP ecosystem.},

  abstract = {This study provides an improved statistical modelling framework for understanding historical variability and trends in water constituent fluxes in subarctic western Canada. We evaluated total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes for the Hay, Liard and Peel tributaries of the Mackenzie River. The TP and DOC concentrations primarily exhibit chemodynamic relationships with discharge, with the exception of the chemostatic relationship between DOC and discharge for the Hay River. With this understanding, we explored a number of enhancements in the load estimation model that included the use of (i) linear regression and logarithmic models, (ii) air-temperature as an alternate input variable and (iii) quantile mapping for bias-correction. Further, we evaluated uncertainties in the simulation of fluxes and trends by using a bootstrapping method. The modelled TP and DOC fluxes show considerable seasonal and interannual variability that generally follow the runoff dynamics. The annual and seasonal trends are mostly small and insignificant, with the largest significant increases occurring in the winter months. These trends are amplified compared with discharge, suggesting the possibility of pronounced changes with large changes in discharge. Additionally, the results provide evidence that directly using limited water constituent samples for trend analysis can be problematic.},

This paper describes the procedures used to generate two bias-corrected data products WFDEI-GEM-CaPA and CanRCM4 for hydrological modelling and climate change impact analysis in Mackenzie River basin. The uniqueness of WFDEI-GEM-CaPA data is from combining the WFDEI and GEM-CaPA data sets with multivariate bias correction and model fitting methods. WFDEI data set has a longer record period (1979-2016) and is biased from the observations in Mackenzie River basin. The GEM-CaPA data set has a shorter record period (2005-2016) and matches well with the observations in Mackenzie River basin. As a result of the combining, the record length of the combined WFDEI-GEM-CaPA data is the same with that of WFDEI and the biases in WFDEI data were corrected. The bias-corrected CanRCM4 data product was obtained from the modified CanRCM4 output (1950-2100) after using the WFDEI-GEM-CaPA data product to correct the 15-member CanRCM4 initial condition ensemble in the historical period (1979-2008). The data products are of significance in developing distributed hydrological models and improving the assessment of the climate change impacts over the Mackenzie River basin. Overall, the paper was written and organized very well. It introduces the data sources and explains how these data sources were selected and used. It clearly presents the outline of the multi stages of data processing and bias corrections. It uses station observations to validate the bias corrections and the provided results prove the added values of the two data products as a constant set of historical and climate projection data for large-scale modeling and future climate scenario analysis. you.

The data descriptio n paper entitled “High -Resolution Meteorological Forcing Data for Hydrological Modelling and Climate Change Impact Analysis in Mackenzie River Basin” describes a new gridded climate reanalysis data set (WFDEI-GEM-CaPA) and its application to correct biases in CanRCM4 data set over the Mackenzie River Basin. The data set consist of seven hydro-climatic variables that are required to run a distributed and process based hydrologic model over the basin. The original data sets used to generate the new gridded data are described briefly and the methodology followed in blending the original data as well as validating the resulting new data set is well described. The resulting bias corrected CanRCM4 data is also shown to preserve the climate projection signals while removing the biases on monthly basis. In general, the manuscript describes very well the steps in preparing the new data sets as well as the added value gained from these new data sets.

  title    = {Habitat connectivity and dispersal ability drive the assembly mechanisms of macroinvertebrate communities in river networks},
  year     = {2017},
  abstract = {Metacommunity studies commonly use spatial distances or, more recently, landscape resistance measures between study sites as a surrogate for connectivity. However, local communities are connected to many other sources of colonisation than the sites included in a study, and the availability and distance to potential colonisation sources may be better surrogates for dispersal than distances to other sampling sites.
Here we test the effect of habitat connectivity on the assembly of stream-riffle macroinvertebrates with different dispersal abilities, after controlling for habitat heterogeneity and among-site distances (62 km on average). We used a null model approach to compare observed community dissimilarity to random expectation. Significant deviations from randomness were expected due to the hierarchical structure of river networks with their increasing flux of organisms from headwaters to mainstem reaches.
We found a gradual shift in dispersal-based processes driving assembly mechanisms, from dispersal limitation in the isolated headwater streams to randomness in connected headwater and isolated mid-order streams, and to mass effects in the most connected mid-order streams.
Weak flyers were constrained by dispersal limitation in the most isolated sites, whereas strong flyers were not restricted by the river network structure and were mainly assembled through mass effects.
The approach taken was sufficient to unravel the importance of dispersal and habitat connectivity on community assembly and may therefore be particularly well suited to other large data sets with isolated sites (i.e. low geographical density of sites).},

  title    = {Merging Satellite and in situ Data to Assess the Flux of Terrestrial Dissolved Organic Carbon From the Mackenzie River to the Coastal Beaufort Sea},
  year     = {2022},
  abstract = {In response to global warming, the Arctic is undergoing rapid and unprecedented changes that alter the land-to-sea forcing in large Arctic rivers. Improving our knowledge of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) flux to the coastal Arctic Ocean (AO) is thus critical and timely as these changes strongly alter the biogeochemical cycles on AO shelves. In this study, we merged riverine in situ tDOC concentrations with satellite ocean-color estimates retrieved at the land-marine interface of the Mackenzie Delta to make a first assessment of the tDOC export from its main outlets to the shelf. We combined tDOC and river discharge data to develop a regression model that simulated tDOC concentrations and fluxes from daily to interannual (2003–2017) time scales. We then compared the simulated satellite-derived estimates to those simulated by the model constrained by in situ tDOC data only. As the satellite tDOC estimates reflect the delta effect in terms of tDOC enrichment and removal, our results inform us of how much tDOC can potentially leave the delta to reach the ocean (1.44 ± 0.14 TgC.yr−1). The chemodynamic relationships and the model suggest contrasting patterns between Shallow Bay and the two easternmost delta outlets, which can be explained by the variability in their geomorphological settings. At the seasonal scale and for all outlets, the satellite-derived tDOC export departs from the estimate based on in situ tDOC data only. During the river freshet in May, the satellite-derived tDOC export is, on average, ∼15% (Shallow Bay) to ∼20% (Beluga Bay) lower than the in situ-derived estimate. This difference was the highest (−60%) in 2005 and exceeds 30% over most of the last decade, and can be explained by qualitative and quantitative differences between the tDOCin situ and tDOCsat datasets in a period when the freshet is highly variable. In contrast, in summer and fall, the satellite-derived tDOC export is higher than the in situ-derived estimate. The temporal difference between the satellite and in situ-derived export estimates suggests that predicting seasonal tDOC concentrations and fluxes from remote Arctic deltas to the coastal AO remains a challenge for assessing their impact on already changing carbon fluxes.},

		  equation on a metric tree graph to analyze persistence of a
		  single population in terms of dispersal parameters and
		  network geometry. The metric graph represents a continuous
		  network where edges represent actual domain rather than
		  connections among patches. Here, network geometry usually
		  has a significant impact on persistence, and occasionally
		  leads to dramatically altered predictions. This work ranges
		  over such themes as model definition, reduction to a
		  diffusion equation with the associated model features,
		  numerical and analytical studies in radially symmetric
		  geometries, and theoretical results for general domains.
		  Notable in the model assumptions is that the zero-flux
		  interior junction conditions are not restricted to
		  conservation of hydrological discharge.},
