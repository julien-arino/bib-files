  abstract = {Disease outbreaks in stochastic SIR epidemic models are characterized as either minor or major. When ℛ0<1, all epidemics are minor, whereas if ℛ0>1, they can be minor or major. In 1955, Whittle derived formulas for the probability of a minor or a major epidemic. A minor epidemic is distinguished from a major one in that a minor epidemic is generally of shorter duration and has substantially fewer cases than a major epidemic. In this investigation, analytical formulas are derived that approximate the probability density, the mean, and the higher-order moments for the duration of a minor epidemic. These analytical results are applicable to minor epidemics in stochastic SIR, SIS, and SIRS models with a single infected class. The probability density for minor epidemics in more complex epidemic models can be computed numerically applying multitype branching processes and the backward Kolmogorov differential equations. When ℛ0 is close to one, minor epidemics are more common than major epidemics and their duration is significantly longer than when ℛ0≪1 or ℛ0≫1.},

Although the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic has been a critical factor, the density of respiratory contacts in high-risk environments may be an important and underappreciated driver. Using a modified Wells-Riley model for airborne disease transmission, we estimated the risk of tuberculosis transmission on 3 modes of public transit (minibus taxis, buses, and trains) in Cape Town, South Africa, using exhaled carbon dioxide as a natural tracer gas to evaluate air exchange. Carbon dioxide measurements were performed between October and December of 2011. Environmental risk, reflected in the rebreathed fraction of air, was highest in minibus taxis and lowest in trains; however, the average number of passengers sharing an indoor space was highest in trains and lowest in minibus taxis. Among daily commuters, the annual risk of tuberculosis infection was projected to be 3.5\%-5.0\% and was highest among minibus taxi commuters. Assuming a duration of infectiousness of 1 year, the basic reproductive number attributable to transportation was more than 1 in all 3 modes of transportation. Given its poor ventilation and high respiratory contact rates, public transportation may play a critical role in sustaining tuberculosis transmission in South African cities.},

Condom promotion, increased TB detection and TB preventive therapy have a clear positive effect. The impact of antiretroviral therapy on the incidence of HIV is unclear and depends on the extent to which it reduces sexual transmission. However, our analysis suggests that it will greatly reduce the TB notification rate.},

The models address the use of one or two antimicrobial drugs for treating latent tuberculosis (TB). They consider the effect of varying individual immune response strength on the dynamics for the appearance of resistant bacteria. From the analysis of the models, equilibria and local stabilities are determined. For assessing temporal dynamics and global stability for sensitive and drug-resistant bacteria, numerical simulations are used. Results indicate that for a low bacteria load that is characteristic of latent TB and for small reduction in an immune response, the use of a single drug is capable of curing the infection before the appearance of drug resistance. However, for severe immune deficiency, the use of two drugs will provide a larger time period before the emergence of resistance. Therefore, in this case, two-drugs treatment will be more efficient in controlling the infection.},

This may be of importance in high-burden settings where > or =1 genetic group of M. tuberculosis confers significant morbidity.A dynamic mathematical model was constructed to evaluate how different degrees of cross-immunity among M. tuberculosis groups could affect epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB).Simulated populations with immunogenically distinct TB strain groups experienced a heightened risk of drug-resistant TB, compared with populations without such strain diversity, even when the same rates of case detection and treatment success were achieved. The highest risks of infection were observed in populations in which HIV was prevalent. Drug-resistant strains with very low transmission fitness could still propagate in environments with reduced cross-immunity among different strain groups, even after common targets for case detection and treatment success are reached.It is possible that the propagation of drug-resistant strains could depend not only on the rate of development of resistance and the fitness of the drug-resistant strains but, also, on the diversity of the strains in the region. The risk of infection with drug-resistant strains could be amplified in locations where there is reduced cross-immunity between originating strain groups. This amplification may be most profound during the first few decades of TB treatment expansion.},

While it is well recognised that overcrowding increases the risk of transmission, this increased risk has not been quantified and the relationship between overcrowding and duration of exposure is not well understood. This paper analyses three epidemiological models that have been used to predict the transmission of airborne disease in confined spaces: the Mass Action model, Riley, Murphy and Riley's model and Gammaitoni and Nucci's model. A study is presented to demonstrate the range of applicability of each model and show how they can be applied to the transmission of both TB and diseases with short incubation periods such as measles. Gammiatoni and Nucci's generalised formulation is shown to be the most suitable for modelling airborne transmission in ventilated spaces, and it is subsequently used in a parametric study to evaluate the effect of physical and environmental factors on the rate of disease transmission. The paper also presents reported quanta production data for several TB outbreaks and demonstrates that the greatest risk of TB infection is during clinical procedures that produce large quantities of aerosol, such as bronchoscopy or intubation.},

We begin by presenting an HIV/AIDS-TB coinfection model and analyze the TB and HIV/AIDS submodels separately without any intervention strategy. The TB-only model is shown to exhibit backward bifurcation when its corresponding reproduction number is less than unity. On the other hand, the HIV/AIDS-only model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when its corresponding reproduction number is less than unity. We proceed to analyze the full HIV-TB coinfection model and extend the model to incorporate antiretroviral therapy for the AIDS cases and treatment of active and latent forms of TB. The thresholds and equilibria quantities for the models are determined and stabilities analyzed. From the study we conclude that treatment of AIDS cases results in a significant reductions of numbers of individuals progressing to active TB. Further, treatment of latent and active forms of TB results in delayed onset of the AIDS stage of HIV infection.},

The model assumes that latently infected individuals develop active disease as a result of endogenous re-activation, exogenous re-infection and disease relapse, though a small fraction is assumed to develop active disease soon after infection. We start by formulating and analyzing a TB model without any intervention strategy that we extend to incorporate chemoprophylaxis and treatment of infectives. The epidemic thresholds known as reproduction numbers and equilibria for the models are determined, and stabilities analyzed. The reproduction numbers for the models are compared to assess the possible community benefits achieved by treatment of infectives, chemoprophylaxis and a holistic approach of these intervention strategies. The study shows that treatment of infectives is more effective in the first years of implementation (approximately 10 years) as treatment results in clearing active TB immediately and there after chemoprophylaxis will do better in controlling the number of infectives due to reduced progression to active TB.},

We present a new mathematical model (the amplifier model) that tracks the emergence and evolution of multiple (pre-MDR, MDR and post-MDR) strains of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We reconstruct possible evolutionary trajectories that generated hot zones over the past three decades, and identify the key causal factors. Results are consistent with recently reported World Health Organization (WHO) data. Our analyses yield three important insights. First, paradoxically we found that areas with programs that successfully reduced wild-type pansensitive strains often evolved into hot zones. Second, some hot zones emerged even when MDR strains were substantially less fit (and thus less transmissible) than wild-type pansensitive strains. Third, levels of MDR are driven by case-finding rates, cure rates and amplification probabilities. To effectively control MDRTB in the hot zones, it is essential that the WHO specify a goal for minimizing the amplification probability.},

The increase in drug-resistant cases exacerbates the control problems. Currently employed epidemic control strategies are not devised on the basis of a theoretical understanding of the transmission dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We describe and discuss a theoretical framework based upon mathematical transmission models that can be used for understanding, predicting, and controlling tuberculosis epidemics. We illustrate how the theoretical framework can be used to predict the temporal dynamics of the emergence of drug resistance, to predict the epidemiological consequences of epidemic control strategies in developing and developed countries, and to design epidemic control strategies.},

A model with a general contact rate for a disease that confers no immunity admits a unique endemic equilibrium that is globally stable. A model with mass action incidence for a disease in which infectives either die or recover with permanent immunity has the same qualitative behavior. This latter result is proved by reducing the system to an integro-differential equation. If mass action incidence is replaced by a general contact rate, then the same result is proved locally for a disease that causes fatalities. Threshold-like results are given, but in the presence of immigration of infectives there is no disease-free equilibrium. A considerable reduction of infectives is suggested by the incorporation of screening and quarantining of infectives in a model for HIV transmission in a prison system.},

  abstract    = {Mathematical models of tuberculosis (TB) transmission have been used to characterize disease dynamics, investigate the potential effects of public health interventions, and prioritize control measures. While previous work has addressed the mathematical description of TB natural history, the impact of demography on the behaviour of TB models has not been assessed.A simple model of TB transmission, with alternative assumptions about survivorship, is used to explore the effect of age structure on the prevalence of infection, disease, basic reproductive ratio and the projected impact of control interventions. We focus our analytic arguments on the differences between constant and exponentially distributed lifespans and use an individual-based model to investigate the range of behaviour arising from realistic distributions of survivorship.The choice of age structure and natural (non-disease related) mortality strongly affects steady-state dynamics, parameter estimation and predictions about the effectiveness of control interventions. Since most individuals infected with TB develop an asymptomatic latent infection and never progress to active disease, we find that assuming a constant mortality rate results in a larger reproductive ratio and an overestimation of the effort required for disease control in comparison to using more realistic age-specific mortality rates.Demographic modelling assumptions should be considered in the interpretation of models of chronic infectious diseases such as TB. For simple models, we find that assuming constant lifetimes, rather than exponential lifetimes, produces dynamics more representative of models with realistic age structure.},

Most recently developed models not only pay attention to simulations but also take care of dynamical analysis using modern knowledge of dynamical systems. Questions addressed by these models mainly concentrate on TB control strategies, optimal vaccination policies, approaches toward the elimination of TB in the U.S.A., TB co-infection with HIV/AIDS, drug-resistant TB, responses of the immune system, impacts of demography, the role of public transportation systems, and the impact of contact patterns. Model formulations involve a variety of mathematical areas, such as ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) (both autonomous and non-autonomous systems), PDEs (Partial Differential Equations), system of difference equations, system of integro-differential equations, Markov chain model, and simulation models.},

Detecting viral movement by sequence analysis is complicated by skewed geographic and seasonal distributions in viral isolates. We propose a probabilistic method that accounts for sampling bias through spatiotemporal clustering and modeling regional and seasonal transmission as a binomial process. Analysis of H3N2 not only confirmed East-Southeast Asia as a source of new seasonal variants, but also increased the resolution of observed transmission to a country level. H1N1 data revealed similar viral spread from the tropics. Network analysis suggested China and Hong Kong as the origins of new seasonal H3N2 strains and the United States as a region where increased vaccination would maximally disrupt global spread of the virus. These techniques provide a promising methodology for the analysis of any seasonal virus, as well as for the continued surveillance of influenza.},

We investigated the tuberculosis (TB) infection risks among commercial passengers by inhaled aerosol M. tuberculosis bacilli and quantify the patterns of TB transmission in Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR). A deterministic Wells-Riley mathematical model was used to account for the probability of infection risk from M. tuberculosis bacilli by linking the cough-generated aerosol M. tuberculosis bacilli concentration and particle size distribution. We found that (i) the quantum generation rate of TB was estimated with a lognormal distribution of geometric mean (GM) of 54.29 and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 3.05 quantum/h at particle size ≤ 5 μm and (ii) the basic reproduction numbers (R(0) ) were estimated to be 0.69 (0.06-6.79), 2.82 (0.32-20.97), and 2.31 (0.25-17.69) for business, standard, and nonreserved cabins, respectively. The results indicate that commercial passengers taking standard and nonreserved cabins had higher transmission risk than those in business cabins based on conservatism. Our results also reveal that even a brief exposure, as in the bronchoscopy cases, can also result in a transmission when the quantum generation rate is high. This study could contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of TB transmission in commercial passenger trains by assessing the relationship between TB infectiousness, passenger mobility, and key model parameters such as seat occupancy, ventilation rate, and exposure duration.},

In the identity level, the authors use the multi-agent-based system and the mirror identity concept to describe identities with social network features such as daily visits, long-distance movement, high degree of clustering, low degree of separation and local clustering. The research will analyse the complex dynamic mathematic model of TB epidemic and determine its stability property by using the popular Matlab/Simulink software and relative software packages. Facing the current TB epidemic situation, the development of TB and its developing trend through constructing a dynamic bio-mathematical system model of TB is investigated. After simulating the development of epidemic situation with the solution of the SMIR epidemic model, the authors will come up with a good scheme to control epidemic situation to analyse the parameter values of a model that influence epidemic situation evolved. The authors will try to find the quarantining parameters that are the most important factors to control epidemic situation.

  abstract    = {Here we present a review of the literature of influenza modeling studies, and discuss how these models can provide insights into the future of the currently circulating novel strain of influenza A (H1N1), formerly known as swine flu. We discuss how the feasibility of controlling an epidemic critically depends on the value of the Basic Reproduction Number (R0). The R0 for novel influenza A (H1N1) has recently been estimated to be between 1.4 and 1.6. This value is below values of R0 estimated for the 1918-1919 pandemic strain (mean R0 approximately 2: range 1.4 to 2.8) and is comparable to R0 values estimated for seasonal strains of influenza (mean R0 1.3: range 0.9 to 2.1). By reviewing results from previous modeling studies we conclude it is theoretically possible that a pandemic of H1N1 could be contained. However it may not be feasible, even in resource-rich countries, to achieve the necessary levels of vaccination and treatment for control. As a recent modeling study has shown, a global cooperative strategy will be essential in order to control a pandemic. This strategy will require resource-rich countries to share their vaccines and antivirals with resource-constrained and resource-poor countries. We conclude our review by discussing the necessity of developing new biologically complex models. We suggest that these models should simultaneously track the transmission dynamics of multiple strains of influenza in bird, pig and human populations. Such models could be critical for identifying effective new interventions, and informing pandemic preparedness planning. Finally, we show that by modeling cross-species transmission it may be possible to predict the emergence of pandemic strains of influenza.},

  abstract    = {Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis leads to tuberculosis (TB) disease by one of the three possible routes: primary progression after a recent infection; re-activation of a latent infection; or exogenous re-infection of a previously infected individual. Recent studies show that optimal TB control strategies may vary depending on the predominant route to disease in a specific population. It is therefore important for public health policy makers to understand the relative frequency of each type of TB within specific epidemiological scenarios. Although molecular epidemiologic tools have been used to estimate the relative contribution of recent transmission and re-activation to the burden of TB disease, it is not possible to use these techniques to distinguish between primary disease and re-infection on a population level. Current estimates of the contribution of re-infection therefore rely on mathematical models which identify the parameters most consistent with epidemiological data; these studies find that exogenous re-infection is important only when TB incidence is high. A basic assumption of these models is that people in a population are all equally likely to come into contact with an infectious case. However, theoretical studies demonstrate that the social and spatial structure can strongly influence the dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Here, we use a network model of TB transmission to evaluate the impact of non-homogeneous mixing on the relative contribution of re-infection over realistic epidemic trajectories. In contrast to the findings of previous models, our results suggest that re-infection may be important in communities where the average disease incidence is moderate or low as the force of infection can be unevenly distributed in the population. These results have important implications for the development of TB control strategies.},

  abstract    = {Recent reports of extensively drug-resistant TB in South Africa have renewed concerns that antibiotic resistance may undermine progress in TB control. We review three major questions for which mathematical models elucidate the epidemiology and control of drug-resistant TB. How is multiple drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis selected for in individuals exposed to combination chemotherapy? What factors determine the prevalence of drug-resistant TB? Which interventions to prevent the spread of drug-resistant TB are effective and feasible? Models offer insight into the acquisition and amplification of drug resistance, reveal the importance of distinguishing the intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of the reproductive capacity of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis, and demonstrate the cost effectiveness of interventions for drug-resistant TB. These models also highlight knowledge gaps for which new research will improve our ability to project trends of drug resistance and develop more effective policies for its control.},

Coinfection of a host by more than one pathogen strain may affect the relative frequency of these strains at the population level through complex within- and between-host interactions; in infectious diseases that have a long latent period, interstrain competition during latency is likely to play an important role in disease dynamics. We show that SEIR models that include a class of latently coinfected individuals can have markedly different long-term dynamics than models without coinfection, and that coinfection can greatly facilitate the stable coexistence of strains. We demonstrate these dynamics using a model relevant to tuberculosis in which people may experience latent coinfection with both drug sensitive and drug resistant strains. Using this model, we show that the existence of a latent coinfected state allows the possibility that disease control interventions that target latency may facilitate the emergence of drug resistance.},

  abstract    = {The spatial structure of populations is a key element in the understanding of the large-scale spreading of epidemics. Motivated by the recent empirical evidence on the heterogeneous properties of transportation and commuting patterns among urban areas, we present a thorough analysis of the behavior of infectious diseases in metapopulation models characterized by heterogeneous connectivity and mobility patterns. We derive the basic reaction-diffusion equations describing the metapopulation system at the mechanistic level and derive an early stage dynamics approximation for the subpopulation invasion dynamics. The analytical description uses a homogeneous assumption on degree block variables that allows us to take into account arbitrary degree distribution of the metapopulation network. We show that along with the usual single population epidemic threshold the metapopulation network exhibits a global threshold for the subpopulation invasion. We find an explicit analytic expression for the invasion threshold that determines the minimum number of individuals traveling among subpopulations in order to have the infection of a macroscopic number of subpopulations. The invasion threshold is a function of factors such as the basic reproductive number, the infectious period and the mobility process and it is found to decrease for increasing network heterogeneity. We provide extensive mechanistic numerical Monte Carlo simulations that recover the analytical finding in a wide range of metapopulation network connectivity patterns. The results can be useful in the understanding of recent data driven computational approaches to disease spreading in large transportation networks and the effect of containment measures such as travel restrictions.},

To address these issues we define a set of quantitative measures able to characterize the level of heterogeneity and predictability of the epidemic pattern.

  abstract    = {The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, which is now widespread in Southeast Asia and which diffused recently in some areas of the Balkans region and Western Europe, has raised a public alert toward the potential occurrence of a new severe influenza pandemic. Here we study the worldwide spread of a pandemic and its possible containment at a global level taking into account all available information on air travel.We studied a metapopulation stochastic epidemic model on a global scale that considers airline travel flow data among urban areas. We provided a temporal and spatial evolution of the pandemic with a sensitivity analysis of different levels of infectiousness of the virus and initial outbreak conditions (both geographical and seasonal). For each spreading scenario we provided the timeline and the geographical impact of the pandemic in 3,100 urban areas, located in 220 different countries. We compared the baseline cases with different containment strategies, including travel restrictions and the therapeutic use of antiviral (AV) drugs. We investigated the effect of the use of AV drugs in the event that therapeutic protocols can be carried out with maximal coverage for the populations in all countries. In view of the wide diversity of AV stockpiles in different regions of the world, we also studied scenarios in which only a limited number of countries are prepared (i.e., have considerable AV supplies). In particular, we compared different plans in which, on the one hand, only prepared and wealthy countries benefit from large AV resources, with, on the other hand, cooperative containment scenarios in which countries with large AV stockpiles make a small portion of their supplies available worldwide.We show that the inclusion of air transportation is crucial in the assessment of the occurrence probability of global outbreaks. The large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs in all hit countries would be able to mitigate a pandemic effect with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9 during the first year; with AV supply use sufficient to treat approximately 2\% to 6\% of the population, in conjunction with efficient case detection and timely drug distribution. For highly contagious viruses (i.e., a reproductive rate as high as 2.3), even the unrealistic use of supplies corresponding to the treatment of approximately 20\% of the population leaves 30\%-50\% of the population infected. In the case of limited AV supplies and pandemics with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9, we demonstrate that the more cooperative the strategy, the more effective are the containment results in all regions of the world, including those countries that made part of their resources available for global use.},

  abstract    = {The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic has clearly shown the importance of considering the long-range transportation networks in the understanding of emerging diseases outbreaks. The introduction of extensive transportation data sets is therefore an important step in order to develop epidemic models endowed with realism.We develop a general stochastic meta-population model that incorporates actual travel and census data among 3 100 urban areas in 220 countries. The model allows probabilistic predictions on the likelihood of country outbreaks and their magnitude. The level of predictability offered by the model can be quantitatively analyzed and related to the appearance of robust epidemic pathways that represent the most probable routes for the spread of the disease.In order to assess the predictive power of the model, the case study of the global spread of SARS is considered. The disease parameter values and initial conditions used in the model are evaluated from empirical data for Hong Kong. The outbreak likelihood for specific countries is evaluated along with the emerging epidemic pathways. Simulation results are in agreement with the empirical data of the SARS worldwide epidemic.The presented computational approach shows that the integration of long-range mobility and demographic data provides epidemic models with a predictive power that can be consistently tested and theoretically motivated. This computational strategy can be therefore considered as a general tool in the analysis and forecast of the global spreading of emerging diseases and in the definition of containment policies aimed at reducing the effects of potentially catastrophic outbreaks.},

In this paper, we investigate the role of the large-scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global propagation pattern of emerging diseases. We put forward a stochastic computational framework for the modeling of the global spreading of infectious diseases that takes advantage of the complete International Air Transport Association 2002 database complemented with census population data. The model is analyzed by using for the first time an information theory approach that allows the quantitative characterization of the heterogeneity level and the predictability of the spreading pattern in presence of stochastic fluctuations. In particular we are able to assess the reliability of numerical forecast with respect to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the disease transmission and travel flows. The epidemic pattern predictability is quantitatively determined and traced back to the occurrence of epidemic pathways defining a backbone of dominant connections for the disease spreading. The presented results provide a general computational framework for the analysis of containment policies and risk forecast of global epidemic outbreaks.},

Surveillance efforts are however incomplete especially at the early stage of an outbreak due to the ongoing learning process about the disease characteristics. An example of this is represented by the number of H1N1 influenza cases in Mexico during the first months of the current pandemic. Several estimates using backtrack calculation based on imported cases from Mexico in other countries point out that the actual number of cases was likely orders of magnitude larger than the number of confirmed cases. Realistic computational models fed with the best available estimates of the basic disease parameters can provide an ab-initio calculation of the number of cases in Mexico as other countries. Here we use the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) model to obtain estimates of the size of the epidemic in Mexico as well as of imported cases at the end of April and beginning of May. We find that the reference range for the number of cases in Mexico on April 30th is 121,000 to 1,394,000 in good agreement with the recent estimates by Lipsitch et al. [M. Lipsitch, PloS One 4:e6895 (2009)]. The number of imported cases from Mexico in several countries is found to be in good agreement with the surveillance data.},

Cellblock volumetric air flow was measured. The Wells-Riley model of airborne transmission [C = S(1-e-Iqpt/Q)] was applied to the epidemiologic and ventilation data.Statewide, of 377 sheriffs screened, 22 (5.8\%) had positive skin tests. Risk factors included older age (p < .0075) and longer tenure (p < .036). In the lock-up, of 37 sheriffs screened, 4 (10.8\%) had positive skin tests. Measured mean outside air flow per occupant (8.0 cfm; S.D. = 2.2) was below design (15 cfm) and recommended (20 cfm) standards. Mathematical modeling estimated that TB transmission would be reduced by 62.5 percent with ventilation at design specifications.Inadequate ventilation may increase the risk for occupational transmission of tuberculosis. Since lock-ups do not have the time to conduct inmate TB screenings, supplemental engineering controls may be required.},

Further, our analysis shows that transport-related infection intensifies the disease spread if infectious diseases break out to cause an endemic situation in each region, in the sense that both the absolute and relative size of patients increase. This suggests that it is very essential to strengthen restrictions of passengers once we know infectious diseases appeared.},

  abstract    = {Following primary tuberculosis (TB) infection, only approximately 10\% of individuals develop active T.B. Most people are assumed to mount an effective immune response to the initial infection that limits proliferation of the bacilli and leads to long-lasting partial immunity both to further infection and to reactivation of latent bacilli remaining from the original infection. Infected individuals may develop active TB as a consequence of exogenous reinfection, i.e., acquiring a new infection from another infectious individual. Our results in this paper suggest that exogenous reinfection has a drastic effect on the qualitative dynamics of TB. The incorporation of exogenous reinfection into our TB model allows the possibility of a subcritical bifurcation at the critical value of the basic reproductive number R(0)=1, and hence the existence of multiple endemic equilibria for R(0)<1 and the exogenous reinfection rate larger than a threshold. Our results suggest that reducing R(0) to be smaller than one may not be sufficient to eradicate the disease. An additional reduction in reinfection rate may be required. These results may also partially explain the recently observed resurgence of TB.},

There is evidence to believe the main factor for this resurgence has been the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Co-infection with HIV and M. Tuberculosis has profound implications for the course of both diseases. This study represents a first attempt to understand how the introduction of an opportunistic infection, namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes TB, affects the dynamic interaction of HIV-1 and the immune system. We create a mathematical model using ordinary differential equations to describe the interaction of HIV and TB with the immune system. It is known that infection with TB can decrease the CD4(+) T cell counts-a key marker of AIDS progression; thus, it shortens survival in HIV infected individuals. Another main marker for HIV progression is the viral load. If this load is increased due to the presence of opportunistic infections, the disease progression is much more rapid. We also explore the effects of drug treatment on the TB infection in the doubly-infected patient.},

  abstract    = {Viruses contained in live-attenuated virus vaccines (LAVV) can be transmitted between individuals, resulting in secondary or contact vaccinations. This fact has been exploited successfully in the use of the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to better control wild-type polio viruses. In this work we analyze general LAVV vaccination models for infections that confer lifelong immunity. We consider both standard (continuous) vaccination strategies and pulse vaccination programs (where mass vaccination is carried out at regular intervals). For continuous vaccination, we provide a complete global analysis of a very general compartmental ordinary differential equation LAVV model. We find that the threshold vaccination level required for the eradication of wild-type virus depends on the basic reproduction numbers of both the wild-type and vaccine viruses, but is otherwise independent of the distributions of the durations in each of the sequence of stages of disease progression (e.g., latent, infectious, etc.). Furthermore, even for vaccine viruses with reproduction numbers below one, which would naturally fade from the population upon cessation of vaccination, there can be a significant reduction in the threshold vaccination level. The dependence of the threshold vaccination level on the virus reproduction numbers largely generalizes to the pulse vaccination model. For shorter pulsing periods there is negligible difference in threshold vaccination level as compared to continuous vaccination campaigns. Thus, we conclude that current policy in many countries to employ annual pulsed OPV vaccination does not significantly diminish the benefits of contact vaccination.},

However, there is no consensus on how many cities should be selected or on how to select those cities. Using airport flight data that commercial airlines reported to the Official Airline Guide (OAG) in 2000, we have examined the network characteristics of network samples obtained under different selection rules. In addition, we have examined different size samples based on largest flight volume and largest metropolitan populations. We have shown that although the bias in network characteristics increases with the reduction of the sample size, a relatively small number of areas that includes the largest airports, the largest cities, the most-connected cities, and the most central cities is enough to describe the dynamics of the global spread of influenza. The analysis suggests that a relatively small number of cities (around 200 or 300 out of almost 3000) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the global spread of a disease such as influenza. Weak traffic flows between small airports can contribute to noise and mask other means of spread such as the ground transportation.},

Multiple drug resistance is often attributed to sequential functional monotherapy, and standard initial treatment regimens have therefore been designed to include simultaneous use of four different antibiotics. Despite the widespread use of combination therapy, highly resistant M. tb strains have emerged in many settings. Here we use a stochastic birth-death model to estimate the probability of the emergence of multidrug resistance during the growth of a population of initially drug sensitive TB bacilli within an infected host. We find that the probability of the emergence of resistance to the two principal anti-TB drugs before initiation of therapy ranges from 10(-5) to 10(-4); while rare, this is several orders of magnitude higher than previous estimates. This finding suggests that multidrug resistant M. tb may not be an entirely "man-made" phenomenon and may help explain how highly drug resistant forms of TB have independently emerged in many settings.},

Explanatory variables include baseline TB incidence, interval between PACF rounds, and different routine and PACF case-detection rates among HIV-infected and uninfected TB cases.PACF can be cost-saving over a 10 year time frame if the cost-per-round is lower than a threshold proportional to initial incidence and cost-per-case-treated. More cases are averted at higher baseline incidence rates, when more potent PACF strategies are used, intervals between PACF rounds are shorter, and when the ratio of HIV-negative to positive TB cases detected is higher. More costly approaches, e.g. radiographic screening, can be as cost-effective as less costly alternatives if PACF case-detection is higher and/or implementation less frequent.Periodic ACF can both improve control and save medium-term health care costs in high TB burden settings. Greater costs of highly effective PACF at frequent (e.g. yearly) intervals may be offset by higher numbers of cases averted in populations with high baseline TB incidence, higher prevalence of HIV-uninfected cases, higher costs per-case-treated, and more effective routine case-detection. Less intensive approaches may still be cost-neutral or cost-saving in populations lacking one or more of these key determinants.},

Mathematical models can be used to explore different scenarios and provide insight into potential costs, benefits, and effectiveness of prevention and control strategies under consideration.A stochastic, equation-based epidemic model is used to study global transmission of pandemic flu, including the effects of travel restrictions and vaccination. Economic costs of intervention are also considered. The distribution of First Passage Times (FPT) to the United States and the numbers of infected persons in metropolitan areas worldwide are studied assuming various times and locations of the initial outbreak. International air travel restrictions alone provide a small delay in FPT to the U.S. When other containment measures are applied at the source in conjunction with travel restrictions, delays could be much longer. If in addition, control measures are instituted worldwide, there is a significant reduction in cases worldwide and specifically in the U.S. However, if travel restrictions are not combined with other measures, local epidemic severity may increase, because restriction-induced delays can push local outbreaks into high epidemic season. The per annum cost to the U.S. economy of international and major domestic air passenger travel restrictions is minimal: on the order of 0.8\% of Gross National Product.International air travel restrictions may provide a small but important delay in the spread of a pandemic, especially if other disease control measures are implemented during the afforded time. However, if other measures are not instituted, delays may worsen regional epidemics by pushing the outbreak into high epidemic season. This important interaction between policy and seasonality is only evident with a global-scale model. Since the benefit of travel restrictions can be substantial while their costs are minimal, dismissal of travel restrictions as an aid in dealing with a global pandemic seems premature.},

  abstract    = {New strains of influenza spread around the globe via the movement of infected individuals. The global dynamics of influenza are complicated by different patterns of influenza seasonality in different regions of the world. We have released an open-source stochastic mathematical model of the spread of influenza across 321 major, strategically located cities of the world. Influenza is transmitted between cities via infected airline passengers. Seasonality is simulated by increasing the transmissibility in each city at the times of the year when influenza has been observed to be most prevalent. The spatiotemporal spread of pandemic influenza can be understood through clusters of global transmission and links between them, which we identify using the epidemic percolation network (EPN) of the model. We use the model to explain the observed global pattern of spread for pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009-2010 (pandemic H1N1 2009) and to examine possible global patterns of spread for future pandemics depending on the origin of pandemic spread, time of year of emergence, and basic reproductive number (). We also use the model to investigate the effectiveness of a plausible global distribution of vaccine for various pandemic scenarios. For pandemic H1N1 2009, we show that the biggest impact of vaccination was in the temperate northern hemisphere. For pandemics starting in the temperate northern hemisphere in May or April, vaccination would have little effect in the temperate southern hemisphere and a small effect in the tropics. With the increasing interconnectedness of the world's population, we must take a global view of infectious disease transmission. Our open-source, computationally simple model can help public health officials plan for the next pandemic as well as deal with interpandemic influenza.},

  abstract    = {Tuberculosis (TB) in prisons is a major health problem in countries of high and intermediate TB endemicity such as Brazil. For operational reasons, TB control strategies in prisons cannot be compared through population based intervention studies.A mathematical model is proposed to simulate the TB dynamics in prison and evaluate the potential impact on active TB prevalence of several intervention strategies. The TB dynamics with the ongoing program was simulated over a 10 year period in a Rio de Janeiro prison (TB prevalence 4.6 \%). Then, a simulation of the DOTS strategy reaching the objective of 70 \% of bacteriologically-positive cases detected and 85 \% of detected cases cured was performed; this strategy reduced only to 2.8\% the average predicted TB prevalence after 5 years. Adding TB detection at entry point to DOTS strategy had no major effect on the predicted active TB prevalence. But, adding further a yearly X-ray mass screening of inmates reduced the predicted active TB prevalence below 1\%. Furthermore, according to this model, after applying this strategy during 2 years (three annual screenings), the TB burden would be reduced and the active TB prevalence could be kept at a low level by associating X-ray screening at entry point and DOTS.We have shown that X-ray mass screenings should be considered to control TB in highly endemic prison. Prisons with different levels of TB prevalence could be examined thanks to this model which provides a rational tool for public health deciders.},

Due to slow progression of tuberculosis, the transmission dynamics and its long-term effects can often be better observed and predicted using simulations of epidemiological models. This study provides a review of earlier study on modeling different aspects of tuberculosis dynamics. The models simulate tuberculosis transmission dynamics, treatment, drug resistance, control strategies for increasing compliance to treatment, HIV/TB co-infection, and patient groups. The models are based on various mathematical systems, such as systems of ordinary differential equations, simulation models, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The inferences from the models are justified by case studies and statistical analysis of TB patient datasets.},

Epidemiological time scales are used to reduce the dimensionality of the model and singular perturbation methods are used to corroborate the results of time-scale approximations. The concept and impact of optimal average cluster or generalized household size on TB dynamics is discussed. We also discuss the potential impact of our results on the spread of TB.},

The existence of 'super' food-rich patch is proved to be sufficient to ensure partial permanence of the model. It is also shown that partial permanence implies permanence if each food-poor patch is chained to the super food-rich patch. Furthermore, it is proven that partial persistence is ensured if there exist food-rich patches and the dispersion of the species among the patches are small. When the dispersion is large, the partial persistence is realized under relatively small dispersion time.},

An increase in TB cases was reported, however, in 1986, and an upward trend in TB incidence has continued. The turnaround in TB is well correlated with the rise of the HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) epidemic. The purpose of this work is to investigate, through the use of mathematical models, the magnitude and duration of the effect that the HIV epidemic may have on TB. Models are developed which reflect the transmission dynamics of both TB and HIV, and the relative merits of these models are discussed. The models are then linked together to form a model for the combined spread of both diseases. A numerical study is performed to investigate the influence of certain key parameters. The effect that HIV will have on the general population is found to be dependent on the contact structure between the general population and the HIV risk groups, as well as a possible shift in the dynamics associated with TB transmission.},

  abstract    = {The resurgence of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in some parts of Europe and North America calls for a mathematical study to assess the impact of the emergence and spread of such strain on the global effort to effectively control the burden of tuberculosis. This paper presents a deterministic compartmental model for the transmission dynamics of two strains of tuberculosis, a drug-sensitive (wild) one and a multi-drug-resistant strain. The model allows for the assessment of the treatment of people infected with the wild strain. The qualitative analysis of the model reveals the following. The model has a disease-free equilibrium, which is locally asymptotically stable if a certain threshold, known as the effective reproduction number, is less than unity. Further, the model undergoes a backward bifurcation, where the disease-free equilibrium coexists with a stable endemic equilibrium. One of the main novelties of this study is the numerical illustration of tri-stable equilibria, where the disease-free equilibrium coexists with two stable endemic equilibrium when the aforementioned threshold is less than unity, and a bi-stable setup, involving two stable endemic equilibria, when the effective reproduction number is greater than one. This, to our knowledge, is the first time such dynamical features have been observed in TB dynamics. Finally, it is shown that the backward bifurcation phenomenon in this model arises due to the exogenous re-infection property of tuberculosis.},

The World Health Organization reports about 9.2 million new infections each year, with an average of 1.7 million people killed by the disease. The causative agent is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), whose main target are the macrophages, important immune system cells. Macrophages and T cell populations are the main responsible for fighting the pathogen. A better understanding of the interaction between Mtb, macrophages and T cells will contribute to the design of strategies to control TB. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the response of T cells and macrophages in the control of Mtb. To this end, we propose a system of ordinary differential equations to model the interaction among non-infected macrophages, infected macrophages, T cells and Mtb bacilli. Model analysis reveals the existence of two equilibrium states, infection-free equilibrium and the endemically infected equilibrium which can represent a state of latent or active infection, depending on the amount of bacteria.},

  abstract    = {This work elaborates on the effects of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) and other immune mechanisms in determining whether a TB-infected individual will develop active or latent TB. It answers one intriguing question: why do individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) experience different clinical outcomes? In addressing this question, we have developed a model that captures the effects of CTLs and the combined effects of CD4+ helper T cells (Th1 and Th2) immune response mechanisms to TB infection. The occurrence of active or latent infection is shown to depend on a number of factors that include effector function and levels of CTLs. We use the model to predict disease progression scenarios, including primary, latency or clearance. Model analysis shows that occurrence of active disease is much attributed to the Mtb pathogen ability to persist outside the intracellular environment and that high levels of CTLs result in latent TB, while low levels of CTLs result in active TB. This is attributed to the CTLs' ability to directly kill infected macrophages and the bacteria inside the infected macrophages. The study suggests directions for further basic studies and potential new treatment strategies.},

  abstract    = {Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The study of the joint dynamics of HIV and TB present formidable mathematical challenges due to the fact that the models of transmission are quite distinct. Furthermore, although there is overlap in the populations at risk of HIV and TB infections, the magnitude of the proportion of individuals at risk for both diseases is not known. Here, we consider a highly simplified deterministic model that incorporates the joint dynamics of TB and HIV, a model that is quite hard to analyze. We compute independent reproductive numbers for TB (R1) and HIV (R2) and the overall reproductive number for the system, R=max{R1, R2}. The focus is naturally (given the highly simplified nature of the framework) on the qualitative analysis of this model. We find that if R < 1 then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. The TB-only equilibrium ET is locally asymptotically stable if R1 < 1 and R2 < 1. However, the symmetric condition, R1 < 1 and R2 > 1, does not necessarily guarantee the stability of the HIV-only equilibrium EH, and it is possible that TB can coexist with HIV when R2 > 1. In other words, in the case when R1 < 1 and R2 > 1 (or when R1 > 1 and R2 > 1), we are able to find a stable HIV/TB coexistence equilibrium. Moreover, we show that the prevalence level of TB increases with R2 > 1 under certain conditions. Through simulations, we find that i) the increased progression rate from latent to active TB in co-infected individuals may play a significant role in the rising prevalence of TB; and ii) the increased progression rates from HIV to AIDS have not only increased the prevalence level of HIV while decreasing TB prevalence, but also generated damped oscillations in the system.},

  abstract    = {The HIV/AIDS epidemic, one of the leading public health problems to have affected sub-Sahara Africa, is a multifaceted problem with social, behavioral and biological aspects. In the absence of a cure, behavioral change has been advocated as an intervention strategy for reversing the epidemic. Empirical studies have found heavy alcohol consumption to be a fueling factor for HIV/AIDS infection and progression. Previously [20], we formulated and analyzed a one-sex deterministic model to capture the dynamics of this deadly interaction. But, since alcohol drinking habits, consequent risky sexual practices, alcohol-induced immune suppression, etc., can be different for men and women, the primary objective of our present paper is to construct a two-sex model aimed at shedding light on how both sexes, with varying heavy alcohol consumption trends, contribute differently to the HIV/AIDS spread. Based on numerical simulations, supported by the UNAIDS epidemiological software SPECTRUM and using the available data, our study identifies heavy drinking among men and women to be a major driving force for HIV/AIDS in Botswana and sub-Sahara Africa and quantifies its hazardous outcomes in terms of increased number of active TB cases and economic burden caused by increased need for AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART). Our simulations point to the heavy-drinking habits of men as a major reason for the continuing disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on women in sub-Sahara Africa. Our analysis has revealed the possibility of the phenomenon of backward bifurcation. In contrast to the result in some HIV vaccination models [52], backward bifurcation in our model is not removed by replacing the corresponding standard incidence function with a mass action incidence, but is removed by merging the two susceptible classes of the same sex into one, i.e., by ignoring acquisition of, and ongoing recovery from, heavy-drinking habits among the susceptible population.},

  abstract  = {We propose and analyze, a nonlinear mathematical model of the spread of HIV/AIDS in a population of varying size with immigration of infectives. It is assumed that susceptibles become infected via sexual contacts with infectives (also assumed to be infectious) and all infectives ultimately develop AIDS. The model is studied using stability theory of differential equations and computer simulation. Model dynamics is also discussed under two particular cases when there is no direct inflow of infectives. On analyzing these situations, it is found that the disease is always persistent if the direct immigration of infectives is allowed in the community. Further, in the absence of inflow of infectives, the endemicity of the disease is found to be higher if pre-AIDS individuals also interact sexually in comparison to the case when they do not take part in sexual interactions. Thus, if the direct immigration of infectives is restricted, the spread of infection can be slowed down. A numerical study of the model is also carried out to investigate the influence of certain key parameters on the spread of the disease.},

The resulting 3D and 4D non-linear systems depending on some parameters, which reflect 'measures' of factors under consideration, support rich dynamics and in particular a diverse number of predator-prey life history outcomes. The model's mathematical analysis is carried out via submodels that focus in lower-dimensional settings. The outcomes depend on and, in fact, are quite sensitive to the structure of the system, the range of parameter values and initial conditions. We show that the system can support multistability and a diverse set of predator-prey life-history dynamics that include rather complex dynamical system outcomes. It is argued that, in general, evolution should favour heterogeneous settings including Allee effects, prey refuges and patch-specific predators.},

Current in vitro models of TB, while valuable, are poor predictors of the antibacterial effect of drugs in vivo. Mathematical models may be useful to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches in TB research. The objective of this study was to set up a prototype mathematical model of TB treatment by rifampin, based on pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and disease submodels. The full mathematical model can simulate the time-course of tuberculous disease from the first day of infection to the last day of therapy. Therapeutic simulations were performed with the full model to study the antibacterial effect of various dosage regimens of rifampin in lungs. The model reproduced some qualitative and quantitative properties of the bactericidal activity of rifampin observed in clinical data. The kill curves simulated with the model showed a typical biphasic decline in the number of extracellular bacteria consistent with observations in TB patients. Simulations performed with more simple pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models indicated a possible role of a protected intracellular bacterial compartment in such a biphasic decline. This modeling effort strongly suggests that current dosage regimens of RIF may be further optimized. In addition, it suggests a new hypothesis for bacterial persistence during TB treatment.},

Considering the time for them to obtain immunity and the possibility for them to be infected before this, two SVIR models are established to describe continuous vaccination strategy and pulse vaccination strategy (PVS), respectively. It is shown that both systems exhibit strict threshold dynamics which depend on the basic reproduction number. If this number is below unity, the disease can be eradicated. And if it is above unity, the disease is endemic in the sense of global asymptomatic stability of a positive equilibrium for continuous vaccination strategy and disease permanence for PVS. Mathematical results suggest that vaccination is helpful for disease control by decreasing the basic reproduction number. However, there is a necessary condition for successful elimination of disease. If the time for the vaccinees to obtain immunity or the possibility for them to be infected before this is neglected, this condition disappears and the disease can always be eradicated by some suitable vaccination strategies. This may lead to over-evaluating the effect of vaccination.},

  abstract    = {The majority of individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli develop latent infection. Mtb becomes dormant and phenotypically drug resistant when it encounters multiple stresses within the host, and expresses a set of genes, known as the dormancy regulon, in vivo. These genes are expressed in vitro in response to nitric oxide (NO), hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), and nutrient starvation. The occurrence and reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB) is not clearly understood. The ability of the pathogen to enter and exit from different states is associated with its ability to cause persistent infection. During infection it is not known whether the organism is in a persistent slow replicating state or a dormant non-replicating state, with the latter ultimately causing a latent infection with the potential to reactivate to active disease. We collected gene expression data for Mtb bacilli under different stress conditions that simulate latency or dormancy. Time course experiments were selected and differentially expressed gene profiles were determined at each time point. A mathematical model was then developed to show the dynamics of Mtb latency based on the profile of differentially expressed genes. Analysis of the time course data show the dynamics of latency occurrence in vitro and the mathematical model reveals all possible scenarios of Mtb latency development with respect to the different conditions that may be produced by the immune response in vivo. The mathematical model provides a biological explanation of how Mtb latency occurs based on observed gene expression changes in in vitro latency models.},

In previous work, we introduced the framework for a mathematical model of epidemic TB in demographically distinct, heterogeneous populations. Simulations showed the importance of genetic susceptibility in determining endemic prevalence levels. In the work presented here, we include treatment and investigate different strategies for treatment of latent and active TB disease in heterogeneous populations. We illustrate how the presence of a genetically susceptible subpopulation dramatically alters effects of treatment in the same way a core population does in the setting of sexually transmitted diseases. In addition, we evaluate treatment strategies that focus specifically on this subpopulation, and our results indicate that genetically susceptible subpopulations should be accounted for when designing treatment strategies to achieve the greatest reduction in disease prevalence.},

The overall effect of these factors on the basic reproduction number under treatment, R(T), of the TB model was considered. In all, a serious concentration on tuberculosis awareness programmes and active cough identification as a marker for someone having TB was shown to significantly reduce the value of the reproduction number, hereby reducing the severity of the disease in the presence of treatment.},

Respirable pathogen-carrying droplets provide a vector for the spatial spread of infection with droplet transport determined by diffusive and convective processes. An epidemiological model describing the spatial dynamics of disease transmission is presented. The effects of an ambient airflow, as an infection control, are incorporated leading to a delay equation, with droplet density dependent on the infectious density at a previous time. It is found that small droplets (∼0.4μm) generate a negligible infectious force due to the small viral load and the associated duration they require to transmit infection. In contrast, larger droplets (∼4μm) can lead to an infectious wave propagating through a fully susceptible population or a secondary infection outbreak for a localized susceptible population. Droplet diffusion is found to be an inefficient mode of droplet transport leading to minimal spatial spread of infection. A threshold air velocity is derived, above which disease transmission is impaired even when the basic reproduction number R(0) exceeds unity.},

The observed data from the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) shows a certain rise of active-TB incidence individuals after 2001 yr. Because of this sudden jump, we have considered two different periods for best fitting the model: prior to 2001 yr and posterior to 2001 yr. The least-squares fitting has been used for estimating model parameters to the observed data of active-TB incidence. Our model agrees well with the observed data. In this work, we also propose optimal treatment strategies of TB model in South Korea for the future. We have considered three control mechanisms representing distancing, case finding and case holding efforts. Optimal control programs have been proposed in various scenarios, in order to minimize the number of exposed and infectious individuals and the cost of implementing the control treatment.},

One target is to eliminate TB by 2050; that is, to cut the annual incidence of new cases to less than 1 per million population. National TB control programmes are working to eliminate TB mainly by intensifying efforts to find and cure patients with active disease. Here, we use mathematical modelling to show that, while most TB patients can be cured with present drug regimens, the 2050 target is far more likely to be achieved with a combination of diagnostics, drugs and vaccines that can detect and treat both latent infection and active disease. We find that the coupling of control methods is particularly effective because treatments for latent infection and active disease act in synergy. This synergistic effect offers new perspectives on the cost-effectiveness of treating latent TB infection and the impact of possible new TB vaccines. Our results should be a stimulus to those who develop, manufacture and implement new technology for TB control, and to their financial donors.},

  abstract    = {We present a combined epidemiological and economic model for control of diseases spreading on local and small-world networks. The disease is characterized by a pre-symptomatic infectious stage that makes detection and control of cases more difficult. The effectiveness of local (ring-vaccination or culling) and global control strategies is analysed by comparing the net present values of the combined cost of preventive treatment and illness. The optimal strategy is then selected by minimizing the total cost of the epidemic. We show that three main strategies emerge, with treating a large number of individuals (global strategy, GS), treating a small number of individuals in a well-defined neighbourhood of a detected case (local strategy) and allowing the disease to spread unchecked (null strategy, NS). The choice of the optimal strategy is governed mainly by a relative cost of palliative and preventive treatments. If the disease spreads within the well-defined neighbourhood, the local strategy is optimal unless the cost of a single vaccine is much higher than the cost associated with hospitalization. In the latter case, it is most cost-effective to refrain from prevention. Destruction of local correlations, either by long-range (small-world) links or by inclusion of many initial foci, expands the range of costs for which the NS is most cost-effective. The GS emerges for the case when the cost of prevention is much lower than the cost of treatment and there is a substantial non-local component in the disease spread. We also show that local treatment is only desirable if the disease spreads on a small-world network with sufficiently few long-range links; otherwise it is optimal to treat globally. In the mean-field case, there are only two optimal solutions, to treat all if the cost of the vaccine is low and to treat nobody if it is high. The basic reproduction ratio, R(0), does not depend on the rate of responsive treatment in this case and the disease always invades (but might be stopped afterwards). The details of the local control strategy, and in particular the optimal size of the control neighbourhood, are determined by the epidemiology of the disease. The properties of the pathogen might not be known in advance for emerging diseases, but the broad choice of the strategy can be made based on economic analysis only.},

  abstract    = {Rubella is generally a mild childhood disease, but infection during early pregnancy may cause spontaneous abortion or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which may entail a variety of birth defects. Since vaccination at levels short of those necessary to achieve eradication may increase the average age of infection, and thus potentially the CRS burden, introduction of the vaccine has been limited to contexts where coverage is high. Recent work suggests that spatial heterogeneity in coverage should also be a focus of concern. Here, we use a detailed dataset from South Africa to explore the implications of heterogeneous vaccination for the burden of CRS, introducing realistic vaccination scenarios based on reported levels of measles vaccine coverage. Our results highlight the potential impact of country-wide reductions of incidence of rubella on the local CRS burdens in districts with small population sizes. However, simulations indicate that if rubella vaccination is introduced with coverage reflecting current estimates for measles coverage in South Africa, the burden of CRS is likely to be reduced overall over a 30 year time horizon by a factor of 3, despite the fact that this coverage is lower than the traditional 80 per cent rule of thumb for vaccine introduction, probably owing to a combination of relatively low birth and transmission rates. We conclude by discussing the likely impact of private-sector vaccination.},

The air is distributed in the room according to different principles: mixing ventilation, displacement ventilation, etc. A large amount of air is supplied to the room to ensure a dilution of airborne infection. Analyses of the flow in the room show that there are a number of parameters that play an important role in minimizing airborne cross-infection. The air flow rate to the room must be high, and the air distribution pattern can be designed to have high ventilation effectiveness. Furthermore, personalized ventilation may reduce the risk of cross-infection, and in some cases, it can also reduce the source of infection. Personalized ventilation can especially be used in hospital wards, aircraft cabins and, in general, where people are in fixed positions.},

  abstract    = {Understanding the risk of airborne transmission can provide important information for designing safe healthcare environments with an appropriate level of environmental control for mitigating risks. The most common approach for assessing risk is to use the Wells-Riley equation to relate infectious cases to human and environmental parameters. While it is a simple model that can yield valuable information, the model used as in its original presentation has a number of limitations. This paper reviews recent developments addressing some of the limitations including coupling with epidemic models to evaluate the wider impact of control measures on disease progression, linking with zonal ventilation or computational fluid dynamics simulations to deal with imperfect mixing in real environments and recent work on dose-response modelling to simulate the interaction between pathogens and the host. A stochastic version of the Wells-Riley model is presented that allows consideration of the effects of small populations relevant in healthcare settings and it is demonstrated how this can be linked to a simple zonal ventilation model to simulate the influence of proximity to an infector. The results show how neglecting the stochastic effects present in a real situation could underestimate the risk by 15 per cent or more and that the number and rate of new infections between connected spaces is strongly dependent on the airflow. Results also indicate the potential danger of using fully mixed models for future risk assessments, with quanta values derived from such cases less than half the actual source value.},

  abstract    = {In a significant number of instances, an episode of tuberculosis can be attributed to a reinfection event. Because reinfection is more likely in high incidence regions than in regions of low incidence, more tuberculosis (TB) cases due to reinfection could be expected in high-incidence regions than in low-incidence regions. Empirical data from regions with various incidence rates appear to confirm the conjecture that, in fact, the incidence rate due to reinfection only, as a proportion of all cases, correlates with the logarithm of the incidence rate, rather than with the incidence rate itself. A theoretical model that supports this conjecture is presented. A Markov model was used to obtain a relationship between incidence and reinfection rates. It was assumed in this model that the rate of reinfection is a multiple, rho (the reinfection factor), of the rate of first-time infection, lambda. The results obtained show a relationship between the proportion of cases due to reinfection and the rate of incidence that is approximately logarithmic for a range of values of the incidence rate typical of those observed in communities across the globe. A value of rho is determined such that the relationship between the proportion of cases due to reinfection and the logarithm of the incidence rate closely correlates with empirical data. From a purely theoretical investigation, it is shown that a simple relationship can be expected between the logarithm of the incidence rates and the proportions of cases due to reinfection after a prior episode of TB. This relationship is sustained by a rate of reinfection that is higher than the rate of first-time infection and this latter consideration underscores the great importance of monitoring recovered TB cases for repeat disease episodes, especially in regions where TB incidence is high. Awareness of this may assist in attempts to control the epidemic.},

For the main phase of transmission of the epidemic, July-October 1916, it is shown that the maximum concentration of activity of poliomyelitis occurred within a 128-km radius of New York City. Although the integrity of the poliomyelitis cluster was maintained up to approximately 500 km from the metropolitan focus, the level and rate of propagation of disease declined with distance from the origin of the epidemic. Finally, it is shown that the geographical transmission of the epidemic in north-eastern USA probably followed a process of mixed contagious-hierarchical diffusion.},

A TB model that considers the existence of a new class (mainly in the African context) is considered: the lost to follow up individuals. Based on the model formulated and studied in the work of Plaire Tchinda Mouofo, (2009), the TB control is formulated and solved as an optimal control theory problem using the Pontryagin's maximum principle (Pontryagin et al., 1992). This control strategy indicates how the control of the lost to follow up class can considerably influence the basic reproduction ratio so as to reduce the number of lost to follow up. Numerical results show the performance of the optimization strategy.},

  abstract    = {Poliomyelitis vaccination via live Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) suffers from the inherent problem of reversion: the vaccine may, upon replication in the human gut, mutate back to virulence and transmissibility resulting in circulating vaccine derived polio viruses (cVDPVs). We formulate a general mathematical model to assess the impact of cVDPVs on prospects for polio eradication. We find that for OPV coverage levels below a certain threshold, cVDPVs have a small impact in comparison to the expected endemic level of the disease in the absence of reversion. Above this threshold, the model predicts a small but significant endemic level of the disease, even where standard models predict eradication. In light of this, we consider and analyze three alternative eradication strategies involving a transition from continuous OPV vaccination to either continuous Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV), pulsed OPV vaccination, or a one-time IPV pulse vaccination. Stochastic modeling shows continuous IPV vaccination is effective at achieving eradication for moderate coverage levels, while pulsed OPV is effective if higher coverage levels are maintained. The one-time pulse IPV method may also be a viable strategy, especially in terms of the number of vaccinations required and time to eradication, provided that a sufficiently large pulse is practically feasible. More investigation is needed regarding the frequency of revertant virus infection resulting directly from vaccination, the ability of IPV to induce gut immunity, and the potential role of spatial transmission dynamics in eradication efforts.},

Bailey has considered a stochastic epidemic model of the type set up by Bartlett (1949), and has shown that the probability distribution (Pw) of the ultimate number of infected individuals (w) may be calculated by solving a certain set of doubly recurrent relations. I propose to show that for quite a general case these same probabilities may be obtained by the solution of a set of singly recurrent relations (eqs. (17) and (24)). Furthermore, an expression may be derived (eqs. (38) and (40)) for the probability that an infection introduced into a large population will ‘take’—this provides a stochastic equivalent to Kermack \\&amp; McKendrick's threshold theorem (1927 and later).}},

Aerosol dispersion, heat and mass transfer, deposition in the respiratory tract, and infection mechanisms are discussed, with an emphasis on experimental and modeling approaches. Key building design parameters are described that include types of ventilation systems (mixing, displacement, natural and hybrid), air exchange rate, temperature and relative humidity, air flow distribution structure, occupancy, engineered disinfection of air (filtration and UV radiation), and architectural programming (source and activity management) for health care facilities. The paper describes major findings and suggests future research needs in methods for ventilation design of health care facilities to prevent airborne infection risk.},

Such variability can be important when estimating concentrations involving small numbers of contaminant particles. This article describes the use of probabilistic models termed Markov chains to account for a portion of this variability. The deterministic and Markov models are related in that the former provide the expected concentration values. To explain this relationship, a single-zone (well-mixed room) scenario is described as a Markov chain. Subsequently, a two-zone room is cast as a Markov model, and the latter is applied to assessing a health care worker's risk of tuberculosis infection. Airborne particles carrying Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are usually present in small numbers in a room occupied by an infectious tuberculosis patient. For a given scenario, the Markov model permits estimates of variability in exposure intensity and the resulting variability in infection risk.},

  abstract    = {Polio eradication is on the cusp of success, with only a few regions still maintaining transmission. Improving our understanding of why some regions have been successful and others have not will help with both global eradication of polio and development of more effective vaccination strategies for other pathogens. To examine the past 25 years of eradication efforts, we constructed a transmission model for wild poliovirus that incorporates waning immunity (which affects both infection risk and transmissibility of any resulting infection), age-mediated vaccination rates, and transmission of oral polio vaccine. The model produces results consistent with the 4 country categories defined by the Global Polio Eradication Program: elimination with no subsequent outbreaks; elimination with subsequent transient outbreaks; elimination with subsequent outbreaks and transmission detected for more than 12 months; and endemic polio transmission. Analysis of waning immunity rates and oral polio vaccine transmissibility reveals that higher waning immunity rates make eradication more difficult because of increasing numbers of infectious adults, and that higher oral polio vaccine transmission rates make eradication easier as adults become reimmunized. Given these dynamic properties, attention should be given to intervention strategies that complement childhood vaccination. For example, improvement in sanitation can reduce the reproduction number in problematic regions, and adult vaccination can lower adult transmission.},

  abstract    = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockade increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB). The purpose of this study was to use Markov modeling to examine the contributions of reactivation of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) and the progression of new infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis to active TB due to TNF blockade. These 2 pathogenic mechanisms cannot otherwise be readily distinguished.Monte Carlo simulation was used to represent the range of reported values for the incidence of TB associated with infliximab (TNF monoclonal antibody) and etanercept (soluble TNF receptor) therapy. Iterative methods were then used to identify for each pair of incidence rates the Markov model parameters that most accurately represented the distribution of time to onset of TB as reported to the Food and Drug Administration.Modeling revealed an apparent median monthly rate of reactivation of LTBI by infliximab treatment of 20.8\%, which was 12.1 times that with etanercept treatment (P<0.001). In contrast, both drugs appeared to pose a high risk of progression of new M tuberculosis infection to active TB. Progression of new infection appeared to cause nearly half of the etanercept-associated cases; it became the predominant cause of infliximab-associated cases only after the first year.Despite sharing a common therapeutic target, infliximab and etanercept differ markedly in the rates at which they reactivate LTBI. Confirmation of these findings will require the application of molecular epidemiologic tools to studies of TB in future biologics registries. Hidden Markov modeling and Monte Carlo simulation are powerful tools for revealing otherwise hidden aspects of the pathogenesis of TB.},

The major factor that limits the effectiveness of most respirators is the leakage between the face and the mask. There are data suggesting that traditional fit testing of respirators does not adequately predict the degree of protection in actual use, and more research is needed in that area. There is a large range of infectiousness of aerosols of TB, and classes of respirators vary greatly in the degree of protection they offer. I have argued that respirator selection should be based on anticipated exposures. High-risk exposures to TB are often associated with cough-inducing procedures or with aerosolization of infected tissues during autopsies. In my opinion, the most reasonable type of respirator for such high-risk situations in health care settings is a PAPR hood. The concentration of infectious aerosols in well-ventilated respiratory isolation rooms is likely to be very low, and the new N95 respirators offer a reasonable balance of comfort, cost, practicality, and protection. Preliminary data from mathematical modeling studies suggest there may be little additional benefit from more sophisticated personal respiratory protection in such settings. Additional research is needed to more accurately assess exposures to TB, to determine the size and aerodynamic behavior of TB generated by infectious patients, and to more accurately define the role and effectiveness of personal respiratory protection against TB.},

These advances have put in evidence the limits of homogeneous assumptions and simple spatial diffusion approaches, and stimulated the inclusion of complex features and heterogeneities relevant in the description of epidemic diffusion. In this paper, we review recent progresses that integrate complex systems and networks analysis with epidemic modelling and focus on the impact of the various complex features of real systems on the dynamics of epidemic spreading.},

While they destroy pathogenic M. tuberculosis they also select for drug resistant bacteria against which those drugs are then ineffective. Global surveillance has shown that drug resistant Tuberculosis is widespread and is now a threat to tuberculosis control programs in many countries. Application of molecular methods during the last decade has greatly changed our understanding of drug resistance in tuberculosis. Application of molecular epidemiological methods was also central to the description of outbreaks of drug resistance in Tuberculosis. This review describes recommendations for Tuberculosis treatment according to the WHO guidelines, the drug resistance problem in the world, mechanisms of resistance to first line and second line drugs and applications of molecular methods to detect resistance causing gene mutations. It is envisaged that molecular techniques may be important adjuncts to traditional culture based procedures to rapidly screen for drug resistance. Prospective analysis and intervention to prevent transmission may be particularly helpful in areas with ongoing transmission of drug resistant strains as recent mathematical modeling indicate that the burden of MDR-TB cannot be contained in the absence of specific efforts to limit transmission.},

  abstract    = {Kenya is heralded as an example of declining HIV in Africa, while its tuberculosis (TB) numbers continue rising. We conducted a comparative investigation of TB-HIV co-dynamics in Africa to determine the likelihood of reported trends.Our mathematical modeling analysis exposes the notable incongruence of reported trends in Kenya because TB-HIV co-dynamics, tightly knit worldwide and most dramatically in sub-Saharan Africa, suggest that declining HIV trends should trigger reductions in TB trends. Moreover, a continental-scale analysis of TB-HIV trends places Kenya as an outlier in eastern and southern Africa, and shows TB outpacing HIV in western central Africa. We further investigate which TB processes across HIV stages have greater potential to reduce TB incidence via a sensitivity analysis.There are two parsimonious explanations: an unaccounted improvement in TB case detection has occurred, or HIV is not declining as reported. The TB-HIV mismatch could be compounded by surveillance biases due to spatial heterogeneity in disease dynamics. Results highlight the need to re-evaluate trends of both diseases in Kenya, and identify the most critical epidemiological factors at play. Substantial demographic changes have occurred in Kenya, including rapid urbanization accompanied by poor living conditions, which could disproportionately increase TB incidence. Other possible contributors include immune reconstitution due to the recent delivery of antiretrovirals, and an increased presence of the virulent Beijing/W TB genotype. Results support the importance of integrating information from closely interacting epidemics, because this approach provides critical insights unobtainable when components of generalized epidemics are considered individually.},

Utilizing in vivo drug-clearance profiles from animal and/or human studies and simulating them in an in vitro PK/PD model allows the in-depth characterization of antibiotic activity of new and existing antibacterials by generating time–kill data. These data capture the dynamic interplay between mycobacterial growth and changing drug concentration as encountered during prolonged drug therapy. This review focuses on important PK/PD parameters relevant to anti-TB drug development, provides an overview of in vitro PK/PD models used to evaluate the efficacy of agents against mycobacteria and discusses the related mathematical modeling approaches of time–kill data. Overall, it provides an introduction to in vitro PK/PD models and their application as critical tools in evaluating anti-TB drugs.},

Deposition patterns within the two morphologies are compared. For the light and heavy respiratory-activity levels considered, regional TB and P, and total (TB + P) lung deposition fractions are calculated. For all particle sizes (0.2-9.0 microns diameters) tested, total deposition in both morphologies was minimal for the 30-y-old adult and maximal for either of the youngest subjects (7 and 22 mo old). A breakdown of total deposition into lung compartments was specifically addressed for one morphological model.

The outbreak occurred after the identified index patient visited a flat on a middle floor in Block E of the Amoy Gardens estate on two nights. Approximately 45\% of the subsequently infected people resided in Block E, while the other 55\% of infected cases mainly resided in six other blocks close to Block E. The distribution of the infected flats in Block E conformed to a non-uniform spatial pattern. Probable environmental causes for airborne transmission associated with the air movements between flats in Block E are identified. The well-established multi-zone airflow modeling method was used to analyze the virus-laden bio-aerosol dispersion between flats through door and window leakage areas in Block E under six different scenarios. The distribution of infection risk in Block E matched with the virus concentrations in flats predicted with the use of multi-zone modeling. Our study shows the importance of ventilation design in high-rise residential apartments.The present study on the Amoy Gardens outbreak presented a scenario in which crowded living spaces might lead to infection disasters. There is a need to improve the current sanitary drainage design and maintenance standards to avoid any leakage of foul gas into the indoor environments. Our study revealed the need for a review of indoor air quality and ventilation design in buildings including offices, homes and hotels. The study has implications to public health in, for example, the control of other airborne respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza, and in bio-terror safety in buildings.},

The highest particle concentrations were observed at the head of the bed nearest to the air return vent, and the lowest concentrations were observed at the foot of the bed.Mathematical modeling provides clinically relevant data on the potential exposure risk in patient care rooms and is applicable in multiple healthcare delivery settings.

Here, we summarize evidence linking social, economic and biologic determinants to tuberculosis (TB) and review modeling approaches that have been used to understand their contribution to the epidemic dynamics of TB. Specifically, we find evidence for associations between smoking, indoor air pollution, diabetes mellitus, alcohol, nutritional status, crowding, migration, aging and economic trends, and the occurrence of TB infection and/or disease. We outline some methodological problems inherent to the study of these associations; these include study design issues, reverse causality and misclassification of both exposure and outcomes. We then go on to review two existing approaches to modeling the impact of determinants and the effect of interventions: the population attributable fraction model, which estimates the proportion of the TB burden that would be averted if exposure to a risk factor were eliminated from the population, and deterministic epidemic models that capture transmission dynamics and the indirect effects of interventions. We conclude by defining research priorities in both the study of specific determinants and the development of appropriate models to assess the impact of addressing these determinants.},

Adherence and successful completion of the treatment are equally important. Unfortunately, due to a number of personal, psychosocial, economic, medical, and health service factors, a significant number of TB patients become irregular and default from treatment. In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to assess the impact of early therapy for latent TB and non-adherence on controlling TB transmission dynamics. Equilibrium states of the model are determined and their local stability is examined. With the aid of the center manifold theory, it is established that the model undergoes a backward bifurcation. Qualitative mathematical analysis of the model suggests that a high level of latent tuberculosis case findings, coupled with a decrease of defaulting rate, may be effective in controlling TB transmission dynamics in the community. Population-level effects of organized campaigns to improve early therapy and to guarantee successful completion of each treatment are evaluated through numerical simulations and presented in support of the analytical results.},

Thus, it is important to ensure that micro-CT can differentiate healthy and pathological bone. This study aimed to determine whether the reproducibility of bone histomorphometry and micro-CT, and agreement between the techniques, vary in bone samples with different metabolic status. Iliac crest biopsies (n = 36) were obtained from healthy subjects (n = 10) and from patients with osteoporosis (OP) (n = 15) or renal osteodystrophy (ROD) (n = 11). Micro-CT and histomorphometry analyses were repeated twice. Results were analyzed in separate groups and after pooling the data. Bone histomorphometry detected generally known differences between the diseases, whereas micro-CT did not detect differences between normal and ROD samples as effectively. Repeated measurements for BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N, and Tb.Sp exhibited linear correlation coefficients (ρ) of 0.87-0.92 [coefficients of variations (CV), 8.3-27.2\%] for histomorphometry and of 0.66-0.94 (CV, 4.4-23.4\%) for micro-CT. There were no significant differences in reproducibility among samples from different study groups. Correlations between BV/TV (micro-CT) and mineralized bone volume (Md.V/TV, histomorphometry) were weaker than between BV/TV (micro-CT) and BV/TV (histomorphometry). When comparing the techniques, BV/TV, Tb.Th, and Tb.N displayed moderate correlations (ρ = 0.39-0.62, P < 0.05), and the agreement for BV/TV was highest in OP samples. The agreement between the techniques using clinical bone samples was moderate. Especially, micro-CT was less effective than bone histomorphometry in differentiating ROD from normal samples. The reproducibility was not affected by the health status of bone. Histomorphometry is still needed in clinical practice to study the remodeling balance in bone, and the methods are complementary.},

  abstract    = {The study objective was to analyze the three-dimensional (3D) trabecular architecture and mechanical properties in vertebral specimens of young and mature Sinclair minipigs to assess the relative contribution of architecture to bone strength. We used 3D magnetic resonance microimaging (MRmicroI) and direct image analysis to evaluate a set of standard structural measurements and new architectural descriptors of trabecular bone in biopsy specimens from L2, L3, and L4 vertebrae (n = 16 in each group) from young (mean age, 1.2 years) and mature (mean age, 4.8 years) minipigs. The measurements included bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), marrow star volume (Ma.St.V), connectivity density (ConnD), and two new parameters, percent platelike trabeculae (\% plate) and percent bone in the load direction (\% boneLD). The \% plate, calculated from surface curvature, allowed the delineation of plates from rods. The \% boneLD quantified the percentage of bone oriented along the long axis of the vertebral body. We showed that 3D MRmicroI can detect the subtle changes in trabecular architecture between the two age groups. ConnD, star volume, \% plate, \% boneLD, and BV/TV were found to be more effective than the model-based, derived indices (trabecular thickness [Tb.Th], trabecular separation [Tb.Sp], and trabecular number [Tb.N]) in differentiating the structural changes. BV/TV, \% plate, and \% boneLD significantly increased (p < 0.05) in all three vertebral sites of the mature minipigs. The significant decrease in ConnD and star volume in the mature vertebra was consistent with the concurrent increase of platelike trabecular bone (p < 0.05). Overall, ConnD, star volume, \% plate, and \% boneLD provided a coherent picture of the architectural changes between the two age groups. Apparent modulus and maximum stress were determined experimentally on biopsy specimens from L2 vertebrae (n = 16). When apparent modulus was predicted using 3D MRmicroI data sets as input for finite element modeling (FEM), the results were similar to the experimentally determined apparent modulus (p = 0.12). Both methods were then used to compare the young and the mature animals; the experimental and predicted apparent modulus were significantly higher for the mature group (p = 0.003 and 0.012, respectively). The experimental maximum stress in the vertebra of the mature animals was twice as high as that for the young animals (p = 0.006). Bone quantity (BV/TV or bone mineral content [BMC]) alone could explain approximately 74-85\% of the total variability in stress and modulus. The inclusion of either ConnD or \% boneLD with BV/TV in a multiple regression analysis significantly improved the predictability of maximum stress, indicating that architecture makes additional contributions to compressive strength in normal minipig vertebra.},

  abstract    = {The distribution of trabecular structures in mammalian long bone metaphyses has been insufficiently explored. We show in rats that the trabecular bone structural parameters display a decreasing gradient, toward the diaphysis, that can be defined mathematically. This gradient is applicable for optimizing the reference volume in metabolic studies and for retrospective correction of implant positioning.The mammalian metaphyseal trabecular bone is unevenly distributed. Hence, defining a standard reference volume is critical for morphometric analyses in metaphyseal sites.The distal femoral and proximal tibial metaphyses of adult orchietomized (ORX) or sham-ORX rats were scanned by microCT 6 wk postoperatively. Morphometric analysis based on 3D image data was performed in 450-microm-thick transversal segments defined consecutively from the primary spongiosa toward the diaphysis. The results were subjected to curve-fit analysis. A similar approach was used for proximal tibial metaphyseal sites carrying titanium implants inserted horizontally 6 wk post-ORX and examined 2-12 wk after implantation.The respective curve-fit analysis in both femur and tibia revealed decreasing linear/quadratic and logarithmic gradients for all morphometric parameters in the sham-ORX animals. The ORX animals showed similar gradients with roughly similar slopes but lower values. For the bone volume (BV/TV) and connectivity (Conn.D) densities, the magnitude of the ORX effect vastly increased toward the diaphysis. The trabecular number was unaffected in ORX femora and tibias. The trabecular thickness showed a constant decrease in the femur and was unchanged in the tibia. These findings are useful for the determination and reporting of reference volumes in morphometric studies. Implementing the curve-fit analysis for retrospective correction of implant positioning revealed differences in BV/TV, Tb.N, Conn.D, and percent implant surface in contact with bone (\%OI) between the sham-ORX and ORX rats. These differences were otherwise undisclosed. In addition, a temporal increase in \%OI was shown only for the corrected measurements.We show the feasibility of modeling trabecular bone structures using mathematical tools. Such modeling may be used as an experimental tool. Moreover, if proven applicable to human skeletal structures, it may be further developed for the diagnosis of metabolic bone diseases and evaluation of therapeutic measures.},

  abstract    = {To optimize and predict the release of proteins from biodegradable microspheres based on crosslinked dextran, a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms controlling their release is necessary. For that purpose, a mathematical model has been developed to describe the release of proteins from these hydrogel-based microspheres. A kinetic Monte Carlo scheme for the degradation of a small domain inside the microsphere was developed. The results from this were used in a second kinetic Monte Carlo scheme to model the diffusion and the subsequent release of proteins. The only processes included in this model are diffusion and degradation. The general effects of diffusion, crosslink density, protein loading, and clustering of proteins on the release were investigated. The model crosslink density (Xmodel) and the model diffusivity (Dmodel) were fitted to experimental release data of BSA monomer from hydroxyethyl methacrylated dextran (dex-HEMA) microspheres. By using the experimental release curves of liposomes and BSA monomer, it was found that (1) the model crosslink density (Xmodel) scales with the hydrodynamic diameter (dh) as dh(1.64) and (2) the diffusivity of the protein (Dmodel) scales approximately with 1/dh (Stokes-Einstein). Using these scaling relations, quantitative predictions of the release curves of BSA dimer, immunoglobulin G and human growth hormone were possible. In conclusion, this model may play an important role in the optimization, understanding and prediction of the release of various proteins from degradable hydrogels.},

In this study, a source (i.e. a patient who generates droplets) and a receiver (i.e. a susceptible object other than the source) are modeled in a mechanically ventilated room. The receiver's exposure to the droplet nuclei is analyzed under two orientations relative to the source. Two droplet nuclei, 0.1 and 10 microm, with different emission velocities, are selected to represent large expiratory droplets which can still be inhaled into the human respiratory tracts. The droplet dispersion and mixing characteristics under well-mixed and displacement ventilation schemes are evaluated and compared numerically. Results show that the droplet dispersion and mixing under displacement ventilation is consistently poorer. Very low concentration regions are also observed in the displacement scheme. For both ventilation schemes, the intake dose will be reduced substantially if the droplets are emitted under the face-to-wall orientation rather than the face-to-face orientation. Implications of using engineering strategies for reducing exposure are briefly discussed.},

To optimize moxifloxacin dose and dose regimen, pharmacodynamic antibiotic-exposure targets associated with maximal microbial kill and complete suppression of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis must be identified.We used a novel in vitro pharmacodynamic infection model of tuberculosis in which we exposed M. tuberculosis to moxifloxacin with a pharmacokinetic half-life of decline similar to that encountered in humans. Data obtained from this model were mathematically modeled, and the drug-exposure breakpoint associated with the suppression of drug resistance was determined. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to determine the probability that 10,000 clinical patients taking different doses of moxifloxacin would achieve or exceed the drug-exposure breakpoint needed to suppress resistance to moxifloxacin in M. tuberculosis.The ratio of the moxifloxacin-free (non-protein-bound) area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h to the minimum inhibitory concentration associated with complete suppression of the drug-resistant mutant population was 53. For patients taking moxifloxacin doses of 400, 600, or 800 mg/day, the calculated target-attainment rates to suppress drug resistance were 59\%, 86\%, and 93\%, respectively.A moxifloxacin dose of 800 mg/day is likely to achieve excellent M. tuberculosis microbial kill and to suppress drug resistance. However, tolerability of this higher dose is still unknown.},

Contact examinations are basically done for contacts of sputum smear positive TB cases, but infection may occur at fiberbronchoscopy of sputum smear negative TB cases and at the time of irrigation of TB abscess. Therefore, contact examination requires bigger target group than usual contact examinations. Mathematical model analysis of cost effectiveness examination showed that contact examinations at the age of 20s to 40s will be cost saving if it is done for the contacts with the risk of infection of 6\% and beneficial for the DALY lost due to TB infection if it is done for the contacts with the risk of infection of 3\%. Addition of baseline QFT for the HCWs at the age of 20s requires 100 million yen for the recovery of 1 DALY lost due to hospital acquired TB infection. Also mathematical modeling showed that periodical QFT testing of HCWs at the age of 20s to 40s will be beneficial for the DALY lost due to TB infection if the annual risk of infection will be around 2\% and will be cost saving if the annual risk of infection will be around 8\%. Therefore, periodical QFT is recommended for the staff working at the environment with high risk of infection (around 2\% per year).},

  abstract    = {Despite numerous intervention strategies, including the direct observed short-course treatment strategy and improved diagnostic methods, the incidence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) continues to rise globally. Many treatment policies are based on the model that acquisition of drug resistance in already infected individuals drives the drug-resistant TB epidemic, hence the focus on drug-resistance testing of retreatment cases. However, molecular epidemiology and mathematical modeling suggest that the majority of multidrug-resistant TB cases are due to ongoing transmission of multidrug-resistant strains. This is most likely the result of diagnostic delay, thereby emphasizing the need for rapid diagnostics and comprehensive contact tracing, as well as active case finding. Current diagnosis of TB in low-income, high-burden regions relies on smear microscopy and clinical signs and symptoms. However, this smear-centered approach has many pitfalls, including low sensitivity in HIV patients and children, the inability of smear to reveal drug-resistance patterns, and the need for sampling on consecutive days. In order to address these limitations, efforts have been made to expand access to Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture and drug susceptibility testing. However, the slow growth rate of the causative agent, M. tuberculosis, contributes to significant diagnostic delay. Molecular-based diagnostic methods, targeting mutations that are known to confirm drug resistance, are capable of significantly reducing diagnostic delay. Two such methods, the line-probe assay and the real-time PCR-based Xpert® MTB/RIF assay, have been described. The latter test shows particular promise for smear-negative and extrapulmonary specimens. This may prove especially useful in settings where co-infection rates with HIV are high. However, since most research focuses on the performance of both of these assays, further investigations need to be done regarding the impact of the routine implementation of these assays on TB control programs and the cost effectiveness thereof.},

  abstract    = {The number of cases of paralytic poliomyelitis has declined in Nigeria since the introduction of newly licensed monovalent oral poliovirus vaccines and new techniques of vaccine delivery. Understanding the relative contribution of these vaccines and the improved coverage to the decline in incident cases is essential for future planning.We estimated the field efficacies of monovalent type 1 oral poliovirus vaccine and trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine, using the reported number of doses received by people with poliomyelitis and by matched controls as identified in Nigeria's national surveillance database, in which 27,379 cases of acute flaccid paralysis were recorded between 2001 and 2007. Our estimates of vaccine coverage and vaccine-induced immunity were based on the number of doses received by children listed in the database who had paralysis that was not caused by poliovirus.The estimated efficacies per dose of monovalent type 1 oral poliovirus vaccine and trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine against type 1 paralytic poliomyelitis were 67\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 39 to 82) and 16\% (95\% CI, 10 to 21), respectively, and the estimated efficacy per dose of trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine against type 3 paralytic poliomyelitis was 18\% (95\% CI, 9 to 26). In the northwestern region of Nigeria, which reported the majority of cases during the study period, coverage with at least one dose of vaccine increased from 59 to 78\%. Between 2005 and 2007, vaccine-induced immunity levels among children under the age of 5 years more than doubled, to 56\%.The higher efficacy of monovalent type 1 oral poliovirus vaccine (four times as effective as trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine) and the moderate gains in coverage dramatically increased vaccine-induced immunity against serotype 1 in northern Nigeria. Further increases in coverage in Nigerian states with infected populations are required to achieve the levels of vaccine-induced immunity associated with the sustained elimination achieved in other parts of the country.},

We analyzed the temporal and spatial distributions of cases in a large community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and examined the correlation of these data with the three-dimensional spread of a virus-laden aerosol plume that was modeled using studies of airflow dynamics.We determined the distribution of the initial 187 cases of SARS in the Amoy Gardens housing complex in 2003 according to the date of onset and location of residence. We then studied the association between the location (building, floor, and direction the apartment unit faced) and the probability of infection using logistic regression. The spread of the airborne, virus-laden aerosols generated by the index patient was modeled with the use of airflow-dynamics studies, including studies performed with the use of computational fluid-dynamics and multizone modeling.The curves of the epidemic suggested a common source of the outbreak. All but 5 patients lived in seven buildings (A to G), and the index patient and more than half the other patients with SARS (99 patients) lived in building E. Residents of the floors at the middle and upper levels in building E were at a significantly higher risk than residents on lower floors; this finding is consistent with a rising plume of contaminated warm air in the air shaft generated from a middle-level apartment unit. The risks for the different units matched the virus concentrations predicted with the use of multizone modeling. The distribution of risk in buildings B, C, and D corresponded well with the three-dimensional spread of virus-laden aerosols predicted with the use of computational fluid-dynamics modeling.Airborne spread of the virus appears to explain this large community outbreak of SARS, and future efforts at prevention and control must take into consideration the potential for airborne spread of this virus.},

  abstract    = {Incidence and mortality due to tuberculosis (TB) have been decreasing worldwide. Given that TB is a cosmopolitan disease, proper surveillance and evaluation are critical for controlling dissemination. Herein, mathematical modeling was performed in order to: 1) demonstrate a correlation between the incidence of TB in HIV-free patients in the US and Germany, and their corresponding mortality rates; 2) show the utility of the newly developed D-R algorithm for analyzing and predicting the incidence of TB in both countries; and 3) inform us on population death rates due to TB in HIV-negative patients. Using data published by the World Health Organization between 1990 and 2009, the relationship between incidence and mortality that could not be ascribed to HIV infection was evaluated. Using linear, quadratic and cubic curves, we found that a cubic function provided the best fit with the data in both the US (Y = 2.3588+2.2459X+61.1639X(2)-60.104X(3)) and Germany (Y = 1.9271+9.4967X+18.3824X(2)-10.350X(3)) where the correlation coefficient (R) between incidence and mortality was 0.995 and 0.993, respectively. Second, we demonstrated that fitted curves using the D-R model were equal to or better than those generated using the GM(1,1) algorithm as exemplified in the relative values for Sum of Squares of Error, Relative Standard Error, Mean Absolute Deviation, Average Relative Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. Finally, future trends using both the D-R and the classic GM(1,1) models predicted a continued decline in infection and mortality rates of TB in HIV-negative patients rates extending to 2015 assuming no changes to diagnosis or treatment regimens are enacted.},

  abstract    = {While bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination plays an important role in reducing the morbidity of tuberculosis (TB) infection during childhood, new tuberculosis vaccines are necessary to disrupt the transmission of disease and improve global control of this pathogen. Growing evidence of the presence of meaningful Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain diversity, coupled with the possibility that new vaccines may differentially protect against infection or disease with circulating M. tuberculosis strains, suggest that these vaccines may have complicated effects on disease dynamics. We use a mathematical model to explore the potential effects of strain diversity on the performance of vaccines and find that vaccines offer great promise for improving tuberculosis control, but the expected benefits of mass vaccination will be eroded if strain replacement with M. tuberculosis variants that are not effectively targeted by vaccines occurs. Determining the likelihood of strain replacement will require additional knowledge of the strain specificities of current vaccine candidates, and an improved understanding of the mechanisms of strain interaction, which are responsible for maintaining the diversity of M. tuberculosis within communities.},

TB kills two million people each year and foci of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) have been identified in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A critical question for health policy is whether standardized short-course chemotherapy for TB, based on cheap first-line drugs, can prevent and reverse the spread of drug resistance. Here we use mathematical modeling, in conjunction with treatment results from six countries, to show that best-practice short-course chemotherapy is highly likely to bring strains resistant to either of the two key drugs isoniazid and rifampicin under control and to prevent the emergence of MDR-TB. However, it is not certain to contain MDR-TB once it has emerged, partly because cure rates are too low. We estimate that approximately 70\% of prevalent, infectious MDR-TB cases should be detected and treated each year, and at least 80\% of these cases should be cured, in order to prevent outbreaks of MDR-TB. Poor control programs should aim to increase case detection and cure rates together for three reasons: (i) these variables act synergistically; (ii) when either is low, the other cannot succeed alone; and (iii) the second-line drugs needed to raise MDR-TB cure rates are few and extremely costly. We discuss the implications of these results for World Health Organization policy on the management of antibiotic resistance.},

  abstract    = {The purpose of this article is to quantify the public health risk associated with inhalation of indoor airborne infection based on a probabilistic transmission dynamic modeling approach. We used the Wells-Riley mathematical model to estimate (1) the CO2 exposure concentrations in indoor environments where cases of inhalation airborne infection occurred based on reported epidemiological data and epidemic curves for influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), (2) the basic reproductive number, R0 (i.e., expected number of secondary cases on the introduction of a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population) and its variability in a shared indoor airspace, and (3) the risk for infection in various scenarios of exposure in a susceptible population for a range of R0. We also employ a standard susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) structure to relate Wells-Riley model derived R0 to a transmission parameter to implicate the relationships between indoor carbon dioxide concentration and contact rate. We estimate that a single case of SARS will infect 2.6 secondary cases on average in a population from nosocomial transmission, whereas less than 1 secondary infection was generated per case among school children. We also obtained an estimate of the basic reproductive number for influenza in a commercial airliner: the median value is 10.4. We suggest that improving the building air cleaning rate to lower the critical rebreathed fraction of indoor air can decrease transmission rate. Here, we show that virulence of the organism factors, infectious quantum generation rates (quanta/s by an infected person), and host factors determine the risk for inhalation of indoor airborne infection.},

Obtaining and maintaining these benefits requires that policymakers manage the transition from the current massive use of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) to a world without OPV and free of the risks of potential future reintroductions of live polioviruses. This article describes the analytical journey that began in 2001 with a retrospective case study on polio risk management and led to development of dynamic integrated risk, economic, and decision analysis tools to inform global policies for managing the risks of polio. This analytical journey has provided several key insights and lessons learned that will be useful to future analysts involved in similar complex decision-making processes.},

We suggest the need for a complementary and different conceptual approach to achieve eradication compared to the current case-based approach using surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) to identify symptomatic poliovirus infections. Specifically, we describe a modeling approach to characterize overall population immunity to poliovirus transmission. The approach deals with the realities that exposure to live polioviruses (e.g., WPV, OPV) and/or vaccination with inactivated poliovirus vaccine provides protection from paralytic polio (i.e., disease), but does not eliminate the potential for reinfection or asymptomatic participation in poliovirus transmission, which may increase with time because of waning immunity. The AFP surveillance system provides evidence of symptomatic poliovirus infections detected, which indicate immunity gaps after outbreaks occur, and this system represents an appropriate focus for controlling disease outbreaks. We describe a conceptual dynamic model to characterize population immunity to poliovirus transmission that helps identify risks created by immunity gaps before outbreaks occur, which provides an opportunity for national and global policymakers to manage the risk of poliovirus and prevent outbreaks before they occur. We suggest that dynamically modeling risk represents an essential tool as the number of cases approaches zero.},

We estimate a median patient delay of 83 d and a mean treatment delay of 2.3 d. Of 14 cases suspected for multiresistance and microbiologically assayed, 5 were found to carry a multi-drug-resistant strain. We also found a significant association between a short patient delay and the presence of hemoptysis (p = 0.002) or dyspnea (p<0.001). 86 patients (46.8\%) were sputum smear microscopy negative at the end of treatment and 40 (21.7\%) completed treatment giving an overall success rate of 68.5\%, which compares unfavorably with the World Health Organization target success rate of 85\%.

Studies focused on strategies to contain local outbreaks after their detection show that timely interventions with vaccination and contact tracing are able to halt transmission. However, such studies do not consider the effects of human mobility patterns. Using a large-scale structured metapopulation model to simulate the global spread of smallpox after an intentional release event, we show that index cases and potential outbreaks can occur in different continents even before the detection of the pathogen release. These results have two major implications: i) intentional release of a highly pathogenic agent within a country will have global effects; ii) the release event may trigger outbreaks in countries lacking the health infrastructure necessary for effective containment. The presented study provides data with potential uses in defining contingency plans at the National and International level.},

Data were obtained from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance Report (506), Ministry of Public Health. The joint effects of gender, age, quarterly season and location on the TB incidence rates were modeled using both negative binomial distribution for the number of cases and log-linear distribution for the incidence rate; then these models were compared. The linear regression models provided a good fit, as indicated by residual plots and the R2 (0.64). The model showed that males and females aged less than 25 years had similar risks for TB in the study area. Both sexes had their risk increased with age but to a much greater extent for men than women, with the highest rate noted in males aged 65 years and over. There was no evidence of a trend in the annual incidence of TB during 1999-2004, but the incidence has a significant season variation with peaks in the first quarter over the six year period. There were also differences in the incidence rate of TB both within and between provinces. The high risk areas were in upper western and lower southern parts of the region. The log-linear regression model could be used as a simple method for modeling TB incidence rates. These findings highlight the importance of selectively monitoring geographic location when studying TB incidence patterns.},

Under the special case where the new members of immigration are all susceptible, the model considered here shows a threshold phenomenon and a sharp threshold has been obtained.

Gaining a greater understanding of TB transmission dynamics requires further empirical laboratory and field work, mathematical modelling and interaction between them. Modelling can be used to quantify uncertainty due to different gaps in our knowledge to help identify research priorities. Fortunately, the present moment is an exciting time for TB epidemiology, with rapid progress being made in applying new mathematical modelling techniques, new tools for TB diagnosis and genetic analysis and a growing interest in developing more-effective public-health interventions.},

  abstract    = {Although many infections that are transmissible from person to person are acquired through direct contact between individuals, a minority, notably pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), measles and influenza are known to be spread by the airborne route. Airborne infections pose a particular threat to susceptible individuals whenever they are placed together with the index case in confined spaces. With this in mind, waiting areas of healthcare facilities present a particular challenge, since large numbers of people, some of whom may have underlying conditions which predispose them to infection, congregate in such spaces and can be exposed to an individual who may be shedding potentially pathogenic microorganisms. It is therefore important to understand the risks posed by infectious individuals in waiting areas, so that interventions can be developed to minimise the spread of airborne infections.A stochastic Monte Carlo model was constructed to analyse the transmission of airborne infection in a hypothetical 132 m3 hospital waiting area in which occupancy levels, waiting times and ventilation rate can all be varied. In the model the Gammaitoni-Nucci equation was utilized to predict probability of susceptible individuals becoming infected. The model was used to assess the risk of transmission of three infectious diseases, TB, influenza and measles. In order to allow for stochasticity a random number generator was applied to the variables in the model and a total of 10000 individual simulations were undertaken. The mean quanta production rates used in the study were 12.7, 100 and 570 per hour for TB, influenza and measles, respectively.The results of the study revealed the mean probability of acquiring a TB infection during a 30-minute stay in the waiting area to be negligible (i.e. 0.0034), while that for influenza was an order of magnitude higher at 0.0262. By comparison the mean probability of acquiring a measles infection during the same period was 0.1349. If the duration of the stay was increased to 60 minutes then these values increased to 0.0087, 0.0662 and 0.3094, respectively.Under normal circumstances the risk of acquiring a TB infection during a visit to a hospital waiting area is minimal. Likewise the risks associated with the transmission of influenza, although an order of magnitude greater than those for TB, are relatively small. By comparison, the risks associated with measles are high. While the installation of air disinfection may be beneficial, when seeking to prevent the transmission of airborne viral infection it is important to first minimize waiting times and the number of susceptible individuals present before turning to expensive technological solutions.},

  abstract    = {Geographical and temporal diffusion patterns of a human pandemic due to Swine Origin Influenza Virus (S-OIV) remain uncertain. The extent to which national and international pandemic preparedness plans and control strategies can slow or stop the process is not known. However, despite preparedness efforts, it appears that, particularly in the USA, Mexico, Canada and the UK, local chains of virus transmission can sustain autonomous dynamics which may lead to the next pandemic. Forecasts of influenza experts usually rely on information related to new circulating strains.We attempted to quantify the possible spread of the pandemic across a network of 52 major cities and to predict the effect of vaccination against the pandemic strain, if available. Predictions are based on simulations from a stochastic SEIR model. Parameters used in the simulations are set to values consistent with recent estimations from the outbreak in Mexico.We show that a two-wave pandemic dynamic may be observed in Southern hemisphere because of seasonal constraints for a maximum value of the basic reproductive number (R0, max) within a city equal to 1.5 and a mean generation interval (GI) of 2 days. In this case and in the absence of vaccination, attack rates may reach 46\% when considering a completely susceptible population. More severe scenarios characterized by higher values of R0, max (2.2) and GI (3.1) yield an attack rate of 77\%. By extrapolation, we find that mass vaccination in all countries (i.e. up to 50\% of the population) implemented 6 months after the start of the pandemic may reduce the cumulative number of cases by 91\% in the case of the low transmissible strain (R0, max = 1.5). This relative reduction is only 44\% for R0, max = 2.2 since most of the cases occur in the first 6 months and so before the vaccination campaign.Although uncertainties remain about the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the new influenza strain, this study provides the first analysis of the potential spread of the pandemic and first assessment of the impact of different immunization strategies.},

  abstract    = {The HIV epidemic has caused a dramatic increase in tuberculosis (TB) in East and southern Africa. Several strategies have the potential to reduce the burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings, and cost and cost-effectiveness analyses can help to prioritize them when budget constraints exist. However, published cost and cost-effectiveness studies are limited.Our objective was to compare the cost, affordability and cost-effectiveness of seven strategies for reducing the burden of TB in countries with high HIV prevalence. A compartmental difference equation model of TB and HIV and recent cost data were used to assess the costs (year 2003 USD prices) and effects (TB cases averted, deaths averted, DALYs gained) of these strategies in Kenya during the period 2004-2023.The three lowest cost and most cost-effective strategies were improving TB cure rates, improving TB case detection rates, and improving both together. The incremental cost of combined improvements to case detection and cure was below USD 15 million per year (7.5\% of year 2000 government health expenditure); the mean cost per DALY gained of these three strategies ranged from USD 18 to USD 34. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) had the highest incremental costs, which by 2007 could be as large as total government health expenditures in year 2000. ART could also gain more DALYs than the other strategies, at a cost per DALY gained of around USD 260 to USD 530. Both the costs and effects of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (TLTI) for HIV+ individuals were low; the cost per DALY gained ranged from about USD 85 to USD 370. Averting one HIV infection for less than USD 250 would be as cost-effective as improving TB case detection and cure rates to WHO target levels.To reduce the burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings, the immediate goal should be to increase TB case detection rates and, to the extent possible, improve TB cure rates, preferably in combination. Realising the full potential of ART will require substantial new funding and strengthening of health system capacity so that increased funding can be used effectively.},

  abstract    = {In April 2009, a new strain of H1N1 influenza virus, referred to as pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was first detected in humans in the United States, followed by an outbreak in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Soon afterwards, this new virus kept spreading worldwide resulting in a global outbreak. In China, the second Circular of the Ministry of Health pointed out that as of December 31, 2009, the country's 31 provinces had reported 120,000 confirmed cases of H1N1.We formulate an epidemic model of influenza A based on networks. We calculate the basic reproduction number and study the effects of various immunization schemes. The final size relation is derived for the network epidemic model. The model parameters are estimated via least-squares fitting of the model solution to the observed data in China.For the network model, we prove that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction is less than one. The final size will depend on the vaccination starting time, T, the number of infective cases at time T and immunization schemes to follow. Our theoretical results are confirmed by numerical simulations. Using the parameter estimates based on the observation data of the cumulative number of hospital notifications, we estimate the basic reproduction number R0 to be 1.6809 in China.Network modelling supplies a useful tool for studying the transmission of H1N1 in China, capturing the main features of the spread of H1N1. While a uniform, mass-immunization strategy helps control the prevalence, a targeted immunization strategy focusing on specific groups with given connectivity may better control the endemic.},

  abstract    = {For tuberculosis and number of other bacterial infections, treatment with a single antimicrobial drug frequently fails due to the ascent of mutants resistant to that drug. To minimize the likelihood of this occurrence, multiple drugs with independent resistance mechanisms are used simultaneously. None the less, multiply resistant bacteria sometimes emerge even when patients are simultaneously treated with two or more drugs, and the ascent of these multiply-resistant mutants may result in treatment failure in the patient and spread of these resistant bacteria to other hosts. We consider two mathematical models of antibacterial chemotherapy which can account for the ascent of multiple antibiotic resistance within hosts treated with multiple antibiotics. In both, multiple resistance evolves because of selection favouring mutants resistant to fewer than all of the chemotherapeutic agents employed, intermediates. In one model, this occurs because of temporal fluctuations in the concentrations of the antibiotics in the course of normal treatment and/or because of non-adherence to the treatment regime. In the other, intermediates are favoured and multiple resistance evolves because of tissue and somatic cell heterogeneity. In the effective concentrations of the antibiotics and physiological variation in the sensitivity of subpopulations of bacteria to different antibiotics. We discuss the limitations (and assets) of this model and approach and the implications for the design of antibiotic treatment regimes. Finally, we consider how the assumptions behind this model and the predictions made from its analysis could be tested experimentally.},

The purpose of this study is to quantify public health risk related to the inhalation of airborne infectious agents in public vehicles during transportation based on a mathematical model.The reproduction number for the influenza infection in a train (R(A)) was estimated using a model based on the Wells-Riley model. To estimate the influence of environmental parameters, the duration of exposure and the number of passengers were varied. If an infected person will not use a mask and all susceptible people will wear a mask, a reduction in the risk of transmission could be expected.The estimated probability distribution of R(A) had a median of 2.22, and the distribution was fitted to a log-normal distribution with a geometric mean of 2.22 and a geometric standard deviation of 1.53, under the condition that there are 150 passengers, and that 13 ventilation cycles per hour, as required by law, are made. If the exposure time is less than 30 min, the risk may be low. The exposure time can increase the risk linearly. The number of passengers also increases the risk. However, R(A) is fairly insensitive to the number of passengers. Surgical masks are somewhat effective, whereas High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) masks are quite effective. Doubling the rate of ventilation reduces R(A) to almost 1.Because it is not feasible for all passengers to wear a HEPA mask, and improvement in the ventilation seems to be an effective and feasible means of preventing influenza infection in public trains.},

An outbreak of tuberculosis (TB), the routes of which were possibly related to such a facility, has been reported. The purpose of this study was to use a mathematical model to quantify the public health risk of TB infection in such a facility.The reproduction number for airborne infection in an enclosed space (R (A)) was estimated using a Wells-Riley model. First, we estimated R (A) for the TB infection based on the report of the TB outbreak in the Internet café. Second, TB infectious dose, number of days of exposure, and air-exchange rate in the facility were varied to estimate the effect of TB risk settings and environmental factors.We assumed that TB patients and 59 susceptible subjects stayed for 150 days in a room where the air-exchange rate was five per hour. Using the estimated median R (A) of 44.14, the TB infection rate was 74.6\%. This result was similar to the epidemiological report that the TB infection rate among employees in the Internet café was 70\%. The median R (A) increased linearly as the number of days of exposure increased. The slope of the change in median R (A) divided by the change in the number of days of exposure increased exponentially as air-exchange rate decreased; thus air ventilation in a facility may be essential to prevent TB infection.Appropriate air ventilation in facilities such as Internet cafés is needed as part of a TB-control program in metropolitan areas.},

  abstract    = {Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) has emerged as a threat to TB control efforts in several high-burden areas, generating international concern. XDR TB is now found in every region of the world, but appears most worrisome in the context of HIV and in resource-limited settings with congregate hospital wards. Here, we examine the emergence and transmission dynamics of the disease, incorporating the mathematical modelling literature related to airborne infection and epidemiological studies related to the operations of TB control programmes in resource-limited settings. We find that while XDR TB may present many challenges in the setting of resource constraints, the central problems highlighted by the emergence of XDR TB are those that have plagued TB programmes for years. These include a slow rate of case detection that permits prolonged infectiousness, the threat of airborne infection in enclosed spaces, the problem of inadequate treatment delivery and treatment completion, and the need to develop health systems that can address the combination of TB and poverty. Mathematical models of TB transmission shed light on the idea that community-based therapy and rapid detection systems may be beneficial in resource-limited settings, while congregate hospital wards are sites for major structural reform.},

We applied a combination of bioinformatics and mathematical modelling methods to enhance the understanding of TB latency dynamics. Analysis of time course microarray gene expression data was carried out and gene profiles for bacilli adaptation and survival in latency, simulated by hypoxia were determined. Reverse network engineering techniques were used to predict gene dependencies and regulatory interactions. Biochemical systems theory was applied to mathematically model the inferred gene regulatory networks. Significant regulatory genes involved in latency were determined by a combination of systems biology procedures and mathematical modelling of the inferred regulatory networks. Analysis of gene clusters of the inferred networks in the stationary and non-replicating phases of the bacilli predicted probable functions of some of the latency genes to be associated with latency genes of known functions. The systems biology approach and mathematical computational deletion experiments predicted key genes in the TB latency/dormancy program that may be possible TB drug targets. However, these gene candidates require experimental testing and validation.},

This research employs an algorithm that combines an understanding of the interaction between the room airflow and the ultra violet (UV) system. The airflow in such a room is complex and therefore cannot easily be accounted for by existing design guidance. The main findings were firstly, the mean lifetime of the ventilated particles does not reduce in proportion with increasing ventilation rate. Secondly, an increase in the ventilation rate reduces the effectiveness of ultra violet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) with only a limited increase in the number of particles that are ventilated. Finally, there is a social benefit attached to this project from the point of view of helping people who are vulnerable as well as reducing their risk of being exposed to possible tuberculosis infection. The significance of these findings is to provide the engineer and the architect with an essential tool to ensure good design practice. It is also important to ensure that the methodology can be applicable to most isolation room uses.},

Standard short-course chemotherapy (SSCC) can rapidly control illness and dramatically reduce the chance of death, but the impact of treatment has rarely been evaluated in these terms.We developed a mathematical model that makes use of routinely-collected data to calculate the number of deaths directly prevented by TB treatment (i.e. excluding those due to reduced transmission). The method was applied to the world's largest TB control programme covering over 500 million people in 12 provinces of China.Counties which had been enrolled in the programme since 1991 were, by 1997, preventing at least 46\% (37-56\%) of the TB deaths that would otherwise have occurred. If replicated across the entire TB control programme area, this would amount to 30 000 (range 26 000-59 000) deaths directly prevented each year.Short-course chemotherapy has substantially reduced TB mortality in half of China. The analytical method described here could be applied to TB control operations in many other countries, and should help to quantify the true burden of tuberculosis alleviated by SSCC.},

HBV-related deaths among chronically infected persons were determined from HBV-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mortality curves, adjusted for background mortality. The effect of hepatitis B vaccination was calculated from vaccine efficacy and vaccination series coverage, with and without administration of the first dose of vaccine within 24 h of birth (i.e. birth dose) to prevent perinatal HBV infection.For the year 2000, the model estimated 620,000 persons died worldwide from HBV-related causes: 580,000 (94\%) from chronic infection-related cirrhosis and HCC and 40,000 (6\%) from acute hepatitis B. In the surviving birth cohort for the year 2000, the model estimated that without vaccination, 64.8 million would become HBV-infected and 1.4 million would die from HBV-related disease. Infections acquired during the perinatal period, in early childhood (<5 years old), and > or = 5 years of age accounted for 21, 48, and 31\% of deaths, respectively. Routine infant hepatitis B vaccination, with 90\% coverage and the first dose administered at birth would prevent 84\% of global HBV-related deaths.Globally, most HBV-related deaths result from the chronic sequelae of infection acquired in the perinatal and early childhood periods. Inclusion of hepatitis B vaccine into national infant immunization programs could prevent >80\% of HBV-related deaths.},

Model equations, derived by an actuarial method, are developed recursively. Input information required for the calculations includes the age distribution of the study population, pre-HIV annual TB infection rates, annual HIV infection and mortality rates, and estimates of annual TB disease breakdown rates in the absence and in the presence of HIV infection. With correct input data, the model provides a useful blueprint for health agencies in designing effective programmes for curbing the future course of these dual epidemics in the population.},

Because global surveillance for measles is inadequate, a model to quantify country-specific estimates of measles disease burden was formulated to help policy-makers consider control options.Country-specific demographics, developmental status, historic vaccine coverage rates, and age-specific vaccine efficacy and attack rates were used to determine the number of measles cases and deaths for 5-year periods.The model estimates an annual global incidence of 32 million measles-susceptible persons ( approximately 25\% of the global birth cohort), resulting in 28 million cases and 691 thousand deaths. Eighty-four percent (578,000) of the global deaths occur in the World Health Organization African and Southeast Asian regions. Twenty countries account for 82\% of deaths attributable to measles. In nine countries, over 2\% of the birth-cohort are estimated to die from measles.This methodology quantifies country- and age-specific measles disease burden and establishes regional and global disease patterns, allowing aggregations by income groups and regions, which aids policy formulation. The data may be continuously updated, based on dynamic changes in vaccine coverage rates and the incorporation of national vaccination campaigns.},

The threshold is formulated in terms of a basic replacement ratio (disease reproduction number), ?(0), and, equivalently, in terms of the spectral bound of a transmission and travel matrix. Since frequency-dependent (standard) incidence is assumed, the threshold results do not require knowledge of a disease-free equilibrium. As a trade-off, for ?(0)>1, only uniform weak disease persistence is shown in general, while uniform strong persistence is proved for the special case of constant recruitment of susceptibles into the patch populations. For ?(0)<1, Lyapunov's direct stability method shows that small disease outbreaks do not spread much and eventually die out.},

  abstract    = {The eradication of smallpox was achieved by surveillance and containment vaccination after the failure of mass immunization campaigns. The reasons for this failure are considered in this paper. Comparison of population densities in the Indian subcontinent and Africa show that in highly populated areas even an 80\% vaccine coverage will still leave a density of susceptibles high enough to maintain the disease, a finding with important implications for other vaccine campaigns.The final stages in the successful eradication of smallpox worldwide are interpreted in relation to density of susceptibles. The variola virus led to eradication by an aggressive vaccination campaign followed by surveillance and containment of remaining cases because of several characteristics of the disease: it is transmitted by close face-to-face contact; it has no animal reservoir; the infection does no recur; infectivity does not begin until the rash appears. It was estimated that if vaccination could reach 80\% of the population, the disease could be eliminated. This was indeed so in most countries, but not in Nigeria, Bangladesh or India. Data are presented showing that the population density of susceptibles in countries where smallpox disappeared was 1.9 to 3.0/sq km, and the vaccination rates ranged from 80.9\% to 84\%. In 1973, the average density of susceptibles in Bangladesh was 89/sq km, and in India 35, higher than those the total population density at the time in west or central Africa, except for Nigeria and Gambia. After convincing the health authorities to undertake on active search for cases of smallpox, to isolate the patients and to immunize all contacts, Pakistan recorded its last case of smallpox in 1974, India and Bangladesh in 1975. At that time, the density of susceptibles, related to teh overall vaccination coverage, had not changed from that 3 years ago, when smallpox was still out of control. The relevance of this approach for other diseases such as pertussis, poliomyelitis and measles is discussed.},

On the contrary, on a wide range of scale-free networks we observe the absence of an epidemic threshold and its associated critical behavior. This implies that scale-free networks are prone to the spreading and the persistence of infections whatever spreading rate the epidemic agents might possess. These results can help understanding computer virus epidemics and other spreading phenomena on communication and social networks.},

  abstract    = {The recent emergence of hypervirulent subtypes of avian influenza has underlined the potentially devastating effects of pandemic influenza. Were such a virus to acquire the ability to spread efficiently between humans, control would almost certainly be hampered by limited vaccine supplies unless global spread could be substantially delayed. Moreover, the large increases that have occurred in international air travel might be expected to lead to more rapid global dissemination than in previous pandemics.To evaluate the potential of local control measures and travel restrictions to impede global dissemination, we developed stochastic models of the international spread of influenza based on extensions of coupled epidemic transmission models. These models have been shown to be capable of accurately forecasting local and global spread of epidemic and pandemic influenza. We show that under most scenarios restrictions on air travel are likely to be of surprisingly little value in delaying epidemics, unless almost all travel ceases very soon after epidemics are detected.Interventions to reduce local transmission of influenza are likely to be more effective at reducing the rate of global spread and less vulnerable to implementation delays than air travel restrictions. Nevertheless, under the most plausible scenarios, achievable delays are small compared with the time needed to accumulate substantial vaccine stocks.},

  abstract    = {The Xpert MTB/RIF test enables rapid detection of tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance. The World Health Organization recommends Xpert for initial diagnosis in individuals suspected of having multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or HIV-associated TB, and many countries are moving quickly toward adopting Xpert. As roll-out proceeds, it is essential to understand the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies based on Xpert.We evaluated potential health and economic consequences of implementing Xpert in five southern African countries--Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland--where drug resistance and TB-HIV coinfection are prevalent. Using a calibrated, dynamic mathematical model, we compared the status quo diagnostic algorithm, emphasizing sputum smear, against an algorithm incorporating Xpert for initial diagnosis. Results were projected over 10- and 20-y time periods starting from 2012. Compared to status quo, implementation of Xpert would avert 132,000 (95\% CI: 55,000-284,000) TB cases and 182,000 (97,000-302,000) TB deaths in southern Africa over the 10 y following introduction, and would reduce prevalence by 28\% (14\%-40\%) by 2022, with more modest reductions in incidence. Health system costs are projected to increase substantially with Xpert, by US$460 million (294-699 million) over 10 y. Antiretroviral therapy for HIV represents a substantial fraction of these additional costs, because of improved survival in TB/HIV-infected populations through better TB case-finding and treatment. Costs for treating MDR-TB are also expected to rise significantly with Xpert scale-up. Relative to status quo, Xpert has an estimated cost-effectiveness of US$959 (633-1,485) per disability-adjusted life-year averted over 10 y. Across countries, cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from US$792 (482-1,785) in Swaziland to US$1,257 (767-2,276) in Botswana. Assessing outcomes over a 10-y period focuses on the near-term consequences of Xpert adoption, but the cost-effectiveness results are conservative, with cost-effectiveness ratios assessed over a 20-y time horizon approximately 20\% lower than the 10-y values.Introduction of Xpert could substantially change TB morbidity and mortality through improved case-finding and treatment, with more limited impact on long-term transmission dynamics. Despite extant uncertainty about TB natural history and intervention impact in southern Africa, adoption of Xpert evidently offers reasonable value for its cost, based on conventional benchmarks for cost-effectiveness. However, the additional financial burden would be substantial, including significant increases in costs for treating HIV and MDR-TB. Given the fundamental influence of HIV on TB dynamics and intervention costs, care should be taken when interpreting the results of this analysis outside of settings with high HIV prevalence.},

A quantitative understanding of the factors that predict the distribution and timing of outbreaks will enable their prevention and facilitate the completion of global eradication.Children with poliomyelitis in Africa from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2010 were identified through routine surveillance of cases of acute flaccid paralysis, and separate outbreaks associated with importation of wild-type poliovirus were defined using the genetic relatedness of these viruses in the VP1/2A region. Potential explanatory variables were examined for their association with the number, size, and duration of poliomyelitis outbreaks in 6-mo periods using multivariable regression analysis. The predictive ability of 6-mo-ahead forecasts of poliomyelitis outbreaks in each country based on the regression model was assessed. A total of 142 genetically distinct outbreaks of poliomyelitis were recorded in 25 African countries, resulting in 1-228 cases (median of two cases). The estimated number of people arriving from infected countries and <5-y childhood mortality were independently associated with the number of outbreaks. Immunisation coverage based on the reported vaccination history of children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis was associated with the duration and size of each outbreak, as well as the number of outbreaks. Six-month-ahead forecasts of the number of outbreaks in a country or region changed over time and had a predictive ability of 82\%.Outbreaks of poliomyelitis resulted primarily from continued transmission in Nigeria and the poor immunisation status of populations in neighbouring countries. From 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2011, reduced transmission in Nigeria and increased incidence in reinfected countries in west and central Africa have changed the geographical risk of polio outbreaks, and will require careful immunisation planning to limit onward spread.

  abstract    = {Early diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection and suppression of viral load are potentially powerful interventions for reducing HIV incidence. A test-and-treat strategy may have long-term effects on the epidemic among urban men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States and may achieve the 5-year goals of the 2010 National AIDS Strategy that include: 1) lowering to 25\% the annual number of new infections, 2) reducing by 30\% the HIV transmission rate, 3) increasing to 90\% the proportion of persons living with HIV infection who know their HIV status, 4) increasing to 85\% the proportion of newly diagnosed patients linked to clinical care, and 5) increasing by 20\% the proportion of HIV-infected MSM with an undetectable HIV RNA viral load.We constructed a dynamic compartmental model among MSM in an urban population (based on New York City) that projects new HIV infections over time. We compared the cumulative number of HIV infections in 20 years, assuming current annual testing rate and treatment practices, with new infections after improvements in the annual HIV testing rate, notification of test results, linkage to care, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and viral load suppression. We also assessed whether five of the national HIV prevention goals could be met by the year 2015. Over a 20-year period, improvements in test-and-treat practice decreased the cumulative number of new infections by a predicted 39.3\% to 69.1\% in the urban population based on New York City. Institution of intermediate improvements in services would be predicted to meet at least four of the five goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy by the 2015 target.Improving the five components of a test-and-treat strategy could substantially reduce HIV incidence among urban MSM, and meet most of the five goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.},

It has been recently used to assess the ability to stop a pandemic at a very early stage. Here, we model the global diffusion of pandemic influenza and the impact of available preventive and control measures. We refined a published SEIR deterministic model of disease dynamics within 52 cities interconnected via air transport to simulate the impact of five interventions in a variety of scenarios: vaccination, case isolation, therapeutic and prophylactic antiviral treatment, and air traffic reduction. The impact of these measures was assessed on the spread of a potential pandemic strain profile, with an average attack-rate of 26\%, a case-fatality rate of 2.5\% and a residual immunity of 25\%. Our analysis highlighted the importance of: (1) a global perspective for dealing with pandemic risks; (2) the time factor and, hence, the importance of surveillance systems; (3) the complementary role of available control measures. Results provide general guidance for the issues of concern to public-health decision-makers: when to set up interventions, where, and at which administrative levels.},

However, disease elimination has proven an elusive goal, with only one human and one animal pathogen globally eradicated.

A well-established mathematical model of TB transmission built on previous models was adopted to study the potential impact of TB transmission. A probabilistic risk model was also developed to estimate site-specific risks of developing disease soon after recent primary infection, exogenous reinfection, or through endogenous reactivation (latently infected TB) among Taiwan regions. Here, we showed that the proportion of endogenous reactivation (53-67\%) was larger than that of exogenous reinfection (32-47\%). Our simulations showed that as epidemic reaches a steady state, age distribution of cases would finally shift toward older age groups dominated by latently infected TB cases as a result of endogenous reactivation. A comparison of age-weighted TB incidence data with our model simulation output with 95\% credible intervals revealed that the predictions were in an apparent agreement with observed data. The median value of overall basic reproduction number (R₀) in eastern Taiwan ranged from 1.65 to 1.72, whereas northern Taiwan had the lowest R₀ estimate of 1.50. We found that total TB incidences in eastern Taiwan had 25-27\% probabilities of total proportion of infected population exceeding 90\%, whereas there were 36-66\% probabilities having exceeded 20\% of total proportion of infected population attributed to latently infected TB. We suggested that our Taiwan-based analysis can be extended to the context of developing countries, where TB remains a substantial cause of elderly morbidity and mortality.},

However, the protected compartment may also slow the ascent of bacteria resistant to drugs not active in it (e.g. isoniazid) by providing a reservoir of non-selected mycobacteria. The model predicts that relative rates of killing are more important than mutation rates in determining the order in which resistant mutants ascend. Model predictions, in combination with data about drug resistance patterns, suggest that non-compliance, but not heterogeneity, is an important cause of treatment failure.Patterns of acquired drug resistance may be used to infer processes of selection during treatment; mathematical models can aid in generating predictions about the relative impacts of treatment parameters in the evolution of resistance, and eventually in suggesting improved treatment protocols.},

  abstract    = {Developing effective tuberculosis (TB) vaccines is a high priority. We use mathematical models to predict the potential public health impact of new TB vaccines in high-incidence countries. We show that preexposure vaccines would be almost twice as effective as postexposure vaccines in reducing the number of new infections. Postexposure vaccines would initially have a substantially greater impact, compared to preexposure vaccines, on reducing the number of new cases of disease. However, the effectiveness of postexposure vaccines would diminish over time, whereas the effectiveness of preexposure vaccines would increase. Thus, after 20 to 30 years, post- or preexposure vaccination campaigns would be almost equally effective in terms of cumulative TB cases prevented. Even widely deployed and highly effective (50\%-90\% efficacy) pre- or postexposure vaccines would only be able to reduce the number of TB cases by one third. We discuss the health policy implications of our analyses.},

  abstract    = {Recurrent episodes of tuberculosis (TB) can be due to relapse of latent infection or exogenous reinfection, and discrimination is crucial for control planning. Molecular genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates offers concrete opportunities to measure the relative contribution of reinfection in recurrent disease. Here, a mathematical model of TB transmission is fitted to data from 14 molecular epidemiology studies, enabling the estimation of relevant epidemiological parameters. Meta-analysis reveals that rates of reinfection after successful treatment are higher than rates of new TB, raising an important question about the underlying mechanism. We formulate two alternative mechanisms within our model framework: (i) infection increases susceptibility to reinfection or (ii) infection affects individuals differentially, thereby recruiting high-risk individuals to the group at risk for reinfection. The second mechanism is better supported by the fittings to the data, suggesting that reinfection rates are inflated through a population phenomenon that occurs in the presence of heterogeneity in individual risk of infection. As a result, rates of reinfection are higher when measured at the population level even though they might be lower at the individual level. Finally, differential host recruitment is modulated by transmission intensity, being less pronounced when incidence is high.},

Using Spectrum software and census data, we estimated the national burden of HIV disease and the effect of selected HIV-related prevention and treatment programmes.In 2005, we estimated that there were 135,300 new HIV infections (adult HIV incidence 0.96\%), 691,900 asymptomatic prevalent infections, 88 100 AIDS cases, and 76 400 AIDS deaths. An estimated 647,000 (80\%) HIV-infected adults were unaware of their infection; one third of all adult deaths were HIV related. As a result of population growth, by 2008 a similar number of people will be HIV infected (1.1 million) as during the peak of the epidemic in 1994. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage is expected to rise from 67,000 (2005) to 160,000 (2010), the number of persons needing but not receiving ART will decrease only slightly from 127,600 (2005) to 111,100 (2010). The use of single-dose in 2005 nevirapine probably averted only 4\% of the estimated 20 400 vertical infections.HIV/AIDS continues to be a leading cause of adult disease and death in Uganda. Universal ART access is probably unachievable. With the absolute burden of HIV disease approaching the historic peak in the early 1990s, more effective prevention programmes are of paramount importance.},

  abstract    = {Although the prevalence of tuberculosis continues to decline in most developed countries, the risk of healthcare-associated tuberculosis, remains for patients or healthcare staff. Outbreaks of healthcare-associated tuberculosis are usually associated with delays in diagnosis and treatment, or the care of patients in sub-optimal facilities. The control and prevention of tuberculosis in hospitals is best achieved by three approaches, namely administrative (early investigation diagnosis, etc.), engineering (physical facilities e.g. ventilated isolation rooms) and personal respiratory protection (face sealing masks which are filtered). Recent guidelines on the prevention of tuberculosis in healthcare facilities from Europe and the USA have many common themes. In the UK, however, negative pressure isolation rooms are recommended only for patients with suspected multi-drug resistant TB and personal respiratory protection, i.e. filtered masks, are not considered necessary unless multi-drug resistant TB is suspected, or where aerosol-generating procedures are likely. In the US, the standard of care for patients with infectious tuberculosis is a negative pressure ventilated room and the use of personal respiratory protection for all healthcare workers entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis. The absence of clinical trials in this area precludes dogmatic recommendations. Nonetheless, observational studies and mathematical modelling suggest that all measures are required for effective prevention. Even when policies and facilities are optimal, there is a need to regularly review and audit these as sometimes compliance is less than optimal. The differences in recommendations may reflect the variations in epidemiology and the greater use of BCG vaccination in the UK compared with the United States. There is a strong argument for advising ventilated facilities and personal respiratory protection for the care of all patients with tuberculosis, as multi-drug tuberculosis may not always be apparent on admission, and these measures minimise transmission of all cases of TB to other patients and healthcare staff.},

A recent South African court case described the conditions under which prisoners awaiting trial were kept. With the use of these data, a mathematical model was developed to explore the interactions between incarceration conditions and TB control measures.Cell dimensions, cell occupancy, lock-up time, TB incidence and treatment delays were derived from court evidence and judicial reports. Using the Wells-Riley equation and probability analyses of contact between prisoners, we estimated the current TB transmission probability within prison cells, and estimated transmission probabilities of improved levels of case finding in combination with implementation of national and international minimum standards for incarceration.Levels of overcrowding (230\%) in communal cells and poor TB case finding result in annual TB transmission risks of 90\% per annum. Implementing current national or international cell occupancy recommendations would reduce TB transmission probabilities by 30\% and 50\%, respectively. Improved passive case finding, modest ventilation increase or decreased lock-up time would minimally impact on transmission if introduced individually. However, active case finding together with implementation of minimum national and international standards of incarceration could reduce transmission by 50\% and 94\%, respectively.Current conditions of detention for awaiting-trial prisoners are highly conducive for spread of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. Combinations of simple well-established scientific control measures should be implemented urgently.},

We determined the minimum effect that INSPIRE must have on condom use among participants for the intervention to be cost-saving (intervention cost less than savings from averted HIV infections) or cost-effective (net cost per quality-adjusted life year saved less than $50,000).The intervention cost was $870 per participant. It would be cost-saving if it led to 53 percent reduction in the proportion of participants who had any unprotected sex in 1 year and cost-effective with 17 percent reduction. If behavior change lasted 3 months, the cost-effectiveness threshold was 66 percent; if 3 years, the threshold was 6 percent.Although cost-saving thresholds may not be achievable by the intervention, we anticipate that cost-effectiveness thresholds will be attained.},

Neonatal vaccination with the portfolio vaccine decreases TB incidence by 39\% to 52\% by 2050. Drug regimens that shorten treatment duration and are efficacious against drug-resistant strains reduce incidence by 10-27\%. New diagnostics reduce incidence by 13-42\%. A triple combination of a portfolio vaccine, drug regimen, and diagnostics reduces incidence by 71\%. A short mass vaccination catch-up campaign, not yet in the portfolio, to augment the triple combination, accelerates the decrease, preventing >30\% more cases by 2050 than just the triple combination. New vaccines and drug regimens targeted at the vast reservoir of latently infected people, not in the portfolio, would reduce incidence by 37\% and 82\%, respectively. The combination of preventive latent therapy and a 2-month drug treatment regimen reduces incidence by 94\%. Novel technologies in the pipeline would achieve substantial reductions in TB incidence, but not the Stop TB Partnership target for elimination.

  abstract    = {We present a novel conformal Bayesian network (CBN) to classify strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC) into six major genetic lineages based on two high-throuput biomarkers: mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU) and spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping). MTBC is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), which remains one of the leading causes of disease and morbidity world-wide. DNA fingerprinting methods such as MIRU and spoligotyping are key components in the control and tracking of modern TB.CBN is designed to exploit background knowledge about MTBC biomarkers. It can be trained on large historical TB databases of various subsets of MTBC biomarkers. During TB control efforts not all biomarkers may be available. So, CBN is designed to predict the major lineage of isolates genotyped by any combination of the PCR-based typing methods: spoligotyping and MIRU typing. CBN achieves high accuracy on three large MTBC collections consisting of over 34,737 isolates genotyped by different combinations of spoligotypes, 12 loci of MIRU, and 24 loci of MIRU. CBN captures distinct MIRU and spoligotype signatures associated with each lineage, explaining its excellent performance. Visualization of MIRU and spoligotype signatures yields insight into both how the model works and the genetic diversity of MTBC.CBN conforms to the available PCR-based biological markers and achieves high performance in identifying major lineages of MTBC. The method can be readily extended as new biomarkers are introduced for TB tracking and control. An online tool (http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~bennek/tbinsight/tblineage) makes the CBN model available for TB control and research efforts.},

  abstract    = {There are both pharmacodynamic and evolutionary reasons to use multiple rather than single antibiotics to treat bacterial infections; in combination antibiotics can be more effective in killing target bacteria as well as in preventing the emergence of resistance. Nevertheless, with few exceptions like tuberculosis, combination therapy is rarely used for bacterial infections. One reason for this is a relative dearth of the pharmaco-, population- and evolutionary dynamic information needed for the rational design of multi-drug treatment protocols. Here, we use in vitro pharmacodynamic experiments, mathematical models and computer simulations to explore the relative efficacies of different two-drug regimens in clearing bacterial infections and the conditions under which multi-drug therapy will prevent the ascent of resistance. We estimate the parameters and explore the fit of Hill functions to compare the pharmacodynamics of antibiotics of four different classes individually and in pairs during cidal experiments with pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. We also consider the relative efficacy of these antibiotics and antibiotic pairs in reducing the level of phenotypically resistant but genetically susceptible, persister, subpopulations. Our results provide compelling support for the proposition that the nature and form of the interactions between drugs of different classes, synergy, antagonism, suppression and additivity, has to be determined empirically and cannot be inferred from what is known about the pharmacodynamics or mode of action of these drugs individually. Monte Carlo simulations of within-host treatment incorporating these pharmacodynamic results and clinically relevant refuge subpopulations of bacteria indicate that: (i) the form of drug-drug interactions can profoundly affect the rate at which infections are cleared, (ii) two-drug therapy can prevent treatment failure even when bacteria resistant to single drugs are present at the onset of therapy, and (iii) this evolutionary virtue of two-drug therapy is manifest even when the antibiotics suppress each other's activity.},

We analyzed the transmission dynamics of XDR TB in the region using mathematical models, and observed that nosocomial transmission clusters of XDR TB may emerge into community-based epidemics under the public health conditions of many South African communities. The effective reproductive number of XDR TB in KwaZulu-Natal may be around 2. Intensified community-based case finding and therapy appears critical to curtailing transmission. In the setting of delayed disease presentation and high system demand, improved diagnostic approaches may need to be employed in community-based programs rather than exclusively at tertiary hospitals. Using branching process mathematics, we observed that early, community-based drug-susceptibility testing and effective XDR therapy could help curtail ongoing transmission and reduce the probability of XDR TB epidemics in neighboring territories.},

We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number R loc ). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia, and Europe. We investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.},

Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively. Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.

The second model calculates the probability that an infected traveller will generate at least one secondary autochthonous case in the visited country. Although this paper focuses on the data from China, our methods can be adapted to calculate the risk of importation and subsequent outbreaks. We found an average R0 = 5.31 (ranging from 4.08 to 7.91) and a risk of spreading of 0.75 latent individuals per 1000 travellers. In addition, one infective traveller would be able to generate at least one secondary autochthonous case in the visited country with a probability of 23%.},

Within 2 mo since the outbreak was first reported on December 31, 2019, a total of 566 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-2) cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries. Travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in China and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. We estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% on January 13, 2020. We found that 779 cases (95% CI: 632 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5% (95% CI: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average. At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response.},

  abstract        = {Contact tracing is a central public health response to infectious disease outbreaks, especially in the early stages of an outbreak when specific treatments are limited. Importation of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the UK highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. Detailed survey information on social encounters from over 5800 respondents is coupled to predictive models of contact tracing and control. This is used to investigate the likely efficacy of contact tracing and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission we predict that under effective contact tracing less than 1 in 6 cases will generate any subsequent untraced infections, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36 individuals traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we find that tracing using a contact definition requiring more than 4 hours of contact is unlikely to control spread. The current contact tracing strategy within the UK is likely to identify a sufficient proportion of infected individuals such that subsequent spread could be prevented, although the ultimate success will depend on the rapid detection of cases and isolation of contacts. Given the burden of tracing a large number of contacts to find new cases, there is the potential the system could be overwhelmed if imports of infection occur at a rapid rate.},

We simulated infected air travellers arriving into countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission or other introduction routes from affected regions. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduces the average number of secondary cases. We use stochastic simulations to account for uncertainty in both arrival and secondary infections rates, and present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. We report the median expected delay achievable in each scenario and an inner 50% interval. Under baseline assumptions, introducing exit and entry screening in combination with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by 8 days (50% interval: 3-14 days) when the rate of importation is 1 infected traveller per week at time of introduction. The additional benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by 7 days (50% interval: 2-13 days). In the absence of screening, with less effective sensitisation, or a higher rate of importation, these delays shrink rapidly to less than 4 days. Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination may have marginally delayed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in unaffected countries.},

It has been assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single attack, and that an individual is not infective at the moment at which he receives infection. With these reservations the problem has been investigated in its most general aspects, and the following conclusions have been arrived at. (2) In general a threshold density of population is found to exist, which depends upon the infectivity, recovery and death rates peculiar to the epidemic. No epidemic can occur if the population density is below this threshold value. (3) Small increases of the infectivity rate may lead to large epidemics; also, if the population density slightly exceeds its threshold value the effect of an epidemic will be to reduce the density as far below the threshold value as initially it was above it. (4) An epidemic, in general, comes to an end, before the susceptible population has been exhausted. (5) Similar results are indicated for the case in which transmission is through an intermediate host.},

  abstract        = {The phenomenon of backward bifurcation in disease models, where a stable endemic equilibrium co-exists with a stable disease-free equilibrium when the associated reproduction number is less than unity, has important implications for disease control. In such a scenario, the classical requirement of the reproduction number being less than unity becomes only a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for disease elimination. This paper addresses the role of the choice of incidence function in a vaccine-induced backward bifurcation in HIV models. Several examples are given where backward bifurcations occur using standard incidence, but not with their equivalents that employ mass action incidence. Furthermore, this result is independent of the type of vaccination program adopted. These results emphasize the need for further work on the incidence functions used in HIV models.},

In addition, avian influenza A (H5N1) continues to circulate and remains a threat. Currently, influenza H7N9 vaccines are being tested to be stockpiled along with H5N1 vaccines. These vaccines require two doses, 21 days apart, for maximal protection. We developed a mathematical model to evaluate two possible strategies for allocating limited vaccine supplies: a one-dose strategy, where a larger number of people are vaccinated with a single dose, or a two-dose strategy, where half as many people are vaccinated with two doses. We prove that there is a threshold in the level of protection obtained after the first dose, below which vaccinating with two doses results in a lower illness attack rate than with the one-dose strategy; but above the threshold, the one-dose strategy would be better. For reactive vaccination, we show that the optimal use of vaccine depends on several parameters, with the most important one being the level of protection obtained after the first dose. We describe how these vaccine dosing strategies can be integrated into effective pandemic control plans.},

  abstract        = {With new cases of avian influenza H5N1 (H5N1AV) arising frequently, the threat of a new influenza pandemic remains a challenge for public health. Several vaccines have been developed specifically targeting H5N1AV, but their production is limited and only a few million doses are readily available. Because there is an important time lag between the emergence of new pandemic strain and the development and distribution of a vaccine, shortage of vaccine is very likely at the beginning of a pandemic. We coupled a mathematical model with a genetic algorithm to optimally and dynamically distribute vaccine in a network of cities, connected by the airline transportation network. By minimizing the illness attack rate (i.e., the percentage of people in the population who become infected and ill), we focus on optimizing vaccine allocation in a network of 16 cities in Southeast Asia when only a few million doses are available. In our base case, we assume the vaccine is well-matched and vaccination occurs 5 to 10 days after the beginning of the epidemic. The effectiveness of all the vaccination strategies drops off as the timing is delayed or the vaccine is less well-matched. Under the best assumptions, optimal vaccination strategies substantially reduced the illness attack rate, with a maximal reduction in the attack rate of 85%. Furthermore, our results suggest that cooperative strategies where the resources are optimally distributed among the cities perform much better than the strategies where the vaccine is equally distributed among the network, yielding an illness attack rate 17% lower. We show that it is possible to significantly mitigate a more global epidemic with limited quantities of vaccine, provided that the vaccination campaign is extremely fast and it occurs within the first weeks of transmission.},

We used a stochastic influenza simulation model for rural Southeast Asia to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, quarantine, and pre-vaccination in containing an emerging influenza strain at the source. If the basic reproductive number (R0) was below 1.60, our simulations showed that a prepared response with targeted antivirals would have a high probability of containing the disease. In that case, an antiviral agent stockpile on the order of 100,000 to 1 million courses for treatment and prophylaxis would be sufficient. If pre-vaccination occurred, then targeted antiviral prophylaxis could be effective for containing strains with an R0 as high as 2.1. Combinations of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, pre-vaccination, and quarantine could contain strains with an R(0) as high as 2.4.},

  abstract        = {For the first wave of pandemic influenza or a bioterrorist influenza attack, antiviral agents would be one of the few options to contain the epidemic in the United States until adequate supplies of vaccine were available. The authors use stochastic epidemic simulations to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis to contain influenza. In this strategy, close contacts of suspected index influenza cases take antiviral agents prophylactically. The authors compare targeted antiviral prophylaxis with vaccination strategies. They model an influenza pandemic or bioterrorist attack for an agent similar to influenza A virus (H2N2) that caused the Asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958. In the absence of intervention, the model predicts an influenza illness attack rate of 33% of the population (95% confidence interval (CI): 30, 37) and an influenza death rate of 0.58 deaths/1,000 persons (95% Cl: 0.4, 0.8). With the use of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, if 80% of the exposed persons maintained prophylaxis for up to 8 weeks, the epidemic would be contained, and the model predicts a reduction to an illness attack rate of 2% (95% Cl: 0.2, 16) and a death rate of 0.04 deaths/1,000 persons (95% CI: 0.0003, 0.25). Such antiviral prophylaxis is nearly as effective as vaccinating 80% of the population. Vaccinating 80% of the children aged less than 19 years is almost as effective as vaccinating 80% of the population. Targeted antiviral prophylaxis has potential as an effective measure for containing influenza until adequate quantities of vaccine are available.},

We introduce and use a large-scale stochastic simulation model to investigate the spread of a pandemic strain of influenza virus through the U.S. population of 281 million individuals for R(0) (the basic reproductive number) from 1.6 to 2.4. We model the impact that a variety of levels and combinations of influenza antiviral agents, vaccines, and modified social mobility (including school closure and travel restrictions) have on the timing and magnitude of this spread. Our simulations demonstrate that, in a highly mobile population, restricting travel after an outbreak is detected is likely to delay slightly the time course of the outbreak without impacting the eventual number ill. For R(0) < 1.9, our model suggests that the rapid production and distribution of vaccines, even if poorly matched to circulating strains, could significantly slow disease spread and limit the number ill to <10% of the population, particularly if children are preferentially vaccinated. Alternatively, the aggressive deployment of several million courses of influenza antiviral agents in a targeted prophylaxis strategy may contain a nascent outbreak with low R(0), provided adequate contact tracing and distribution capacities exist. For higher R(0), we predict that multiple strategies in combination (involving both social and medical interventions) will be required to achieve similar limits on illness rates.},

Because of this year's influenza vaccine shortage, a plan was enacted to distribute the limited vaccine stock to these groups first. This vaccination strategy, based on direct protection of those most at risk, has not been very effective in reducing influenza morbidity and mortality. Although it is too late to make changes this year, the current influenza vaccine crisis affords the opportunity to examine an alternative for future years. The alternative plan, supported by mathematical models and influenza field studies, would be to concentrate vaccine in schoolchildren, the population group most responsible for transmission, while also covering the reachable high-risk groups, who would also receive considerable indirect protection. In conjunction with a plan to ensure an adequate vaccine supply, this alternative influenza vaccination strategy would help control interpandemic influenza and be instrumental in preparing for pandemic influenza. The effectiveness of the alternative plan could be assessed through nationwide community studies.},

In these studies, control of a single outbreak is considered. It is, however, not clear how one should handle a situation where multiple outbreaks are likely to occur. Here, we identify the best control strategy for such a situation. We further discuss ways in which such a strategy can be implemented to achieve additional public health objectives.},

In the absence of a global or regional body that can impose a universal vaccination strategy, each individual country sets its own strategy. Mobility of populations across borders can promote free-riding, because a country can benefit from the vaccination efforts of its neighbours, which can result in vaccination coverage lower than the global optimum. Here we explore whether voluntary coalitions that reward countries that join by cooperatively increasing vaccination coverage can solve this problem. We use dynamic epidemiological models embedded in a game-theoretic framework in order to identify conditions in which coalitions are self-enforcing and therefore stable, and thus successful at promoting a cooperative vaccination strategy. We find that countries can achieve significantly greater vaccination coverage at a lower cost by forming coalitions than when acting independently, provided a coalition has the tools to deter free-riding. Furthermore, when economically or epidemiologically asymmetric countries form coalitions, realized coverage is regionally more consistent than in the absence of coalitions.},

We firstly provide an overview of the concepts and results of mathematical epidemiology and public health. Secondly, we present an introduction to the mathematical modelling of measles using deterministic and stochastic approaches for both single and multiple populations. Lastly, we develop a model for mass gatherings and present an application to measles during the Hajj by studying an SIR deterministic metapopulation model with residency and its stochastic analogue. The models incorporate real world country data and time dependent movement and transmission rates, accounting for realistic volume of international travel and seasonality of measles activity. Numerical results for the deterministic system are presented. We conclude with a discussion on further work.},
