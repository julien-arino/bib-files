		  Neonatal vaccination with the portfolio vaccine decreases
		  TB incidence by 39\% to 52\% by 2050. Drug regimens that

		  vaccination catch-up campaign, not yet in the portfolio, to
		  augment the triple combination, accelerates the decrease,
		  preventing >30\% more cases by 2050 than just the triple
		  combination. New vaccines and drug regimens targeted at the
		  vast reservoir of latently infected people, not in the

		  substantial reductions in TB incidence, but not the Stop TB

		  require new delivery strategies, such as mass vaccination

		  extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB), potent
		  new drugs are urgently needed. Linezolid is a promising
		  drug, but its use is limited by adverse effects with
		  prolonged administration of 600 mg twice daily. In order to
		  reduce its adverse effects and maintain efficacy, we
		  investigated whether linezolid in a reduced dosage resulted
		  in drug serum concentrations exceeding a ratio of the in
		  vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to the area
		  under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) over 24
		  hours (AUC(24)) [AUC(24)/MIC] of >100.This open-label,
		  prospective pharmacokinetic study evaluated two doses (300
		  and 600 mg) of linezolid in MDR-TB patients, who received
		  linezolid as part of their treatment. They received
		  linezolid 300 mg twice daily for 3 days, followed by 600 mg
		  twice daily. Blood samples taken at predefined intervals
		  for measuring serum linezolid concentrations were processed
		  by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass
		  spectrometry procedure. The AUC(24)/MIC ratio was used as a
		  predictive model of efficacy. Adverse effects of linezolid,
		  including peripheral neuropathy, were evaluated by clinical
		  and laboratory assessments.Eight patients were included in
		  this study. The median duration of linezolid treatment was
		  56 days (interquartile range [IQR 44-82] days), with a
		  median cumulative dose of 51,000 mg (IQR 33,850-60,450 mg).
		  The median linezolid AUC over 12 hours (AUC(12)) values
		  were 57.6 mg x h/L (IQR 38.5-64.2 mg x h/L) with the 300 mg
		  dose and 145.8 mg x h/L (IQR 101.2-160.9 mg x h/L) with the
		  600 mg dose. The AUC(24)/MIC ratios were 452 (IQR 343-513)
		  with the 300 mg dose and 1151 (IQR 656-1500) with the 600
		  mg dose. Linezolid was well tolerated.Seemingly effective
		  serum concentrations were reached after 3 days of
		  administration of linezolid 300 mg twice daily, i.e. the
		  AUC(24)/MIC ratio was at least 100 in 7 of 8 patients.
		  Larger numbers of patients should be studied to confirm the
		  efficacy of the linezolid 300 mg twice-daily dosage in

		  classify strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex
		  (MTBC) into six major genetic lineages based on two
		  high-throuput biomarkers: mycobacterial interspersed
		  repetitive units (MIRU) and spacer oligonucleotide typing
		  (spoligotyping). MTBC is the causative agent of
		  tuberculosis (TB), which remains one of the leading causes
		  of disease and morbidity world-wide. DNA fingerprinting
		  methods such as MIRU and spoligotyping are key components
		  in the control and tracking of modern TB.CBN is designed to
		  exploit background knowledge about MTBC biomarkers. It can
		  be trained on large historical TB databases of various
		  subsets of MTBC biomarkers. During TB control efforts not
		  all biomarkers may be available. So, CBN is designed to
		  predict the major lineage of isolates genotyped by any
		  combination of the PCR-based typing methods: spoligotyping
		  and MIRU typing. CBN achieves high accuracy on three large
		  MTBC collections consisting of over 34,737 isolates
		  genotyped by different combinations of spoligotypes, 12
		  loci of MIRU, and 24 loci of MIRU. CBN captures distinct
		  MIRU and spoligotype signatures associated with each
		  lineage, explaining its excellent performance.
		  Visualization of MIRU and spoligotype signatures yields
		  insight into both how the model works and the genetic
		  diversity of MTBC.CBN conforms to the available PCR-based
		  biological markers and achieves high performance in
		  identifying major lineages of MTBC. The method can be
		  readily extended as new biomarkers are introduced for TB
		  tracking and control. An online tool

		  use multiple rather than single antibiotics to treat
		  bacterial infections; in combination antibiotics can be
		  more effective in killing target bacteria as well as in
		  preventing the emergence of resistance. Nevertheless, with
		  few exceptions like tuberculosis, combination therapy is
		  rarely used for bacterial infections. One reason for this
		  is a relative dearth of the pharmaco-, population- and
		  evolutionary dynamic information needed for the rational
		  design of multi-drug treatment protocols. Here, we use in
		  vitro pharmacodynamic experiments, mathematical models and
		  computer simulations to explore the relative efficacies of
		  different two-drug regimens in clearing bacterial
		  infections and the conditions under which multi-drug
		  therapy will prevent the ascent of resistance. We estimate

		  experiments with pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus
		  aureus and Escherichia coli. We also consider the relative
		  efficacy of these antibiotics and antibiotic pairs in
		  reducing the level of phenotypically resistant but

		  results provide compelling support for the proposition that

		  additivity, has to be determined empirically and cannot be
		  inferred from what is known about the pharmacodynamics or

		  simulations of within-host treatment incorporating these
		  pharmacodynamic results and clinically relevant refuge
		  subpopulations of bacteria indicate that: (i) the form of
		  drug-drug interactions can profoundly affect the rate at
		  which infections are cleared, (ii) two-drug therapy can
		  prevent treatment failure even when bacteria resistant to

		  subject to the condition that the optimum for one

		  neighbours. This seems unlikely in vegetation stands where

		  between predicted plant traits and real values: plants tend
		  to be taller, distribute nitrogen more evenly among their
		  leaves and produce more leaf area which is projected more

		  theory to individual plant-based canopy models, other
		  studies have shown that optimal vegetation stands with

		  and doing whatever the other did on the previous encounter
		  in subsequent encounters with the same individual.
		  Encounters are restricted to individuals of the same

		  individuals. On any encounter, it is assumed that an

		  personal fitness proportional to c while improving his
		  partner's fitness by the same proportion of b. Then, the

  abstract	= {Infectious diseases are the second leading cause of death
		  worldwide. In order to better understand and treat them, an
		  accurate evaluation using multi-modal imaging techniques
		  for anatomical and functional characterizations is needed.
		  For non-invasive imaging techniques such as computed
		  tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and
		  positron emission tomography (PET), there have been many
		  engineering improvements that have significantly enhanced
		  the resolution and contrast of the images, but there are
		  still insufficient computational algorithms available for
		  researchers to use when accurately quantifying imaging data
		  from anatomical structures and functional biological
		  processes. Since the development of such tools may
		  potentially translate basic research into the clinic, this
		  study focuses on the development of a quantitative and
		  qualitative image analysis platform that provides a
		  computational radiology perspective for pulmonary
		  infections in small animal models. Specifically, we
		  designed (a) a fast and robust automated and semi-automated
		  image analysis platform and a quantification tool that can
		  facilitate accurate diagnostic measurements of pulmonary
		  lesions as well as volumetric measurements of anatomical
		  structures, and incorporated (b) an image registration
		  pipeline to our proposed framework for volumetric
		  comparison of serial scans. This is an important
		  investigational tool for small animal infectious disease
		  models that can help advance researchers' understanding of
		  infectious diseases.We tested the utility of our proposed
		  methodology by using sequentially acquired CT and PET
		  images of rabbit, ferret, and mouse models with respiratory
		  infections of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), H1N1 flu
		  virus, and an aerosolized respiratory pathogen (necrotic
		  TB) for a total of 92, 44, and 24 scans for the respective
		  studies with half of the scans from CT and the other half
		  from PET. Institutional Administrative Panel on Laboratory
		  Animal Care approvals were obtained prior to conducting
		  this research. First, the proposed computational framework
		  registered PET and CT images to provide spatial
		  correspondences between images. Second, the lungs from the
		  CT scans were segmented using an interactive region growing
		  (IRG) segmentation algorithm with mathematical morphology
		  operations to avoid false positive (FP) uptake in PET
		  images. Finally, we segmented significant radiotracer
		  uptake from the PET images in lung regions determined from
		  CT and computed metabolic volumes of the significant
		  uptake. All segmentation processes were compared with
		  expert radiologists' delineations (ground truths).
		  Metabolic and gross volume of lesions were automatically
		  computed with the segmentation processes using PET and CT
		  images, and percentage changes in those volumes over time
		  were calculated. (Continued on next page)(Continued from
		  previous page) Standardized uptake value (SUV) analysis
		  from PET images was conducted as a complementary
		  quantitative metric for disease severity assessment. Thus,
		  severity and extent of pulmonary lesions were examined
		  through both PET and CT images using the aforementioned
		  quantification metrics outputted from the proposed
		  framework.Each animal study was evaluated within the same
		  subject class, and all steps of the proposed methodology
		  were evaluated separately. We quantified the accuracy of
		  the proposed algorithm with respect to the state-of-the-art
		  segmentation algorithms. For evaluation of the segmentation
		  results, dice similarity coefficient (DSC) as an overlap
		  measure and Haussdorf distance as a shape dissimilarity
		  measure were used. Significant correlations regarding the
		  estimated lesion volumes were obtained both in CT and PET
		  images with respect to the ground truths (R2=0.8922,p<0.01
		  and R2=0.8664,p<0.01, respectively). The segmentation
		  accuracy (DSC (\%)) was 93.4Ã‚Â±4.5\% for normal lung
		  CT scans and 86.0Ã‚Â±7.1\% for pathological lung CT
		  scans. Experiments showed excellent agreements (all above
		  85\%) with expert evaluations for both structural and
		  functional imaging modalities. Apart from quantitative
		  analysis of each animal, we also qualitatively showed how
		  metabolic volumes were changing over time by examining
		  serial PET/CT scans. Evaluation of the registration
		  processes was based on precisely defined anatomical
		  landmark points by expert clinicians. An average of 2.66,
		  3.93, and 2.52 mm errors was found in rabbit, ferret, and
		  mouse data (all within the resolution limits),
		  respectively. Quantitative results obtained from the
		  proposed methodology were visually related to the progress
		  and severity of the pulmonary infections as verified by the
		  participating radiologists. Moreover, we demonstrated that
		  lesions due to the infections were metabolically active and
		  appeared multi-focal in nature, and we observed similar
		  patterns in the CT images as well. Consolidation and ground
		  glass opacity were the main abnormal imaging patterns and
		  consistently appeared in all CT images. We also found that
		  the gross and metabolic lesion volume percentage follow the
		  same trend as the SUV-based evaluation in the longitudinal
		  analysis.We explored the feasibility of using PET and CT
		  imaging modalities in three distinct small animal models
		  for two diverse pulmonary infections. We concluded from the
		  clinical findings, derived from the proposed computational
		  pipeline, that PET-CT imaging is an invaluable hybrid
		  modality for tracking pulmonary infections longitudinally
		  in small animals and has great potential to become
		  routinely used in clinics. Our proposed methodology showed
		  that automated computed-aided lesion detection and
		  quantification of pulmonary infections in small animal
		  models are efficient and accurate as compared to the
		  clinical standard of manual and semi-automated approaches.
		  Automated analysis of images in pre-clinical applications
		  can increase the efficiency and quality of pre-clinical
		  findings that ultimately inform downstream experimental
		  design in human clinical studies; this innovation will
		  allow researchers and clinicians to more effectively
		  allocate study resources with respect to research demands
		  without compromising accuracy.},

  abstract	= {Over one-third of the world's population has been exposed
		  to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). New drug designs are
		  necessitated by the appearance of multi-drug resistant
		  tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant
		  tuberculosis (XDR-TB). This work presents four hydrazide
		  compounds that inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth at
		  potency comparable to isoniazid. The hydrazide drugs A, B,
		  C, and D were synthesized utilizing microwave excitation
		  methodologies. Hydrazide agents are produced from parent
		  carboxyl compounds. All reactions were accomplished in dry
		  conditions. Using suitable molecular scaffolds the final
		  hydrazides possessed the desired properties in Log P, polar
		  surface area, molecular weight, etc. All four hydrazide
		  compounds induced at least 60\% inhibition of TB at
		  concentrations at less than 31.5 microgram/mL. Measured as
		  relative survival, all four hydrazide compounds induced
		  greater than 95\% death of TB bacteria at concentrations
		  less than 31.5 microgram/mL. Drugs A, B, C, D exhibited
		  zero violations of the Rule of 5, indicating favorable
		  bioavailability. Although isoniazid, A, B, C, and D were
		  determined to have a polar surface area less than 70
		  Angstroms2, the values of Log P (a measurement of
		  lipophilicity) showed a broad range of -1.463 (drug C) to
		  4.46 (drug A). The numerical values of polar surface area
		  suggests that all drugs would have greater than 50\%
		  intestinal absorption. For all drugs the number of amine
		  (-NH) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups remains constant at three,
		  with number of oxygens and nitrogens varying only three to
		  four. ANOSIM (analysis of similarity) indicated that
		  isoniazid, A, B, C, and D are highly similar. Correlation
		  of molecular properties for all five drugs is greater than
		  r = 0.9500. Drugs A, B, C, and D are members of two
		  homologous series of anti-tuberculosis agents. All
		  hydrazides effectively inhibited TB at 31.5 micrograms/mL
		  and lower concentrations.},

		  are placed together with the index case in confined spaces.
		  With this in mind, waiting areas of healthcare facilities
		  present a particular challenge, since large numbers of
		  people, some of whom may have underlying conditions which
		  predispose them to infection, congregate in such spaces and
		  can be exposed to an individual who may be shedding

		  important to understand the risks posed by infectious

		  developed to minimise the spread of airborne infections.A
		  stochastic Monte Carlo model was constructed to analyse the
		  transmission of airborne infection in a hypothetical 132 m3
		  hospital waiting area in which occupancy levels, waiting
		  times and ventilation rate can all be varied. In the model
		  the Gammaitoni-Nucci equation was utilized to predict
		  probability of susceptible individuals becoming infected.
		  The model was used to assess the risk of transmission of
		  three infectious diseases, TB, influenza and measles. In
		  order to allow for stochasticity a random number generator
		  was applied to the variables in the model and a total of
		  10000 individual simulations were undertaken. The mean
		  quanta production rates used in the study were 12.7, 100
		  and 570 per hour for TB, influenza and measles,
		  respectively.The results of the study revealed the mean
		  probability of acquiring a TB infection during a 30-minute
		  stay in the waiting area to be negligible (i.e. 0.0034),
		  while that for influenza was an order of magnitude higher
		  at 0.0262. By comparison the mean probability of acquiring
		  a measles infection during the same period was 0.1349. If
		  the duration of the stay was increased to 60 minutes then
		  these values increased to 0.0087, 0.0662 and 0.3094,
		  respectively.Under normal circumstances the risk of
		  acquiring a TB infection during a visit to a hospital
		  waiting area is minimal. Likewise the risks associated with
		  the transmission of influenza, although an order of
		  magnitude greater than those for TB, are relatively small.
		  By comparison, the risks associated with measles are high.
		  While the installation of air disinfection may be
		  beneficial, when seeking to prevent the transmission of
		  airborne viral infection it is important to first minimize
		  waiting times and the number of susceptible individuals
		  present before turning to expensive technological
		  solutions.},

		  commonly employs science-based mathematical models. For
		  instance, epidemiological dynamics of TB is dominated, in
		  general, by flow between actively and latently infected
		  populations. Thus modelling is central in planning public
		  health intervention. However, models are highly uncertain
		  because they are based on observations that are
		  geographically and temporally distinct from the population
		  to which they are applied.We aim to demonstrate the
		  advantages of info-gap theory, a non-probabilistic approach
		  to severe uncertainty when worst cases cannot be reliably
		  identified and probability distributions are unreliable or
		  unavailable. Info-gap is applied here to mathematical
		  modelling of epidemics and analysis of public health
		  decision-making.Applying info-gap robustness analysis to
		  tuberculosis/HIV (TB/HIV) epidemics, we illustrate the
		  critical role of incorporating uncertainty in formulating
		  recommendations for interventions. Robustness is assessed
		  as the magnitude of uncertainty that can be tolerated by a
		  given intervention. We illustrate the methodology by
		  exploring interventions that alter the rates of diagnosis,
		  cure, relapse and HIV infection.We demonstrate several
		  policy implications. Equivalence among alternative rates of
		  diagnosis and relapse are identified. The impact of initial
		  TB and HIV prevalence on the robustness to uncertainty is
		  quantified. In some configurations, increased
		  aggressiveness of intervention improves the predicted
		  outcome but also reduces the robustness to uncertainty.
		  Similarly, predicted outcomes may be better at larger
		  target times, but may also be more vulnerable to model
		  error.The info-gap framework is useful for managing model
		  uncertainty and is attractive when uncertainties on model
		  parameters are extreme. When a public health model
		  underlies guidelines, info-gap decision theory provides
		  valuable insight into the confidence of achieving
		  agreed-upon goals.},

		  published reports to estimate the rise of TB incidence as
		  the HIV epidemic expands.Two groups with different risk of
		  developing TB are identified: individuals with dual
		  infection of HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the
		  rest of the population. The model is based on a combination
		  of the incidence and the percentage of TB in these two
		  groups. The expected rise in TB incidence and the
		  percentage of TB cases that will be HIV-positive are
		  plotted against the prevalence of HIV.Unless appropriate
		  action is taken, TB incidence in developing countries will
		  double as the prevalence of HIV infection reaches 13 per
		  hundred adults.95\% of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the world
		  live in developing countries. HIV infection greatly
		  increases the risk of developing active TB among those with
		  latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Thus
		  researchers have used data from existing research to
		  develop a mathematical model to gauge the increase in TB
		  incidence in developing countries while considering rising
		  HIV prevalence among adults. They look at 2 groups with
		  sizable differences in risk of acquiring TB: adults with
		  both HIV and M. tuberculosis infections and all other
		  adults. The researchers plot the expected increase in TB
		  incidence and percentage of TB cases that also have HIV
		  infection against HIV prevalence. According to the model,
		  when the prevalence of HIV infection hits 13\% of adults in
		  developing countries, the number of new TB cases doubles.
		  Most of this increase will occur in areas that already lack
		  diagnostic services, drugs, hospital beds, and other needed
		  supplies. TB chemoprophylaxis treatment of HIV-positive
		  people could result in a lower increase in TB incidence,
		  however. WHO has set a goal of 50\% reduction in TB
		  incidence by 2002. Public health officials could use this
		  model to plan TB control programs to bring about a
		  reduction in the increase. Even though TB control programs
		  can help stem the projected increase, it will be very
		  difficult for developing countries with high HIV prevalence
		  to hold back the projected rise in TB incidence. Developing
		  countries must take considerable appropriate action soon to
		  prevent doubling of TB incidence as HIV prevalence nears
		  13\% of adults.},

		  for studying the transmission dynamics of an observed
		  epidemic involving a largely unsampled 'reservoir' host, as
		  for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in British and Irish cattle
		  and badgers. BTB is caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member
		  of the M. tuberculosis complex that also includes the
		  aetiological agent for human TB. In this study, we
		  identified a spatio-temporally linked group of 26 cattle
		  and 4 badgers infected with the same Variable Number Tandem
		  Repeat (VNTR) type of M. bovis. Single-nucleotide
		  polymorphisms (SNPs) between sequences identified

		  despite multiple clear whole herd tests in the interim.
		  Comparing WGS data to mathematical models showed good

		  distance, but poor correspondence to the network of cattle
		  movements or within-herd contacts. Badger isolates showed
		  between zero and four SNP differences from the nearest
		  cattle isolate, providing evidence for recent transmissions
		  between the two hosts. This is the first direct genetic
		  evidence of M. bovis persistence on farms over multiple
		  outbreaks with a continued, ongoing interaction with local
		  badgers. However, despite unprecedented resolution,
		  directionality of transmission cannot be inferred at this
		  stage. Despite the often notoriously long timescales
		  between time of infection and time of sampling for TB, our
		  results suggest that WGS data alone can provide insights
		  into TB epidemiology even where detailed contact data are
		  not available, and that more extensive sampling and

		  the decision to offer TB treatment and opportunities to
		  treat TB patients are often missed. This paper looks at the

		  model is used to calculate the risks and benefits of
		  different treatment scenarios with increasing default
		  rates. Model outcomes are compared to a situation without
		  treatment. An economic analysis further discusses the
		  findings in a trade-off between the extra costs of treating
		  relapses and failures and the savings in future treatment
		  costs. In complex emergencies, if a TB programme could
		  offer 4-month treatment for 75\% of its patients, it could
		  still be considered beneficial in terms of public health.
		  In addition, the proportion of patients following at least
		  4 months of treatment can be used as an indicator to help
		  evaluate the public health harm and benefit of the TB

		  this is occurring, public health commentators refer to the
		  activities of an anti-vaccination 'movement'. In the light
		  of three decades of research on (new) social movements,
		  what sense does it make to attribute decline in vaccination
		  rates to the actions of an influential anti-vaccination
		  movement? Two sorts of empirical data, drawn largely from
		  UK and The Netherlands, are reviewed. These relate to the
		  claims, actions and discourse of anti-vaccination groups on

		  think about vaccines and vaccination on the other. How much

		  as (new) social movement organizations (as distinct from
		  pressure groups or self-help organizations) is as yet
		  unclear. In any event there is no simple and unambiguous
		  demarcation criterion. From a public health perspective,
		  however, to focus attention on organized opponents of
		  vaccination is appealing because it unites health
		  professionals behind a banner of reason. At the same time
		  it diverts attention from a potentially disruptive critique
		  of vaccination practices; the critique in fact articulated
		  by many parents. In the light of current theoretical
		  discussion of 'scientific citizenship' this paper argues
		  that identifying anti-vaccination groups with other social

		  several energy filtered images. One major problem
		  encountered in the processing of such sequences of images
		  lies in the extrapolation errors due to a difficult
		  estimate of the background below the characteristic signal.
		  The chosen method must be sufficiently reliable to avoid
		  the risk of both "false positive" and "false negative"
		  values: the first category may stem from spurious signals
		  or from a non-satisfactory fit of the background. The
		  second category is mainly due to a limited sensitivity. The

		  intensity; an extrapolation error can therefore transform a
		  negative value into a positive one, or vice versa. The
		  purpose of the present contribution is to check the
		  validity of the processing at different levels: i)
		  different mathematical models of background; ii) different
		  types of fitting procedures (one-parameter and
		  two-parameters fits); iii) different fitting methods and

		  oriented along the long axis of the vertebral body. We
		  showed that 3D MRmicroI can detect the subtle changes in
		  trabecular architecture between the two age groups. ConnD,
		  star volume, \% plate, \% boneLD, and BV/TV were found to
		  be more effective than the model-based, derived indices
		  (trabecular thickness [Tb.Th], trabecular separation
		  [Tb.Sp], and trabecular number [Tb.N]) in differentiating
		  the structural changes. BV/TV, \% plate, and \% boneLD
		  significantly increased (p < 0.05) in all three vertebral
		  sites of the mature minipigs. The significant decrease in
		  ConnD and star volume in the mature vertebra was consistent
		  with the concurrent increase of platelike trabecular bone
		  (p < 0.05). Overall, ConnD, star volume, \% plate, and \%
		  boneLD provided a coherent picture of the architectural
		  changes between the two age groups. Apparent modulus and
		  maximum stress were determined experimentally on biopsy
		  specimens from L2 vertebrae (n = 16). When apparent modulus
		  was predicted using 3D MRmicroI data sets as input for
		  finite element modeling (FEM), the results were similar to
		  the experimentally determined apparent modulus (p = 0.12).
		  Both methods were then used to compare the young and the
		  mature animals; the experimental and predicted apparent
		  modulus were significantly higher for the mature group (p =
		  0.003 and 0.012, respectively). The experimental maximum
		  stress in the vertebra of the mature animals was twice as
		  high as that for the young animals (p = 0.006). Bone
		  quantity (BV/TV or bone mineral content [BMC]) alone could
		  explain approximately 74-85\% of the total variability in
		  stress and modulus. The inclusion of either ConnD or \%
		  boneLD with BV/TV in a multiple regression analysis
		  significantly improved the predictability of maximum
		  stress, indicating that architecture makes additional
		  contributions to compressive strength in normal minipig vertebra.},

		  MDR strains can be up to 10 times more or 10 times less

		  M. tuberculosis can be influenced by the specific drug
		  resistance-conferring mutation and strain genetic
		  background. Furthermore, compensatory evolution, which has

		  history, the impact of demography on the behaviour of TB

		  interventions. We focus our analytic arguments on the

		  were defined according to information derived from
		  published literature and were supplemented by estimates
		  provided by members of the Global Pertussis Initiative.
		  Both direct and indirect costs were included (in 2002 US
		  dollars) using U.S. data. Outcomes were evaluated over the
		  lifetime of a cohort of potential adolescent vaccine
		  candidates. Because of uncertainty in many of the inputs,
		  extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. With 80\%
		  vaccination coverage of adolescents and a 20\% reduction of
		  other cases because of herd immunity, >68,000 cases and 41
		  pertussis-related deaths would be avoided in the subsequent
		  10 years by routine administration of acellular pertussis
		  boosters to a single cohort of adolescents in the United
		  States. This strategy would be cost-effective, incurring
		  from 6000 US dollars to 22,000 US dollars per life-year
		  gained. The level of herd immunity attained and the true
		  incidence of pertussis are critical determinants of cost
		  effectiveness, as is the duration of immunity resulting
		  from immunization. The cost of immunization and the
		  discount rate also play a role. Although there is
		  considerable uncertainty surrounding key inputs, the
		  results indicate that the conditions required for
		  adolescent immunization to be economically warranted are
		  realistic.},

		  wild-type influenza virus. A total of 56 different studies
		  with 1,280 healthy participants were considered. Viral

		  compounded by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-TB
		  co-infection and recent emergence of multidrug-resistant
		  (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB. In this
		  context, aspartokinase of mycobacterium tuberculosis has
		  drawn attention for designing novel anti-TB drugs. Asp
		  kinase is an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of
		  4-phospho-L-aspartate from L-aspartate and involved in the
		  branched biosynthetic pathway leading to the synthesis of
		  amino acids lysine, threonine, methionine and isoleucine.
		  An intermediate of lysine biosynthetic branch,
		  mesodiaminopimelate is also a component of the
		  peptidoglycan which is a component of bacterial cell wall.
		  To interfere with the production of all these amino acids
		  and cell wall, it is possible to inhibit Asp kinase
		  activity. This can be achieved using Asp kinase inhibitors.
		  In order to design novel Asp kinase inhibitors as effective
		  anti-TB drugs, it is necessary to have an understanding of
		  the binding sites of Asp kinase. As no crystal structure of
		  the enzyme has yet been published, we built a homology
		  model of Asp kinase using the crystallized Asp kinase from
		  M. Jannaschii, as template structures (2HMF and 3C1M).
		  After the molecular dynamics refinement, the optimized
		  homology model was assessed as a reliable structure by
		  PROCHECK, ERRAT, WHAT-IF, PROSA2003 and VERIFY-3D. The
		  results of molecular docking studies with natural
		  substrates, products and feedback inhibitors are in
		  agreement with the published data and showed that ACT
		  domain plays an important role in binding to ligands. Based
		  on the docking conformations, pharmacophore model can be
		  developed by probing the common features of ligands. By
		  analyzing the results, ACT domain architecture, certain key
		  residues that are responsible for binding to feedback
		  inhibitors and natural substrates were identified. This
		  would be very helpful in understanding the blockade
		  mechanism of Asp kinase and providing insights into
		  rational design of novel Asp kinase inhibitors for
		  M.tuberculosis.},

  abstract	= {Several molecules related to antigen presentation,
		  including gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and the major
		  histocompatibility complex (MHC), are encoded by
		  polymorphic genes. Some polymorphisms were found to affect
		  susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) when they were
		  considered singly in epidemiological studies, but how
		  multiple polymorphisms interact to determine susceptibility
		  to TB in an individual remains an open question. We
		  hypothesized that polymorphisms in some genes may
		  counteract or intensify the effects of polymorphisms in
		  other genes. For example, an increase in IFN-gamma
		  expression may counteract the weak binding that a
		  particular MHC variant displays for a peptide from
		  Mycobacterium tuberculosis to establish the same T-cell
		  response as another, more strongly binding MHC variant. To
		  test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model of
		  antigen presentation based on experimental data for the
		  known effects of genetic polymorphisms and simulated time
		  courses when multiple polymorphisms were present. We found
		  that polymorphisms in different genes could affect antigen
		  presentation to the same extent and therefore compensate
		  for each other. Furthermore, we defined the conditions
		  under which such relationships could exist. For example,
		  increased IFN-gamma expression compensated for decreased
		  peptide-MHC affinity in the model only above a certain
		  threshold of expression. Below this threshold, changes in
		  IFN-gamma expression were ineffectual compared to changes
		  in peptide-MHC affinity. The finding that polymorphisms
		  exhibit such relationships could explain discrepancies in
		  the epidemiological literature, where some polymorphisms
		  have been inconsistently associated with susceptibility to
		  TB. Furthermore, the model allows polymorphisms to be
		  ranked by effect, providing a new tool for designing

		  the cough-generated aerosol M. tuberculosis bacilli
		  concentration and particle size distribution. We found that
		  (i) the quantum generation rate of TB was estimated with a

		  geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 3.05 quantum/h at

		  that commercial passengers taking standard and nonreserved
		  cabins had higher transmission risk than those in business
		  cabins based on conservatism. Our results also reveal that
		  even a brief exposure, as in the bronchoscopy cases, can
		  also result in a transmission when the quantum generation
		  rate is high. This study could contribute to a better
		  understanding of the dynamics of TB transmission in

  abstract	= {In a population of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, random

		  anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs occurs at a relatively low
		  frequency. Anti-TB drugs impose selection pressure so that
		  mycobacterial mutants gradually outnumber susceptible
		  bacilli and emerge as the dominant strains. Resistance to
		  two or more anti-TB drugs represents cumulative results of
		  sequential mutation. The fourth report on global anti-TB
		  drug resistance provides the latest data on the extent of
		  such problem in the world. The median prevalence of
		  multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in new TB cases was 1.6\%,
		  and in previously treated TB cases 11.7\%. Of the half a
		  million MDR-TB cases estimated to have emerged in 2006,
		  50\% were in China and India. The optimal duration of any
		  given combination of anti-TB drugs for treatment of MDR-
		  and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has not been
		  defined in controlled clinical trials. Standardized
		  treatment may be feasible for MDR-TB patients not
		  previously treated with second-line drugs, but a different
		  strategy needs to be applied in the treatment of MDR-TB
		  patients who have received second-line drugs before.
		  Unfortunately, the reliability of drug susceptibility
		  testing of most second-line anti-TB drugs is still
		  questionable. Drug-resistant TB is not necessarily less
		  virulent. Findings from modelling exercise warned that if
		  MDR-TB case detection and treatment rates increase to the
		  World Health Organization target of 70\%, without
		  simultaneously increasing MDR-TB cure rates, XDR-TB
		  prevalence could increase exponentially. Prevention of
		  development of drug resistance must be accorded the top
		  priority in the era of MDR-/XDR-TB.},

  abstract	= {Here we present a review of the literature of influenza

		  strain of influenza A (H1N1), formerly known as swine flu.
		  We discuss how the feasibility of controlling an epidemic
		  critically depends on the value of the Basic Reproduction
		  Number (R0). The R0 for novel influenza A (H1N1) has
		  recently been estimated to be between 1.4 and 1.6. This
		  value is below values of R0 estimated for the 1918-1919
		  pandemic strain (mean R0 approximately 2: range 1.4 to 2.8)
		  and is comparable to R0 values estimated for seasonal
		  strains of influenza (mean R0 1.3: range 0.9 to 2.1). By
		  reviewing results from previous modeling studies we
		  conclude it is theoretically possible that a pandemic of
		  H1N1 could be contained. However it may not be feasible,
		  even in resource-rich countries, to achieve the necessary
		  levels of vaccination and treatment for control. As a
		  recent modeling study has shown, a global cooperative
		  strategy will be essential in order to control a pandemic.
		  This strategy will require resource-rich countries to share
		  their vaccines and antivirals with resource-constrained and
		  resource-poor countries. We conclude our review by
		  discussing the necessity of developing new biologically
		  complex models. We suggest that these models should
		  simultaneously track the transmission dynamics of multiple
		  strains of influenza in bird, pig and human populations.
		  Such models could be critical for identifying effective new
		  interventions, and informing pandemic preparedness
		  planning. Finally, we show that by modeling cross-species
		  transmission it may be possible to predict the emergence of
		  pandemic strains of influenza.},

		  tuberculosis (TB) disease by one of the three possible
		  routes: primary progression after a recent infection;
		  re-activation of a latent infection; or exogenous
		  re-infection of a previously infected individual. Recent
		  studies show that optimal TB control strategies may vary
		  depending on the predominant route to disease in a specific
		  population. It is therefore important for public health
		  policy makers to understand the relative frequency of each
		  type of TB within specific epidemiological scenarios.
		  Although molecular epidemiologic tools have been used to
		  estimate the relative contribution of recent transmission
		  and re-activation to the burden of TB disease, it is not
		  possible to use these techniques to distinguish between
		  primary disease and re-infection on a population level.
		  Current estimates of the contribution of re-infection
		  therefore rely on mathematical models which identify the
		  parameters most consistent with epidemiological data; these
		  studies find that exogenous re-infection is important only
		  when TB incidence is high. A basic assumption of these
		  models is that people in a population are all equally
		  likely to come into contact with an infectious case.
		  However, theoretical studies demonstrate that the social
		  and spatial structure can strongly influence the dynamics
		  of infectious disease transmission. Here, we use a network
		  model of TB transmission to evaluate the impact of
		  non-homogeneous mixing on the relative contribution of
		  re-infection over realistic epidemic trajectories. In
		  contrast to the findings of previous models, our results
		  suggest that re-infection may be important in communities
		  where the average disease incidence is moderate or low as
		  the force of infection can be unevenly distributed in the

		  recently in some areas of the Balkans region and Western
		  Europe, has raised a public alert toward the potential
		  occurrence of a new severe influenza pandemic. Here we
		  study the worldwide spread of a pandemic and its possible
		  containment at a global level taking into account all
		  available information on air travel.We studied a
		  metapopulation stochastic epidemic model on a global scale
		  that considers airline travel flow data among urban areas.
		  We provided a temporal and spatial evolution of the
		  pandemic with a sensitivity analysis of different levels of
		  infectiousness of the virus and initial outbreak conditions
		  (both geographical and seasonal). For each spreading
		  scenario we provided the timeline and the geographical
		  impact of the pandemic in 3,100 urban areas, located in 220
		  different countries. We compared the baseline cases with
		  different containment strategies, including travel
		  restrictions and the therapeutic use of antiviral (AV)
		  drugs. We investigated the effect of the use of AV drugs in
		  the event that therapeutic protocols can be carried out
		  with maximal coverage for the populations in all countries.
		  In view of the wide diversity of AV stockpiles in different
		  regions of the world, we also studied scenarios in which
		  only a limited number of countries are prepared (i.e., have
		  considerable AV supplies). In particular, we compared
		  different plans in which, on the one hand, only prepared
		  and wealthy countries benefit from large AV resources,
		  with, on the other hand, cooperative containment scenarios
		  in which countries with large AV stockpiles make a small
		  portion of their supplies available worldwide.We show that
		  the inclusion of air transportation is crucial in the
		  assessment of the occurrence probability of global
		  outbreaks. The large-scale therapeutic usage of AV drugs in
		  all hit countries would be able to mitigate a pandemic
		  effect with a reproductive rate as high as 1.9 during the
		  first year; with AV supply use sufficient to treat
		  approximately 2\% to 6\% of the population, in conjunction

		  For highly contagious viruses (i.e., a reproductive rate as
		  high as 2.3), even the unrealistic use of supplies
		  corresponding to the treatment of approximately 20\% of the
		  population leaves 30\%-50\% of the population infected. In

		  about the disease characteristics. An example of this is
		  represented by the number of H1N1 influenza cases in Mexico
		  during the first months of the current pandemic. Several
		  estimates using backtrack calculation based on imported
		  cases from Mexico in other countries point out that the
		  actual number of cases was likely orders of magnitude
		  larger than the number of confirmed cases. Realistic
		  computational models fed with the best available estimates
		  of the basic disease parameters can provide an ab-initio
		  calculation of the number of cases in Mexico as other
		  countries. Here we use the Global Epidemic and Mobility
		  (GLEaM) model to obtain estimates of the size of the
		  epidemic in Mexico as well as of imported cases at the end
		  of April and beginning of May. We find that the reference
		  range for the number of cases in Mexico on April 30th is
		  121,000 to 1,394,000 in good agreement with the recent
		  estimates by Lipsitch et al. [M. Lipsitch, PloS One 4:e6895
		  (2009)]. The number of imported cases from Mexico in
		  several countries is found to be in good agreement with the

		  when budget constraints exist. However, published cost and

		  seven strategies for reducing the burden of TB in countries
		  with high HIV prevalence. A compartmental difference
		  equation model of TB and HIV and recent cost data were used
		  to assess the costs (year 2003 USD prices) and effects (TB
		  cases averted, deaths averted, DALYs gained) of these
		  strategies in Kenya during the period 2004-2023.The three
		  lowest cost and most cost-effective strategies were
		  improving TB cure rates, improving TB case detection rates,
		  and improving both together. The incremental cost of
		  combined improvements to case detection and cure was below
		  USD 15 million per year (7.5\% of year 2000 government
		  health expenditure); the mean cost per DALY gained of these
		  three strategies ranged from USD 18 to USD 34.
		  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) had the highest incremental
		  costs, which by 2007 could be as large as total government
		  health expenditures in year 2000. ART could also gain more
		  DALYs than the other strategies, at a cost per DALY gained
		  of around USD 260 to USD 530. Both the costs and effects of
		  treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (TLTI) for HIV+
		  individuals were low; the cost per DALY gained ranged from
		  about USD 85 to USD 370. Averting one HIV infection for
		  less than USD 250 would be as cost-effective as improving
		  TB case detection and cure rates to WHO target levels.To
		  reduce the burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings,
		  the immediate goal should be to increase TB case detection
		  rates and, to the extent possible, improve TB cure rates,
		  preferably in combination. Realising the full potential of

		  resistance to four major anti-tuberculosis drugs

		  Using estimates of these two quantities together with other
		  published data, we reconstructed the epidemic spread of

		  median prevalence of resistance among new cases today was
		  7.0\% (range 0.9-64.3\%), close to the 6.3\% (range
		  0-28.1\%) observed. Predicted and observed prevalences of
		  resistance to isoniazid plus rifampicin
		  (multidrug-resistant or MDR-TB) after 30 years of combined
		  drug use were also similar, 0.9\% (0.1-5.9\%) and 1.0\%

		  MDR-TB will remain a localized problem, rather than
		  becoming a global obstacle to tuberculosis control. To

		  regional epidemics by pushing the outbreak into high
		  epidemic season. This important interaction between policy
		  and seasonality is only evident with a global-scale model.

		  1992, the Third World Congress on Tuberculosis concluded
		  that there was little recent information on the global
		  magnitude of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB),
		  defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin.
		  Through the WHO/IUATLD Global Project on Drug-Resistance
		  Surveillance launched in 1994, a large number of reliable
		  and accurate data have allowed us to understand the
		  magnitude of the problem of MDR-TB. The data available
		  suggest that globally MDR-TB is not a problem (median = 1\%
		  in 64 countries/geographical sites surveyed) of the same
		  magnitude as that of drug-susceptible tuberculosis.
		  However, MDR-TB is at critical levels in specific regions
		  of the world. Hot spots for MDR-TB include Estonia, Latvia,
		  the Oblasts of Ivanovo and Tomsk in Russia, and the
		  provinces of Henan and Zhejiang Provinces in China. Trends
		  confirm that MDR-TB is limited to local epidemics but the

		  possibly predict cholesterol levels given a certain dosing
		  regimen of statins and phytosterols/-stanols a more
		  theoretically based approach is helpful. This study aims to
		  construct a mathematical model to simulate reductions in
		  low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in persons who
		  combine the use of statins with a high intake of
		  phytosterols/-stanols, e.g. by the use of functional
		  foods.The proposed model includes the cholesterol pool size
		  in the liver and serum levels of very low-density
		  lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. Both an additional and a
		  multiplicative effect of phytosterol/-stanol intake on LDL
		  cholesterol reduction were predicted from the model. The
		  additional effect relates to the decrease of dietary
		  cholesterol uptake reduction, the multiplicative effect
		  relates to the decrease in enterohepatic recycling
		  efficiency, causing increased cholesterol elimination
		  through bile. From the model, it was demonstrated that a
		  daily intake of 2 g phytosterols/-stanols reduces LDL
		  cholesterol level by about 8\% to 9\% on top of the
		  reduction resulting from statin use. The additional
		  decrease in LDL cholesterol caused by phytosterol/-stanol
		  use at the recommended level of 2 g/d appeared to be
		  similar or even greater than the decrease achieved by
		  doubling the statin dose.We proposed a simplified
		  mathematical model to simulate the reduction in LDL
		  cholesterol after separate and combined intake of statins
		  and functional foods acting on intestinal (re)absorption of
		  cholesterol or bile acids in humans. In future work, this

  abstract	= {Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death globally. TB
		  had been considered conquered in Europe but has re-emerged
		  as a significant problem, partly because of poor TB control
		  programs and the link with HIV infection, migrants and
		  other vulnerable populations, but also because a mood of
		  complacency led to declining investment in research and
		  public health infrastructure. In the European Union (EU),
		  efforts initiated by the European Academies Science
		  Advisory Council (EASAC) now assess how research can better
		  inform policy development and indicate the gaps and
		  uncertainties in the scientific evidence base. A growing
		  number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains are now
		  resistant to the first-line anti-TB drugs, necessitating
		  use of second-line drugs which are more expensive, less
		  effective and more toxic. The presence of extensively
		  drug-resistant (XDR) TB in the EU illustrates that there
		  are problems with TB management and control. In the EU, the
		  aggregated rate of notified TB is approximately 18 cases
		  per 100,000 population (range 4-120 cases/100,000 in
		  different Member States). The highest rates are found in
		  Eastern European countries. Only about half of EU countries
		  routinely perform drug susceptibility testing linked to
		  notification of TB cases. It is important for the European
		  Commission (EC) to network regional reference laboratories
		  to support molecular epidemiology and exchange of data via
		  creation of interactive international databases of Mtb
		  genotypic and phenotypic information. EU countries should
		  help develop TB laboratory services by investing in
		  training and provision of assistance to maintain quality
		  control in neighbouring Eastern European countries.
		  Improved TB care necessitates research across the spectrum
		  to include fundamental and epidemiological science,
		  research and development (R&D) for new drugs, diagnostics,
		  vaccines, and operational research. Total R&D investment in
		  TB by the EC and Member States is low by comparison with
		  the USA despite Europe being on the frontline of the
		  epidemic. Thus, alternative funding models for targeting TB
		  research priorities by the EU are required. Increasing the
		  visibility of TB as a priority issue for the EU requires
		  the scientific community, with the academies of science, as
		  appropriate, to communicate to politicians, healthcare
		  providers, funders and the public at large about the
		  current threat posed by drug-resistant TB. Any global
		  strategy for TB control must also take into account
		  measures to address the social, environmental and economic
		  issues which are inextricably linked with TB. The academies
		  conclude that, overall, the EU has failed so far to respond
		  sufficiently to the global TB threat but can still draw on
		  considerable strengths in its science. The EU also has a
		  humanitarian responsibility to support TB control in
		  developing countries. It remains very important for the EC
		  that neither biomedical research nor investment in health
		  services should become a casualty of the current economic
		  recession.},

  abstract	= {Progress in understanding the biological processes that
		  allow Mycobacterium tuberculosis to be a successful
		  parasite have accelerated in the last twenty years. This
		  progress has been stimulated by the return of tuberculosis
		  (TB) as an important disease in industrialized countries,
		  by its increase in emergent nations in the tail of
		  population increases and poverty and by the spread of
		  multiple drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug
		  resistant (XDR) M. tuberculosis as a result of treatment
		  failures. Progress on M. tuberculosis biology has also been
		  fueled by advances in microbiology and molecular biology,
		  including molecular genetics, genomics, proteomics and in
		  vitro and in vivo models of infection. The study of latency
		  or dormancy, a phenomenon central to understanding the
		  persistence of M. tuberculosis and the development of TB in
		  individuals, its spread in human populations and the
		  emergence of antibiotic-resistant/tolerant organisms, has
		  been preferred targets for investigators in this area. In
		  this manner, factors that trigger M. tuberculosis latency
		  (e. g, hypoxia, nutrient starvation, NO exposure) have been
		  characterized and the metabolic shifts to host lipid
		  utilization, tolerance to antimicrobials and resistance to
		  host immune mechanisms involved in latency have been
		  determined. Similarly, genetic changes and the resulting
		  antimicrobial mechanisms mediating the MDR and XDR states
		  have been characterized and potential new vaccines that
		  avoid reactivation from latency and infection are being
		  developed. Despite this progress, and given the fact that
		  effective anti tuberculosis therapy was developed and first
		  introduced clinically at the end of the 1940s, there are
		  now more cases of latent and active TB worldwide than ever
		  before. This reinforces the concept of TB as a bacterial
		  disease with strong social and economical! determinants
		  which are presently stimulating increased transmission in
		  many human groups, undermining diagnostics, treatment and
		  prevention. It suggests that in a scenario of global
		  economical crisis the struggle against TB will be weakened,
		  unless efforts are included to alleviate poverty, decrease
		  economic inequality, improve public health and allow
		  democracy and political organization.},

  abstract	= {Following primary tuberculosis (TB) infection, only

		  people are assumed to mount an effective immune response to
		  the initial infection that limits proliferation of the
		  bacilli and leads to long-lasting partial immunity both to
		  further infection and to reactivation of latent bacilli
		  remaining from the original infection. Infected individuals
		  may develop active TB as a consequence of exogenous
		  reinfection, i.e., acquiring a new infection from another
		  infectious individual. Our results in this paper suggest
		  that exogenous reinfection has a drastic effect on the
		  qualitative dynamics of TB. The incorporation of exogenous
		  reinfection into our TB model allows the possibility of a
		  subcritical bifurcation at the critical value of the basic
		  reproductive number R(0)=1, and hence the existence of
		  multiple endemic equilibria for R(0)<1 and the exogenous
		  reinfection rate larger than a threshold. Our results
		  suggest that reducing R(0) to be smaller than one may not
		  be sufficient to eradicate the disease. An additional
		  reduction in reinfection rate may be required. These

		  effectiveness of most respirators is the leakage between

		  traditional fit testing of respirators does not adequately
		  predict the degree of protection in actual use, and more
		  research is needed in that area. There is a large range of
		  infectiousness of aerosols of TB, and classes of
		  respirators vary greatly in the degree of protection they
		  offer. I have argued that respirator selection should be
		  based on anticipated exposures. High-risk exposures to TB
		  are often associated with cough-inducing procedures or with
		  aerosolization of infected tissues during autopsies. In my
		  opinion, the most reasonable type of respirator for such

		  hood. The concentration of infectious aerosols in

		  very low, and the new N95 respirators offer a reasonable

  abstract	= {Regional differences in vaccination uptake are common in

		  linked to the availability of healthcare services and
		  socioeconomic factors. In 2007, 0.9 million eligible
		  Indonesian children missed measles vaccination, and 19 456
		  cases of measles were documented among Indonesian children.
		  The authors investigated rural-urban differentials in
		  measles vaccination coverage among young Indonesian
		  children, and sought to identify key factors influencing
		  the probability of a child receiving the first dose of
		  measles vaccination in Indonesia.Data used in the analyses
		  were sourced from the nationally representative Indonesia
		  Demographic and Health Survey 2007. The influence of
		  location of residence, household wealth, maternal and
		  paternal education, total children ever born and use of
		  skilled birth attendants on measles vaccination coverage
		  was investigated using bivariate analysis and chi-square
		  tests. The independent effects of these variables were
		  established using binomial logistic regression
		  analysis.Indonesia's 2007 first-dose measles national
		  vaccination coverage was, at 72.8\%, lower than the 2008
		  global first-dose measles vaccination average coverage of
		  82\%. Bivariate analysis revealed that the first-dose
		  measles vaccination coverage in rural areas of Indonesia
		  was 68.5\%, compared with 80.1\% in urban regions (p <
		  0.001). The apparent significance of rural residence in
		  impairing vaccination coverage was marginal after
		  controlling for the sex of the child, maternal age,
		  maternal and paternal education, wealth, and access to
		  skilled health workers.Apart from sustainable initiatives
		  to increase measles vaccination coverage globally, it is
		  important to close the rural-urban gap in Indonesia's
		  measles vaccination uptake. Addressing critical
		  determinants of inferior measles vaccination coverage in
		  Indonesia's rural regions will facilitate major
		  improvements in Indonesia's child health trends. This

		  transmission can sustain autonomous dynamics which may lead
		  to the next pandemic. Forecasts of influenza experts
		  usually rely on information related to new circulating

		  the effect of vaccination against the pandemic strain, if
		  available. Predictions are based on simulations from a
		  stochastic SEIR model. Parameters used in the simulations

		  seasonal constraints for a maximum value of the basic
		  reproductive number (R0, max) within a city equal to 1.5
		  and a mean generation interval (GI) of 2 days. In this case
		  and in the absence of vaccination, attack rates may reach

		  weeks postoperative bone surface volume fraction (BS/TV)
		  using rhBMP-2 was higher than with use of COLLOSS E and
		  autograft, while trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) was lower
		  using rhBMP-2 at this time-point. At eight weeks BS/TV and
		  trabecular number (Tb.N.) were still higher using rhBMP-2
		  than autograft and COLLOSS E. Connectivity density was
		  significantly higher using rhBMP-2 than using autograft or
		  COLLOSS E at both time-points. Between four- and eight-week
		  time-points BV/TV and Tb.Th. rose while Tb.N. declined
		  using rhBMP-2. The degree of anisotropy and the calculated
		  amount of trabeculae with main direction along the spinal
		  axis, were higher at four weeks using COLLOSS E. rhBMP-2
		  had the highest amount of trabeculae directed along the
		  spinal axis at eight weeks. A change in main direction
		  between four and eight weeks was observed for both
		  autograft and rhBMP-2. The numerical results from the
		  finite element model verify that significantly different
		  flow pattern emerges as the boundary conditions are
		  altered. At four weeks there was an evident correlation
		  between trabecular orientation and flow pattern using
		  rhBMP-2.This study reveals large differences in

		  mammalian metaphyseal trabecular bone is unevenly
		  distributed. Hence, defining a standard reference volume is
		  critical for morphometric analyses in metaphyseal sites.The
		  distal femoral and proximal tibial metaphyses of adult
		  orchietomized (ORX) or sham-ORX rats were scanned by
		  microCT 6 wk postoperatively. Morphometric analysis based
		  on 3D image data was performed in 450-microm-thick

		  to curve-fit analysis. A similar approach was used for

		  implants inserted horizontally 6 wk post-ORX and examined
		  2-12 wk after implantation.The respective curve-fit
		  analysis in both femur and tibia revealed decreasing

		  connectivity (Conn.D) densities, the magnitude of the ORX
		  effect vastly increased toward the diaphysis. The

		  The trabecular thickness showed a constant decrease in the

		  281 million individuals for R(0) (the basic reproductive
		  number) from 1.6 to 2.4. We model the impact that a variety

		  closure and travel restrictions) have on the timing and
		  magnitude of this spread. Our simulations demonstrate that,
		  in a highly mobile population, restricting travel after an
		  outbreak is detected is likely to delay slightly the time
		  course of the outbreak without impacting the eventual
		  number ill. For R(0) < 1.9, our model suggests that the
		  rapid production and distribution of vaccines, even if
		  poorly matched to circulating strains, could significantly
		  slow disease spread and limit the number ill to <10% of the
		  population, particularly if children are preferentially
		  vaccinated. Alternatively, the aggressive deployment of
		  several million courses of influenza antiviral agents in a
		  targeted prophylaxis strategy may contain a nascent
		  outbreak with low R(0), provided adequate contact tracing
		  and distribution capacities exist. For higher R(0), we
		  predict that multiple strategies in combination (involving
		  both social and medical interventions) will be required to
		  achieve similar limits on illness rates.},

		  Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease
		  Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to
		  the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk.
		  Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt,

		  to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie,

		  are inflated through a population phenomenon that occurs in
		  the presence of heterogeneity in individual risk of
		  infection. As a result, rates of reinfection are higher
		  when measured at the population level even though they

		  activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To optimize
		  moxifloxacin dose and dose regimen, pharmacodynamic
		  antibiotic-exposure targets associated with maximal
		  microbial kill and complete suppression of drug resistance
		  in M. tuberculosis must be identified.We used a novel in
		  vitro pharmacodynamic infection model of tuberculosis in
		  which we exposed M. tuberculosis to moxifloxacin with a
		  pharmacokinetic half-life of decline similar to that
		  encountered in humans. Data obtained from this model were
		  mathematically modeled, and the drug-exposure breakpoint
		  associated with the suppression of drug resistance was
		  determined. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to
		  determine the probability that 10,000 clinical patients
		  taking different doses of moxifloxacin would achieve or
		  exceed the drug-exposure breakpoint needed to suppress
		  resistance to moxifloxacin in M. tuberculosis.The ratio of
		  the moxifloxacin-free (non-protein-bound) area under the
		  concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h to the minimum
		  inhibitory concentration associated with complete
		  suppression of the drug-resistant mutant population was 53.
		  For patients taking moxifloxacin doses of 400, 600, or 800
		  mg/day, the calculated target-attainment rates to suppress
		  drug resistance were 59\%, 86\%, and 93\%, respectively.A
		  moxifloxacin dose of 800 mg/day is likely to achieve
		  excellent M. tuberculosis microbial kill and to suppress
		  drug resistance. However, tolerability of this higher dose

  abstract	= {The resurgence of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in
		  some parts of Europe and North America calls for a
		  mathematical study to assess the impact of the emergence
		  and spread of such strain on the global effort to
		  effectively control the burden of tuberculosis. This paper
		  presents a deterministic compartmental model for the
		  transmission dynamics of two strains of tuberculosis, a
		  drug-sensitive (wild) one and a multi-drug-resistant
		  strain. The model allows for the assessment of the
		  treatment of people infected with the wild strain. The
		  qualitative analysis of the model reveals the following.
		  The model has a disease-free equilibrium, which is locally
		  asymptotically stable if a certain threshold, known as the
		  effective reproduction number, is less than unity. Further,
		  the model undergoes a backward bifurcation, where the
		  disease-free equilibrium coexists with a stable endemic
		  equilibrium. One of the main novelties of this study is the
		  numerical illustration of tri-stable equilibria, where the
		  disease-free equilibrium coexists with two stable endemic
		  equilibrium when the aforementioned threshold is less than
		  unity, and a bi-stable setup, involving two stable endemic
		  equilibria, when the effective reproduction number is
		  greater than one. This, to our knowledge, is the first time
		  such dynamical features have been observed in TB dynamics.
		  Finally, it is shown that the backward bifurcation
		  phenomenon in this model arises due to the exogenous
		  re-infection property of tuberculosis.},

		  Sensitivity analysis techniques, together with extensive

		  Factor-[Formula: see text] (TNF) during primary infection;
		  ii) production of TNF, but not of interferon-[Formula: see

  abstract	= {Despite numerous intervention strategies, including the
		  direct observed short-course treatment strategy and
		  improved diagnostic methods, the incidence of
		  multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant
		  tuberculosis (TB) continues to rise globally. Many
		  treatment policies are based on the model that acquisition
		  of drug resistance in already infected individuals drives
		  the drug-resistant TB epidemic, hence the focus on
		  drug-resistance testing of retreatment cases. However,
		  molecular epidemiology and mathematical modeling suggest
		  that the majority of multidrug-resistant TB cases are due
		  to ongoing transmission of multidrug-resistant strains.
		  This is most likely the result of diagnostic delay, thereby
		  emphasizing the need for rapid diagnostics and
		  comprehensive contact tracing, as well as active case
		  finding. Current diagnosis of TB in low-income, high-burden
		  regions relies on smear microscopy and clinical signs and
		  symptoms. However, this smear-centered approach has many
		  pitfalls, including low sensitivity in HIV patients and
		  children, the inability of smear to reveal drug-resistance
		  patterns, and the need for sampling on consecutive days. In
		  order to address these limitations, efforts have been made
		  to expand access to Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture and
		  drug susceptibility testing. However, the slow growth rate
		  of the causative agent, M. tuberculosis, contributes to
		  significant diagnostic delay. Molecular-based diagnostic
		  methods, targeting mutations that are known to confirm drug
		  resistance, are capable of significantly reducing
		  diagnostic delay. Two such methods, the line-probe assay
		  and the real-time PCR-based Xpert® MTB/RIF assay, have
		  been described. The latter test shows particular promise
		  for smear-negative and extrapulmonary specimens. This may
		  prove especially useful in settings where co-infection
		  rates with HIV are high. However, since most research
		  focuses on the performance of both of these assays, further
		  investigations need to be done regarding the impact of the
		  routine implementation of these assays on TB control
		  programs and the cost effectiveness thereof.},

  abstract	= {Although the prevalence of tuberculosis continues to
		  decline in most developed countries, the risk of
		  healthcare-associated tuberculosis, remains for patients or
		  healthcare staff. Outbreaks of healthcare-associated
		  tuberculosis are usually associated with delays in
		  diagnosis and treatment, or the care of patients in
		  sub-optimal facilities. The control and prevention of
		  tuberculosis in hospitals is best achieved by three
		  approaches, namely administrative (early investigation
		  diagnosis, etc.), engineering (physical facilities e.g.
		  ventilated isolation rooms) and personal respiratory
		  protection (face sealing masks which are filtered). Recent
		  guidelines on the prevention of tuberculosis in healthcare
		  facilities from Europe and the USA have many common themes.
		  In the UK, however, negative pressure isolation rooms are
		  recommended only for patients with suspected multi-drug
		  resistant TB and personal respiratory protection, i.e.
		  filtered masks, are not considered necessary unless
		  multi-drug resistant TB is suspected, or where
		  aerosol-generating procedures are likely. In the US, the
		  standard of care for patients with infectious tuberculosis
		  is a negative pressure ventilated room and the use of
		  personal respiratory protection for all healthcare workers
		  entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed
		  tuberculosis. The absence of clinical trials in this area
		  precludes dogmatic recommendations. Nonetheless,
		  observational studies and mathematical modelling suggest
		  that all measures are required for effective prevention.
		  Even when policies and facilities are optimal, there is a
		  need to regularly review and audit these as sometimes
		  compliance is less than optimal. The differences in
		  recommendations may reflect the variations in epidemiology
		  and the greater use of BCG vaccination in the UK compared
		  with the United States. There is a strong argument for
		  advising ventilated facilities and personal respiratory
		  protection for the care of all patients with tuberculosis,
		  as multi-drug tuberculosis may not always be apparent on
		  admission, and these measures minimise transmission of all
		  cases of TB to other patients and healthcare staff.},

		  hierarchical cluster detection tests commonly used in
		  multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) analyses as
		  considerable random error can occur. Therefore, when MDRTB
		  clusters are spatially autocorrelated the assumption that
		  the clusters are independently random is invalid. In this
		  research, a product moment correlation coefficient (i.e.,
		  the Moran's coefficient) was used to quantify local spatial
		  variation in multiple clinical and environmental predictor
		  variables sampled in San Juan de Lurigancho, Lima, Peru.
		  Initially, QuickBird 0.61 m data, encompassing visible
		  bands and the near infra-red bands, were selected to
		  synthesize images of land cover attributes of the study
		  site. Data of residential addresses of individual patients
		  with smear-positive MDR-TB were geocoded, prevalence rates
		  calculated and then digitally overlaid onto the satellite
		  data within a 2 km buffer of 31 georeferenced health
		  centers, using a 10 m2 grid-based algorithm. Geographical
		  information system (GIS)-gridded measurements of each
		  health center were generated based on preliminary base maps
		  of the georeferenced data aggregated to block groups and
		  census tracts within each buffered area. A
		  three-dimensional model of the study site was constructed
		  based on a digital elevation model (DEM) to determine
		  terrain covariates associated with the sampled MDR-TB
		  covariates. Pearson's correlation was used to evaluate the
		  linear relationship between the DEM and the sampled MDR-TB
		  data. A SAS/GIS(R) module was then used to calculate
		  univariate statistics and to perform linear and non-linear
		  regression analyses using the sampled predictor variables.
		  The estimates generated from a global autocorrelation
		  analyses were then spatially decomposed into empirical
		  orthogonal bases using a negative binomial regression with
		  a non-homogeneous mean. Results of the DEM analyses
		  indicated a statistically non-significant, linear
		  relationship between georeferenced health centers and the
		  sampled covariate elevation. The data exhibited positive
		  spatial autocorrelation and the decomposition of Moran's
		  coefficient into uncorrelated, orthogonal map pattern
		  components revealed global spatial heterogeneities
		  necessary to capture latent autocorrelation in the MDR-TB
		  model. It was thus shown that Poisson regression analyses
		  and spatial eigenvector mapping can elucidate the mechanics
		  of MDR-TB transmission by prioritizing clinical and
		  environmental-sampled predictor variables for identifying
		  high risk populations.},

		  the number of doses received by children listed in the
		  database who had paralysis that was not caused by
		  poliovirus.The estimated efficacies per dose of monovalent
		  type 1 oral poliovirus vaccine and trivalent oral
		  poliovirus vaccine against type 1 paralytic poliomyelitis

		  efficacy per dose of trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine
		  against type 3 paralytic poliomyelitis was 18\% (95\% CI, 9
		  to 26). In the northwestern region of Nigeria, which
		  reported the majority of cases during the study period,
		  coverage with at least one dose of vaccine increased from
		  59 to 78\%. Between 2005 and 2007, vaccine-induced immunity
		  levels among children under the age of 5 years more than
		  doubled, to 56\%.The higher efficacy of monovalent type 1
		  oral poliovirus vaccine (four times as effective as
		  trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine) and the moderate gains
		  in coverage dramatically increased vaccine-induced immunity

		  provides a unique opportunity to analyze the pathogenicity
		  of the virus, the clinical severity of the disease, and the
		  effectiveness of control measures for cVDPVs as compared
		  with wild-type poliovirus (WPV).We identified cases of
		  acute flaccid paralysis associated with fecal excretion of
		  type 2 cVDPV, type 1 WPV, or type 3 WPV reported in Nigeria
		  through routine surveillance from January 1, 2005, through
		  June 30, 2009. The clinical characteristics of these cases,
		  the clinical attack rates for each virus, and the
		  effectiveness of oral polio vaccines in preventing
		  paralysis from each virus were compared.No significant
		  differences were found in the clinical severity of
		  paralysis among the 278 cases of type 2 cVDPV, the 2323
		  cases of type 1 WPV, and the 1059 cases of type 3 WPV. The
		  estimated average annual clinical attack rates of type 1
		  WPV, type 2 cVDPV, and type 3 WPV per 100,000 susceptible
		  children under 5 years of age were 6.8 (95\% confidence

		  4.0 (95\% CI, 3.4 to 4.7), respectively. The estimated
		  effectiveness of trivalent oral polio vaccine against
		  paralysis from type 2 cVDPV was 38\% (95\% CI, 15 to 54\%)
		  per dose, which was substantially higher than that against
		  paralysis from type 1 WPV (13\%; 95\% CI, 8 to 18\%), or
		  type 3 WPV (20\%; 95\% CI, 12 to 26\%). The more frequent
		  use of serotype 1 and serotype 3 monovalent oral polio
		  vaccines has resulted in improvements in vaccine-induced
		  population immunity against these serotypes and in declines
		  in immunity to type 2 cVDPV.The attack rate and severity of
		  disease associated with the recent cVDPV identified in
		  Nigeria are similar to those associated with WPV.
		  International planning for the management of the risk of

		  anti-vaccination information. This paper builds upon
		  previous research by analyzing the arguments proffered on

		  safety and effectiveness, alternative medicine, civil
		  liberties, conspiracy theories, and morality were found on
		  the majority of websites analyzed; misinformation was also
		  prevalent. The most commonly proposed method of combating
		  this misinformation is through better education, although
		  this has proven ineffective. Education does not consider
		  the discourses supporting vaccine rejection, such as those
		  involving alternative explanatory models of health,
		  interpretations of parental responsibility, and distrust of
		  expertise. Anti-vaccination protestors make postmodern
		  arguments that reject biomedical and scientific "facts" in
		  favour of their own interpretations. Pro-vaccination
		  advocates who focus on correcting misinformation reduce the
		  controversy to merely an "educational" problem; rather,
		  these postmodern discourses must be acknowledged in order

		  Importation of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and

		  survey information on social encounters from over 5800
		  respondents is coupled to predictive models of contact
		  tracing and control. This is used to investigate the likely
		  efficacy of contact tracing and the distribution of
		  secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent

		  effective contact tracing less than 1 in 6 cases will

		  comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36
		  individuals traced per case. Changes to the definition of a
		  close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased
		  risk of untraced cases; we find that tracing using a
		  contact definition requiring more than 4 hours of contact
		  is unlikely to control spread. The current contact tracing
		  strategy within the UK is likely to identify a sufficient
		  proportion of infected individuals such that subsequent
		  spread could be prevented, although the ultimate success
		  will depend on the rapid detection of cases and isolation
		  of contacts. Given the burden of tracing a large number of
		  contacts to find new cases, there is the potential the
		  system could be overwhelmed if imports of infection occur

		  drug resistant (XDR) tuberculosis around the world,
		  including in industrialized nations, poses a great threat
		  to human health and defines a need to develop new,
		  effective and inexpensive anti-tubercular agents.
		  Previously we developed a chemical systems biology approach
		  to identify off-targets of major pharmaceuticals on a
		  proteome-wide scale. In this paper we further demonstrate
		  the value of this approach through the discovery that
		  existing commercially available drugs, prescribed for the
		  treatment of Parkinson's disease, have the potential to
		  treat MDR and XDR tuberculosis. These drugs, entacapone and
		  tolcapone, are predicted to bind to the enzyme InhA and
		  directly inhibit substrate binding. The prediction is
		  validated by in vitro and InhA kinetic assays using tablets
		  of Comtan, whose active component is entacapone. The
		  minimal inhibition concentration (MIC(99)) of entacapone
		  for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tuberculosis) is
		  approximately 260.0 microM, well below the toxicity
		  concentration determined by an in vitro cytotoxicity model
		  using a human neuroblastoma cell line. Moreover, kinetic
		  assays indicate that Comtan inhibits InhA activity by
		  47.0\% at an entacapone concentration of approximately 80
		  microM. Thus the active component in Comtan represents a
		  promising lead compound for developing a new class of
		  anti-tubercular therapeutics with excellent safety
		  profiles. More generally, the protocol described in this
		  paper can be included in a drug discovery pipeline in an
		  effort to discover novel drug leads with desired safety
		  profiles, and therefore accelerate the development of new
		  drugs.},

		  vaccines augmented in vivo differentiation of CTL against
		  TB. We measured the amount of Ksp37 protein in human serum
		  and revealed that the level of Ksp37 protein of patients
		  with tuberculosis was lower than that of healthy
		  volunteers. Therefore, we established Ksp37 transgenic mice
		  as well as granulysin transgenic mice to elucidate the
		  function of those proteins. Both transgenic mice were
		  resistant to TB infection. Conclusion: These data indicate
		  the potential of combinational therapy; the combination of
		  two DNA vaccines or combination of DNA vaccine with
		  antibiotic drug. Thus, it will provide a novel strategy for

  abstract	= {We present a combined epidemiological and economic model
		  for control of diseases spreading on local and small-world
		  networks. The disease is characterized by a pre-symptomatic
		  infectious stage that makes detection and control of cases
		  more difficult. The effectiveness of local
		  (ring-vaccination or culling) and global control strategies
		  is analysed by comparing the net present values of the
		  combined cost of preventive treatment and illness. The
		  optimal strategy is then selected by minimizing the total
		  cost of the epidemic. We show that three main strategies
		  emerge, with treating a large number of individuals (global
		  strategy, GS), treating a small number of individuals in a
		  well-defined neighbourhood of a detected case (local
		  strategy) and allowing the disease to spread unchecked
		  (null strategy, NS). The choice of the optimal strategy is
		  governed mainly by a relative cost of palliative and
		  preventive treatments. If the disease spreads within the
		  well-defined neighbourhood, the local strategy is optimal
		  unless the cost of a single vaccine is much higher than the
		  cost associated with hospitalization. In the latter case,
		  it is most cost-effective to refrain from prevention.
		  Destruction of local correlations, either by long-range
		  (small-world) links or by inclusion of many initial foci,
		  expands the range of costs for which the NS is most
		  cost-effective. The GS emerges for the case when the cost
		  of prevention is much lower than the cost of treatment and
		  there is a substantial non-local component in the disease
		  spread. We also show that local treatment is only desirable
		  if the disease spreads on a small-world network with
		  sufficiently few long-range links; otherwise it is optimal
		  to treat globally. In the mean-field case, there are only
		  two optimal solutions, to treat all if the cost of the
		  vaccine is low and to treat nobody if it is high. The basic
		  reproduction ratio, R(0), does not depend on the rate of
		  responsive treatment in this case and the disease always
		  invades (but might be stopped afterwards). The details of
		  the local control strategy, and in particular the optimal
		  size of the control neighbourhood, are determined by the
		  epidemiology of the disease. The properties of the pathogen
		  might not be known in advance for emerging diseases, but
		  the broad choice of the strategy can be made based on
		  economic analysis only.},

		  use dynamic epidemiological models embedded in a

		  strategy. We find that countries can achieve significantly

		  whole-genome sequencing of a collection of 66 clinical MDR
		  isolates, along with 31 drug-susceptible isolates, that
		  were isolated in Panama between 2001 and 2010; 78\% of the

		  (LAM) family. Drug resistance mutations correlated well

		  the acquisition of resistance mutations, a phylogenetic
		  tree was constructed based on a genome-wide
		  single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis. The phylogenetic
		  tree shows that the isolates are highly clustered, with a
		  single strain (LAM9-c1) accounting for nearly one-half of
		  the MDR isolates (29/66 isolates). The LAM9-c1 strain was
		  most prevalent among male patients of working age and was

		  to isoniazid (KatG S315T mutation), rifampin (RpoB S531L
		  mutation), and streptomycin (rrs C517T mutation). This

		  MDR-TB in Panama is driven by clonal expansion and ongoing
		  transmission of several strains in the LAM family,
		  including the highly successful MDR strain LAM9-c1. The
		  phylogenetic analysis also shows that the LAM9-c1 strain is
		  closely related to the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) extensively
		  drug-resistant TB strain identified in KwaZulu-Natal, South
		  Africa. The LAM9-c1 and KZN strains likely arose from a

		  simulate the TB dynamics in prison and evaluate the
		  potential impact on active TB prevalence of several
		  intervention strategies. The TB dynamics with the ongoing
		  program was simulated over a 10 year period in a Rio de
		  Janeiro prison (TB prevalence 4.6 \%). Then, a simulation
		  of the DOTS strategy reaching the objective of 70 \% of
		  bacteriologically-positive cases detected and 85 \% of

		  only to 2.8\% the average predicted TB prevalence after 5
		  years. Adding TB detection at entry point to DOTS strategy
		  had no major effect on the predicted active TB prevalence.
		  But, adding further a yearly X-ray mass screening of
		  inmates reduced the predicted active TB prevalence below
		  1\%. Furthermore, according to this model, after applying
		  this strategy during 2 years (three annual screenings), the
		  TB burden would be reduced and the active TB prevalence
		  could be kept at a low level by associating X-ray screening
		  at entry point and DOTS.We have shown that X-ray mass

		  use stochastic epidemic simulations to investigate the

		  prophylactically. The authors compare targeted antiviral
		  prophylaxis with vaccination strategies. They model an

		  similar to influenza A virus (H2N2) that caused the Asian
		  influenza pandemic of 1957-1958. In the absence of

		  and a death rate of 0.04 deaths/1,000 persons (95% CI:

		  a set of genes, known as the dormancy regulon, in vivo.
		  These genes are expressed in vitro in response to nitric

		  During infection it is not known whether the organism is in

		  non-replicating state, with the latter ultimately causing a
		  latent infection with the potential to reactivate to active
		  disease. We collected gene expression data for Mtb bacilli

		  magnetic resonance (MR) imaging combined with image
		  analysis to investigate the three-dimensional (3D)
		  trabecular structure, anisotropy, and connectivity of human
		  vertebral, femoral, and calcaneal specimens. The goal was
		  to determine whether: (a) MR-derived measures depict known
		  skeletal-site-specific differences in architecture and
		  orientation of trabeculae; (b) 3D architectural parameters
		  combined with bone mineral density (BMD) improve the
		  prediction of the elastic modulus using a fabric tensor
		  formulation; (c) MR-derived 3D architectural parameters
		  combined with BMD improve the prediction of strength using
		  a multiple regression model, and whether these results
		  corresponded to the results obtained using higher
		  resolution depictions of trabecular architecture. A total
		  of 94 specimens (12 x 12 x 12 mm cubes) consisting of
		  trabecular bone only were obtained, of which there were 7
		  from the calcaneus, 15 from distal femur, 47 from the
		  proximal femur, and 25 from the vertebral bodies. MR images
		  were obtained using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner at a spatial
		  resolution of 117 x 117 x 300 microm. Additionally, BMD was
		  determined using quantitative computed tomography (QCT),
		  and the specimens were nondestructively tested and the
		  elastic modulus (YM) was measured along three orthogonal
		  axes corresponding to the anatomic superior-inferior
		  (axial), medial-lateral (sagittal), and anterior-posterior
		  (coronal) directions. A subset of the specimens (n=67) was
		  then destructively tested in the superior-inferior (axial)
		  direction to measure the ultimate compressive strength. The
		  MR images were segmented into bone and marrow phases and
		  then analyzed in 3D. Ellipsoids were fitted to the mean
		  intercept lengths, using single value decomposition and the
		  primary orientation of the trabeculae and used to calculate
		  the anisotropy of trabecular architecture. Stereological
		  measures were derived using a previously developed model
		  and measures such as mean trabecular width, spacing, and
		  number were derived. Because the spatial resolution of MR
		  images is comparable to trabecular bone dimensions, these
		  measures may be subject to partial volume effects and were
		  thus treated as apparent measures, such as BV/TV, Tb.Sp,
		  Tb.N, and Tb.Th rather than absolute measures, as would be
		  derived from histomorphometry. In addition, in a subset of
		  specimens, the Euler number per unit volume was determined
		  to characterize the connectivity of the trabecular network.
		  There were significant differences in the BMD, trabecular
		  architectural measures, elastic modulus, and strength at
		  the different skeletal sites. The primary orientation axes
		  for most of the specimens was the anatomic
		  superior-inferior (axial) direction. Using the fabric
		  tensor formulation, in addition to BMD, improved the
		  prediction of YM (SI), while including some of the
		  architectural parameters significantly improved the
		  prediction of strength. In comparing MR-derived 3D measures
		  with those obtained from 20 microm optical images (n=18; 9
		  vertebrae, 9 femur specimens), good correlations were found
		  for the apparent Tb.Sp and Tb.N, moderate correlation was
		  seen for the apparent BV/TV, and poor correlation was found
		  for the apparent Tb.Th. Using these higher resolution
		  images, the fabric tensor formulation for predicting the
		  elastic modulus also showed improved correlation between
		  the measured and calculated modulus in the axial (SI)
		  direction. In summary, high-resolution MR images may be
		  used to assess 3D architecture of trabecular bone, and the
		  inclusion of some of the 3D architectural measures provides
		  an improved assessment of biomechanical properties. Further
		  studies are clearly warranted to establish the role of
		  architecture in predicting overall bone quality, and the
		  role of trabecular architecture measures in clinical
		  practice. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

		  that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays a major role in host
		  defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of
		  infection. TNF-neutralizing drugs used to treat
		  inflammatory disorders have been reported to increase the
		  risk of tuberculosis (TB), in accordance with animal
		  studies. The present study takes a computational approach
		  toward characterizing the role of TNF in protection against
		  the tubercle bacillus in both active and latent infection.
		  We extend our previous mathematical models to investigate
		  the roles and production of soluble (sTNF) and
		  transmembrane TNF (tmTNF). We analyze effects of anti-TNF
		  therapy in virtual clinical trials (VCTs) by simulating two
		  of the most commonly used therapies, anti-TNF antibody and
		  TNF receptor fusion, predicting mechanisms that explain

		  following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor for
		  causing reactivation of latent infection and that
		  sTNF--even at very low levels--is essential for control of
		  infection. Using a mathematical model, it is possible to

  abstract	= {With new cases of avian influenza H5N1 (H5N1AV) arising
		  frequently, the threat of a new influenza pandemic remains
		  a challenge for public health. Several vaccines have been
		  developed specifically targeting H5N1AV, but their
		  production is limited and only a few million doses are
		  readily available. Because there is an important time lag
		  between the emergence of new pandemic strain and the
		  development and distribution of a vaccine, shortage of
		  vaccine is very likely at the beginning of a pandemic. We
		  coupled a mathematical model with a genetic algorithm to
		  optimally and dynamically distribute vaccine in a network
		  of cities, connected by the airline transportation network.
		  By minimizing the illness attack rate (i.e., the percentage
		  of people in the population who become infected and ill),
		  we focus on optimizing vaccine allocation in a network of
		  16 cities in Southeast Asia when only a few million doses
		  are available. In our base case, we assume the vaccine is
		  well-matched and vaccination occurs 5 to 10 days after the
		  beginning of the epidemic. The effectiveness of all the
		  vaccination strategies drops off as the timing is delayed
		  or the vaccine is less well-matched. Under the best
		  assumptions, optimal vaccination strategies substantially
		  reduced the illness attack rate, with a maximal reduction

  abstract	= {Polio eradication is on the cusp of success, with only a
		  few regions still maintaining transmission. Improving our
		  understanding of why some regions have been successful and
		  others have not will help with both global eradication of
		  polio and development of more effective vaccination
		  strategies for other pathogens. To examine the past 25
		  years of eradication efforts, we constructed a transmission
		  model for wild poliovirus that incorporates waning immunity
		  (which affects both infection risk and transmissibility of
		  any resulting infection), age-mediated vaccination rates,
		  and transmission of oral polio vaccine. The model produces
		  results consistent with the 4 country categories defined by
		  the Global Polio Eradication Program: elimination with no
		  subsequent outbreaks; elimination with subsequent transient
		  outbreaks; elimination with subsequent outbreaks and
		  transmission detected for more than 12 months; and endemic
		  polio transmission. Analysis of waning immunity rates and
		  oral polio vaccine transmissibility reveals that higher
		  waning immunity rates make eradication more difficult
		  because of increasing numbers of infectious adults, and
		  that higher oral polio vaccine transmission rates make
		  eradication easier as adults become reimmunized. Given
		  these dynamic properties, attention should be given to
		  intervention strategies that complement childhood
		  vaccination. For example, improvement in sanitation can
		  reduce the reproduction number in problematic regions, and
		  adult vaccination can lower adult transmission.},

		  logistic growth with a spatially varying background
		  carrying capacity and the flow dynamics are generated using
		  the two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations. We
		  characterize the system in terms of a dimensionless
		  parameter, gamma identical with TB/TF, which is the ratio
		  of the ecosystem biological time scales TB and the flow
		  time scales TF. We integrate this system numerically for
		  different values of gamma until the mean plankton reaches a
		  statistically stationary state and examine how the
		  steady-state mean and variance of plankton depends on
		  gamma. Overall we find that advection in the presence of a
		  nonuniform background carrying capacity can lead to very
		  different plankton distributions depending on the time
		  scale ratio gamma. For small gamma the plankton
		  distribution is very similar to the background carrying
		  capacity field and has a mean concentration close to the
		  mean carrying capacity. As gamma increases the plankton
		  concentration is more influenced by the advection
		  processes. In the largest gamma cases there is a
		  homogenization of the plankton concentration and the mean
		  plankton concentration approaches the harmonic mean,
		  <1/K>(-1). We derive asymptotic approximations for the
		  cases of small and large gamma. We also look at the
		  dependence of the power spectra exponent, beta, on gamma
		  where the power spectrum of plankton is proportional to
		  k(-beta). We find that the power spectra exponent closely
		  obeys beta=1+2/gamma as predicted by earlier studies using
		  simple models of chaotic advection.},

		  Health Organization recommends Xpert for initial diagnosis
		  in individuals suspected of having multidrug-resistant TB
		  (MDR-TB) or HIV-associated TB, and many countries are
		  moving quickly toward adopting Xpert. As roll-out proceeds,
		  it is essential to understand the potential health impact
		  and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies based on
		  Xpert.We evaluated potential health and economic
		  consequences of implementing Xpert in five southern African
		  countries--Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and
		  Swaziland--where drug resistance and TB-HIV coinfection are
		  prevalent. Using a calibrated, dynamic mathematical model,
		  we compared the status quo diagnostic algorithm,
		  emphasizing sputum smear, against an algorithm
		  incorporating Xpert for initial diagnosis. Results were
		  projected over 10- and 20-y time periods starting from
		  2012. Compared to status quo, implementation of Xpert would
		  avert 132,000 (95\% CI: 55,000-284,000) TB cases and
		  182,000 (97,000-302,000) TB deaths in southern Africa over
		  the 10 y following introduction, and would reduce
		  prevalence by 28\% (14\%-40\%) by 2022, with more modest
		  reductions in incidence. Health system costs are projected
		  to increase substantially with Xpert, by US$460 million
		  (294-699 million) over 10 y. Antiretroviral therapy for HIV
		  represents a substantial fraction of these additional
		  costs, because of improved survival in TB/HIV-infected
		  populations through better TB case-finding and treatment.
		  Costs for treating MDR-TB are also expected to rise
		  significantly with Xpert scale-up. Relative to status quo,
		  Xpert has an estimated cost-effectiveness of US$959
		  (633-1,485) per disability-adjusted life-year averted over
		  10 y. Across countries, cost-effectiveness ratios ranged
		  from US$792 (482-1,785) in Swaziland to US$1,257
		  (767-2,276) in Botswana. Assessing outcomes over a 10-y
		  period focuses on the near-term consequences of Xpert
		  adoption, but the cost-effectiveness results are
		  conservative, with cost-effectiveness ratios assessed over
		  a 20-y time horizon approximately 20\% lower than the 10-y
		  values.Introduction of Xpert could substantially change TB
		  morbidity and mortality through improved case-finding and
		  treatment, with more limited impact on long-term
		  transmission dynamics. Despite extant uncertainty about TB
		  natural history and intervention impact in southern Africa,
		  adoption of Xpert evidently offers reasonable value for its
		  cost, based on conventional benchmarks for
		  cost-effectiveness. However, the additional financial
		  burden would be substantial, including significant
		  increases in costs for treating HIV and MDR-TB. Given the
		  fundamental influence of HIV on TB dynamics and
		  intervention costs, care should be taken when interpreting
		  the results of this analysis outside of settings with high
		  HIV prevalence.},

		  highly present pandemic and often terminal. This is also
		  due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains
		  (MDR-TB and XDR-TB) of the primary causative TB agent
		  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Efforts to develop new
		  effective drugs against MTB are restrained by the unique
		  and largely impermeable composition of the mycobacterial
		  cell wall.Based on a database of antimycobacterial
		  substances (CDD TB), 3815 compounds were classified as
		  active and thus permeable. A data mining approach was
		  conducted to gather the physico-chemical similarities of
		  these substances and delimit them from a generic dataset of
		  drug-like molecules. On the basis of the differences in
		  these datasets, a regression model was generated and
		  implemented into the online tool MycPermCheck to predict
		  the permeability probability of small organic compounds.
		  Discussion: Given the current lack of precise molecular
		  criteria determining mycobacterial permeability,
		  MycPermCheck represents an unprecedented prediction tool
		  intended to support antimycobacterial drug discovery. It
		  follows a novel knowledge-driven approach to estimate the
		  permeability probability of small organic compounds. As
		  such, MycPermCheck can be used intuitively as an additional

		  swine, and to evaluate the effect of placental efficiency
		  on litter size. The selection index (SI) included total
		  born (TB), birth weight (BRWT), and placental weight (PW),
		  and was designed to increase in the high line (H) or
		  decrease in the low line (L) the efficiency of the
		  placental function (PE), defined as the ratio BRWT:PW.
		  (Co)variance components were estimated for direct and
		  maternal additive effects by using an animal model with
		  MTDFREML procedures. Estimated breeding values were
		  calculated by using records on individual BRWT (n = 2,111),
		  PW (n = 2,006), PE (n = 1,677), and SI (n = 1,677). Litter
		  traits were evaluated using records on 193 litters. The
		  model included the fixed effects of contemporary group for
		  all traits, with the addition of sex for individual traits
		  and parity for litter traits. Litter was fitted as an
		  uncorrelated random effect for all traits, and TB was used
		  as a linear and quadratic covariate for BRWT, PW, and PE.
		  Direct heritability estimates from single-trait models were
		  0.03, 0.25, 0.18, 0.11, and 0.08 for BRWT, PW, PE, SI, and
		  TB, respectively. Estimated breeding values were compared
		  between lines by using a model including generation, line
		  within generation, and replicate within line as the error
		  term. Estimates of genetic divergence were 20.7 +/- 2.7 g,
		  0.24 +/- 0.03, 0.11 +/- 0.02, and 0.07 +/- 0.02 per
		  generation for PW, PE, SI, and TB, respectively (P < 0.01),
		  but divergence was not significant for BRWT. At Generation
		  4, direct EBV was higher in L than in H for PW (55.9 +/-
		  8.7 vs. -24.2 +/- 9.5 g, respectively; P < 0.01) and higher
		  in H than in L for PE (0.58 +/- 0.10 vs. -0.35 +/- 0.09 g,
		  respectively; P < 0.01). However, EBV was not different for
		  BRWT, SI, or TB. These results indicate that PW and PE are
		  susceptible to change by genetic selection; however, the
		  correlated response in TB was an unexpected genetic trend
		  toward a higher TB in L of 0.05 +/- 0.01 piglets per
		  generation (P < 0.01).},

  abstract	= {Rubella is generally a mild childhood disease, but
		  infection during early pregnancy may cause spontaneous
		  abortion or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which may
		  entail a variety of birth defects. Since vaccination at
		  levels short of those necessary to achieve eradication may
		  increase the average age of infection, and thus potentially
		  the CRS burden, introduction of the vaccine has been
		  limited to contexts where coverage is high. Recent work
		  suggests that spatial heterogeneity in coverage should also
		  be a focus of concern. Here, we use a detailed dataset from
		  South Africa to explore the implications of heterogeneous
		  vaccination for the burden of CRS, introducing realistic
		  vaccination scenarios based on reported levels of measles
		  vaccine coverage. Our results highlight the potential
		  impact of country-wide reductions of incidence of rubella
		  on the local CRS burdens in districts with small population
		  sizes. However, simulations indicate that if rubella
		  vaccination is introduced with coverage reflecting current
		  estimates for measles coverage in South Africa, the burden
		  of CRS is likely to be reduced overall over a 30 year time

		  fetal death or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) with
		  multiple disabilities. Reduction of transmission via
		  universal vaccination can prevent CRS, but inadequate
		  coverage may increase CRS numbers by increasing the average
		  age at infection. Consequently, many countries do not
		  vaccinate against rubella. The World Health Organization
		  recommends that for safe rubella vaccination, at least 80\%
		  coverage of each birth cohort should be sustained. The
		  nonlinear relationship between CRS burden and infection
		  dynamics has been much studied; however, how the complex
		  interaction between epidemic and demographic dynamics
		  affects minimum safe levels of coverage has not been
		  quantitatively evaluated across scales necessary for a
		  global assessment. We modelled 30-year CRS burdens across
		  epidemiological and demographic settings, including the
		  effect of local interruption of transmission via stochastic
		  fadeout. Necessary minimum vaccination coverage increases
		  markedly with birth and transmission rates, independent of
		  amplitude of seasonal fluctuations in transmission.
		  Susceptible build-up in older age groups following local
		  stochastic extinction of rubella increased CRS burden,
		  indicating that spatial context is important. In low
		  birth-rate settings, 80\% routine coverage is a
		  conservative guideline, particularly if supplemented with
		  campaigns and vaccination of women of childbearing age.
		  Where birth and transmission rates are high, immunization
		  coverage must be well above 80\% and campaigns may be
		  needed. Policy-makers should be aware of the potential
		  negative effect of local extinction of rubella, since
		  heterogeneity in vaccination coverage will shape extinction
		  patterns, potentially increasing CRS burdens.},

		  risk of isoniazid-resistant TB among individuals previously
		  treated with IPT, community-wide IPT programs may
		  nonetheless generate substantial selective pressure and
		  increase the burden of drug-resistant TB (DRTB). We
		  developed mathematical models to identify the conditions
		  under which community-wide IPT interventions could increase
		  the burden of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium
		  tuberculosis, even when we assumed that IPT does not select
		  for resistance among those treated with IPT. We found that

		  competition (such as partial immunity conferred by a
		  previous M. tuberculosis infection), community-wide IPT
		  interventions conferred an indirect benefit to
		  drug-resistant strains through selective suppression of
		  drug-sensitive infections. This result suggests that the
		  absence of an observed elevation in the risk of DRTB among
		  those receiving IPT in small-scale studies of limited
		  duration does not imply that the selective pressure imposed
		  by community-wide IPT will not be substantial.
		  Community-wide IPT may play an important role in TB control
		  in these settings, and its rollout should be accompanied by
		  interventions to detect and treat drug-resistant disease.},

		  (Model I), K1 was 13.7 (+/- 1.4) molal-1 (in the activity
		  basis) at 25 degrees C; when the binding of a third ion was
		  included (Model II), it was 13.0 (+/- 2.0) molal-1. The
		  second binding constant K2 was model dependent; it was 1.6
		  (+/- 0.2) and 3-4 molal-1 for Models I and II,
		  respectively. The rate constants, k-1 and k-2, of Na+ for
		  exit from singly and doubly loaded channels, respectively,
		  were 8 X 10(5) s-1 less than or equal to k-1 less than or
		  equal to 3 X 10(6) s-1 and 8 X 10(5) s-1 less than or equal
		  to k-2 less than or equal to 1.0 X 10(7) s-1 at 25 degrees
		  C; the lower bound represents a rough approximation of k-1.
		  The ratio k-2/k-1 was greater than one and did not greatly
		  exceed 20. From the competition experiment, K1 of T1+ was
		  5.7 (+/- 0.6) X 10(2) molal-1. The longitudinal relaxation
		  time T1 of bound 23Na in the state of single occupancy (T
		  1B sing) was virtually independent of models, 0.56 (+/-
		  0.03) and 0.55 (+/- 0.04) ms at 25 degrees C for Models I
		  and II, respectively. For the state of double occupancy, T1
		  of bound 23Na (T 1B doub) was model dependent: 0.27 (+/-
		  0.01) and 0.4-0.6 ms for Models I and II. The correlation
		  time tau c of bound 23Na was 2.2 (+/- 0.2) ns at 25 degrees
		  C for single occupancy; tau c for double occupancy was not
		  significantly different from this value. The estimated tau
		  c was found to involve no appreciable contribution of the
		  exchange of 23Na between the channel and the bulk solution.
		  ThÃƒÂ© quadrupole coupling constant chi was 1.0 (+/-
		  0.1) MHz for 23Na in single occupancy; chi for double
		  occupancy was 0.9-1.4 MHz, depending on models. A lower
		  bound of the average quadrupole coupling constant chi alpha
		  was 0.13-0.26 MHz at 25 degrees C for 23Na in single
		  occupancy; this value represents a rough approximation of
		  chi alpha at this temperature. An argument based on the
		  estimated chi alpha and the known conformation of the
		  gramicidin channel suggests that the binding site is a
		  small domain near the channel end. Within the framework of

		  Conjugated and unconjugated Bil were measured using the
		  Weber-Schalm extraction method. Bilirubin covalently bound

		  the sum of the CB and UCB concentrations determined by the
		  W-S method or as the nonprecipitated fraction after
		  deproteinization with ammonium sulfate-saturated ethanol
		  when using DS. The TB, CB, UCB, and CBBA levels were

		  duct ligation (CBDL) and internal choledochocaval
		  anastomosis (CDCA). The mean TB in internal CDCA (16.5 +/-

		  strategies in the model are defined by specifying the value

  abstract	= {Understanding the risk of airborne transmission can
		  provide important information for designing safe healthcare
		  environments with an appropriate level of environmental
		  control for mitigating risks. The most common approach for
		  assessing risk is to use the Wells-Riley equation to relate
		  infectious cases to human and environmental parameters.
		  While it is a simple model that can yield valuable
		  information, the model used as in its original presentation
		  has a number of limitations. This paper reviews recent
		  developments addressing some of the limitations including
		  coupling with epidemic models to evaluate the wider impact
		  of control measures on disease progression, linking with
		  zonal ventilation or computational fluid dynamics
		  simulations to deal with imperfect mixing in real
		  environments and recent work on dose-response modelling to
		  simulate the interaction between pathogens and the host. A
		  stochastic version of the Wells-Riley model is presented
		  that allows consideration of the effects of small
		  populations relevant in healthcare settings and it is
		  demonstrated how this can be linked to a simple zonal
		  ventilation model to simulate the influence of proximity to
		  an infector. The results show how neglecting the stochastic
		  effects present in a real situation could underestimate the
		  risk by 15 per cent or more and that the number and rate of
		  new infections between connected spaces is strongly
		  dependent on the airflow. Results also indicate the
		  potential danger of using fully mixed models for future
		  risk assessments, with quanta values derived from such
		  cases less than half the actual source value.},

  abstract	= {Despite an increase in global measles vaccine coverage
		  from under 20\% in 1980 to around 80\% in 1990, measles
		  remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality
		  world-wide. This paper addresses a number of issues
		  relating to efforts to control measles, namely, (i) at the
		  global level, how might we assess the impact of measles
		  vaccination on the incidence of infection and associated
		  disease, and, (ii), at the strategic level, how can we
		  utilise an understanding of the transmission dynamics of
		  childhood viral infections to aid the design of optimal
		  immunisation programmes? Based on WHO vaccine coverage
		  data, and organising countries according to similarities in
		  demographic and epidemiological parameters, an
		  age-structured model of measles transmission is used to
		  capture the non-linear dynamics of infection and mass
		  vaccination and to generate projections of the impact of
		  measles immunization world-wide. The results provide a
		  crude indication of the percentage reduction in measles
		  cases by year 2000 (compared with no immunization) and
		  suggest an approximately 70\% reduction in cases over all
		  ages, and 77\% reduction in cases under 5 years (where
		  there is the greatest risk of case fatality); these suggest
		  that WHO targets for 1995 are unlikely to be achieved. In
		  the second part of the paper, examples are given to
		  illustrate the usefulness of a modelling approach in
		  evaluating measles immunization policy. The introduction of
		  MMR vaccine in the UK in 1988 has resulted in measles
		  incidence falling to an all time low and attention has
		  turned to the requirements of elimination. A realistic age
		  structured model, validated using extensive serological
		  data, is used to compare the merits of single or two dose
		  strategies. Based upon recent estimates of vaccine efficacy
		  (90\%) and coverage (92\% by end of second year of life) it
		  is suggested that a two-dose policy with a pre-school
		  second dose given irrespective of vaccine history is
		  required to prevent the build up of susceptibles to
		  epidemic proportions in the longer term. In a second
		  example, prompted by the success of the campaign approach
		  to polio and measles elimination in Central and South
		  America, simple models are used to explore and quantify the
		  process by which pulse vaccination programmes (i.e.
		  repeated application across a wide age range) act to
		  control transmission.},

		  an aqueous solution of L (0.01Ã¢â‚¬â€°M Tris-HCl,
		  pHÃ¢â‚¬â€¦7.4) led to the successive formation of
		  [LnL] and [Ln(2)L] complexes, as evidenced by UV/Vis and
		  fluorescence titration experiments. Homodinuclear [Ln(2)L]
		  complexes (Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb, Yb, and Lu) were prepared and
		  characterized. The (1)H and (13)CÃ¢â‚¬â€¦NMR
		  spectra of the Lu and Yb complexes in D(2)O solution (pD =
		  7.0) showed C(1) symmetry of these species in solution,
		  pointing to two different chemical environments for the two
		  lanthanide cations. The analysis of the chemical shifts of
		  the Yb complex indicated that the two coordination sites
		  present square antiprismatic (SAP) coordination
		  environments around the metal ions. The spectroscopic
		  properties of the [Tb(2)L] complex upon ligand excitation
		  revealed conventional behavior with Ã�â€ž(H2O) =
		  2.05(1)Ã¢â‚¬â€¦ms and Ã�â€¢(H2O) = 51\%,
		  except for the calculation of the hydration number obtained
		  from the luminescent lifetimes in H(2)O and D(2)O, which
		  pointed to a non-integer value of 0.6 water molecules per
		  Tb(III) ion. In contrast, the Eu complex revealed
		  surprising features such as: 1)Ã¢â‚¬â€¦the
		  presence of two and up to five components in the
		  (5)D(0)Ã¢â€ â€™(7)F(0) and
		  (5)D(0)Ã¢â€ â€™(7)F(1) emission bands,
		  respectively; 2)Ã¢â‚¬â€¦marked differences
		  between the normalized spectra obtained in H(2)O and D(2)O
		  solutions; and 3)Ã¢â‚¬â€¦unconventional temporal
		  evolution of the luminescence intensity at certain
		  wavelengths, the intensity profile first displaying a
		  rising step before the occurrence of the expected decay.
		  Additional spectroscopic experiments performed on
		  [Gd(2-x)Eu(x)L] complexes (x = 0.1 and 1.9) confirmed the
		  presence of two distinct Eu sites with hydration numbers of
		  0 (site I) and 2 (site II), and showed that the
		  unconventional temporal evolution of the emission intensity
		  is the result of an unprecedented intramolecular Eu-to-Eu
		  energy-transfer process. A mathematical model was developed
		  to interpret the experimental data, leading to
		  energy-transfer rates of 0.98Ã¢â‚¬â€¦ms(-1) for
		  the transfer from the site with q=0 to that with q=2 and
		  vice versa. Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory
		  (DFT) calculations performed at the B3LYP level were used
		  to investigate the conformation of the complex in solution,
		  and to estimate the intermetallic distance, which provided
		  FÃƒÂ¶rster radii (R(0)) values of
		  8.1Ã¢â‚¬â€¦Ãƒâ€¦ for the energy transfer
		  from site I to site II, and
		  6.8Ã¢â‚¬â€¦Ãƒâ€¦ for the reverse energy

		  identical lanthanide cations within a discrete molecular

  abstract	= {Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most successful
		  bacterial parasites of humans, infecting over one-third of
		  the population of the world as latent infection without
		  clinical manifestations. Over 8.8 million new cases and
		  nearly 2 million deaths by tuberculosis (TB) occur
		  annually. TB poses a significant health threat to the world
		  population. The goal of this symposium is to open new
		  avenues for combating tuberculosis. The speakers have
		  presented their data and provided control strategies
		  against tuberculosis and pulmonary disease due to M. avium
		  complex (MAC) from aspects of molecular epidemiology,
		  pathogenesis, serodiagnosis, new anti-TB drugs, and vaccine
		  development. Drs. Maeda and Murase have reported that the
		  12-locus VNTR analysis is very useful for molecular
		  epidemiology of M. tuberculosis strains isolated in Japan
		  better than IS6110-RFLP and suggested that the analysis is
		  powerful tool for the molecular epidemiology. Drs.
		  Matsumoto and Kobayashi have discovered a protein,
		  mycobacterial DNA-binding protein 1 (MDPl), overproduced in
		  dormant M. tuberculosis that plays key roles in latent/
		  persistent infection, disease progression, and host
		  protection. They have concluded that MDP1 may be a possible
		  target for anti-tuberculosis drugs and vaccines. Drs.
		  Kitada and Maekura have developed serodiagnosis of MAC
		  disease based on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) by detecting
		  anti-glycopeptidolipid (GPL) antibody in sera of human
		  patients. GPL is specific for MAC. The EIA is a simple,
		  rapid and accurate measure with high sensitivity and
		  specificity. The levels of antibody also reflect disease
		  activity. A large-scale clinical multicenter study is
		  currently in progress. Dr. Makoto Matsumoto has discovered
		  an innovative new anti-TB drug, OPC-67683 that is a
		  derivative of nitroimidazole compounds. OPC-67683 inhibited
		  mycolic acid synthesis and exerted potent antimycobacterial
		  activity, including multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis.
		  Multidrug therapy using OPC-67683 could also shorten the
		  course of chemotherapy. The drug is clearly the most
		  promising new anti-TB agent that has been identified in
		  many years. Dr. Okada has presented the vaccine candidates
		  for TB, such as HVJ-liposome/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA and
		  HVJ-envelope/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA. The candidates exhibited
		  an excellent protective efficacy in mice compared to
		  current BCG vaccine, and improved histopathologic lesions
		  induced by M. tuberculosis infection. The candidates also
		  exerted the therapeutic effect in mice against both
		  drugsusceptible TB and extensively drug-resistant TB. Using
		  the cynomolgus monkey model (similar to human TB),
		  HVJ-liposome/ HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA provided higher
		  protective efficacy than BCG assessed by mortality. The
		  combination of BCG and HVJ-liposome/HSP65 DNA+IL-12 DNA by
		  the prime-booster procedure could lead to a synergistic
		  effect of 100\% survival in infected monkeys. These data
		  suggest that the novel DNA vaccine is a possible candidate
		  for human clinical trials. This symposium has highlighted
		  new advances in our understanding of molecular epidemiology
		  and pathogenesis of "Mycobacteriology" and development of
		  new serodiagnostics, anti-TB drugs, and vaccines. 1. The
		  establishment of the quick genotyping method for TB in
		  Japan using the variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR):
		  Shinji MAEDA, Yoshiro MURASE (Research Institute of
		  Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association) The
		  12-locus VNTR analysis that we have established optimally
		  for Mycobacteriun tuberculosis in Japan was superior to the
		  proposed 15-locus VNTR method in European countries. The
		  discriminatory power of our system was also higher than
		  that of IS6110-based restriction fragment length
		  polymorphism analysis. In future, we will investigate the
		  stability of copy number in each locus by using the strains
		  that suspected epidemiological links in contact
		  investigations. 2. A virulence factor of Mycobacterium
		  tuberculosis, which contributes to persistent infection,
		  reactivation, and host protection: Sohkichi MATSUMOTO
		  (Department of Host Defense, Osaka City University Graduate
		  School of Medicine), Kazuo KOBAYASHI (Department of
		  Immunology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases)
		  Majority of adult tuberculosis is caused by reactivation of
		  previously implanted Mycobacterium tuberculosis. During
		  latent infection, some bacilli are in dormant state, which
		  confers some survival advantage to not only bacteria but
		  also the host. We presented that a protein overproduced in
		  dormant M. tuberculosis plays key roles in persistent
		  infection, disease progression, and host protection. We
		  also presented utility of this protein, such as development
		  of anti-tuberculosis drug and vaccine. 3. Serodiagnosis of
		  Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease by enzyme
		  immunoassay using glycopeptidolipid antigen: Seigo KITADA,
		  Ryoji MAEKURA (Department of Internal Medicine, National
		  Hospital Organization National Toneyama Hospital) The
		  diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease
		  (MAC-PD) and/or its discrimination from pulmonary
		  tuberculosis is sometimes complicated and time consuming.
		  We have developed serological test by enzyme immunoassay
		  that detect serum antibody to glycopeptidolipid antigen.
		  The serodiagnosis is useful for the rapid diagnosis of
		  MAC-PD and differential diagnosis from pulmonary TB. The
		  antibody levels reflected the disease activity including
		  radiographic severity. 4. A novel antituberculous agent,
		  OPC-67683: Research and development: Makoto MATSUMOTO
		  (Microbiological Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical
		  Co., Ltd.) We initiated a program to screen new
		  antituberculous agents that have potential to shorten the
		  total duration of treatment, provide improved efficacy
		  against MDR-TB, be useful in treating HIV co-infected
		  patients, and target latent TB infections. Our efforts led
		  to the discovery of OPC-67683, a novel oxazo-imidazole
		  derivative with a distinctive characteristic as a subclass
		  mycolic acid inhibitor. Our evaluation studies confirmed
		  OPC-67683 to possess potent in vitro and in vivo
		  antituberculous activity, suggesting potential usefulness
		  in alleviating the current TB problems. 5. The development
		  of novel vaccines against M. tuberculosis: Masaji OKADA
		  (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization
		  Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center) We have developed a novel
		  tuberculosis (TB) vaccine (HVJ-liposome/ or
		  HVJ-envelope/HSP65 DNA+ IL-12 DNA). The vaccine provided
		  remarkable protective efficacy in mouse compared to BCG
		  vaccine, and improved the histopathological tuberculosis
		  lesions. This vaccine also exerted therapeutic effect in
		  vivo against XDR-TB as well as drug-sensitive TB in mice.
		  Furthermore, by using the cynomolgus monkey (similar to
		  human tuberculosis), this novel vaccine provided higher
		  protective efficacy (mortality) than BCG mortality.
		  Furthermore, the combination of HSP65+IL-12/HVJ and BCG by
		  the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in
		  the TB-infected cynomolgus monkey (100\% survival). These
		  data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful
		  against TB for human clinical trials.},

		  the factors that predict the distribution and timing of
		  outbreaks will enable their prevention and facilitate the
		  completion of global eradication.Children with
		  poliomyelitis in Africa from 1 January 2003 to 31 December
		  2010 were identified through routine surveillance of cases
		  of acute flaccid paralysis, and separate outbreaks
		  associated with importation of wild-type poliovirus were
		  defined using the genetic relatedness of these viruses in
		  the VP1/2A region. Potential explanatory variables were
		  examined for their association with the number, size, and
		  duration of poliomyelitis outbreaks in 6-mo periods using
		  multivariable regression analysis. The predictive ability
		  of 6-mo-ahead forecasts of poliomyelitis outbreaks in each
		  country based on the regression model was assessed. A total
		  of 142 genetically distinct outbreaks of poliomyelitis were
		  recorded in 25 African countries, resulting in 1-228 cases
		  (median of two cases). The estimated number of people
		  arriving from infected countries and <5-y childhood
		  mortality were independently associated with the number of
		  outbreaks. Immunisation coverage based on the reported
		  vaccination history of children with non-polio acute
		  flaccid paralysis was associated with the duration and size
		  of each outbreak, as well as the number of outbreaks.
		  Six-month-ahead forecasts of the number of outbreaks in a
		  country or region changed over time and had a predictive
		  ability of 82\%.Outbreaks of poliomyelitis resulted
		  primarily from continued transmission in Nigeria and the
		  poor immunisation status of populations in neighbouring
		  countries. From 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2011, reduced
		  transmission in Nigeria and increased incidence in
		  reinfected countries in west and central Africa have

		  liver disease and liver cancer worldwide according to the
		  World Health Organization. Following acute HBV infection,
		  1-5\% of infected healthy adults and up to 90\% of infected
		  infants become chronic carriers and have an increased risk
		  of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim
		  of this study was to investigate the relationship between
		  the reduction in acute hepatitis B incidence and the
		  universal vaccination programme in preadolescents in
		  Catalonia (Spain), taking population changes into account,
		  and to construct a model to forecast the future incidence
		  of cases that permits the best preventive strategy to be
		  adopted.Reported acute hepatitis B incidence in Catalonia
		  according to age, gender, vaccination coverage, percentage
		  of immigrants and the year of report of cases was analysed.
		  A statistical analysis was made using three models:
		  generalized linear models (GLM) with Poisson or negative
		  binomial distribution and a generalized additive model
		  (GAM).The higher the vaccination coverage, the lower the
		  reported incidence of hepatitis B (p <0.01). In groups with
		  vaccination
		  coverageÃ¢â‚¬â€°>Ã¢â‚¬â€°70\%, the
		  reduction in incidence was 2-fold higher than in groups

		  males of working age (19-49Ã¢â‚¬â€°years).The
		  results of the adjusted models in this study confirm that
		  the global incidence of hepatitis B has declined in

		  preadolescent vaccination programme, but the incidence
		  increased in male immigrants of working age. Given the
		  potential severity of hepatitis B for the health of

  abstract	= {Thermal hysteresis may be used to quantify and
		  characterize the amount of heat stress an animal
		  experiences. Heat stress studies of farm animals suggest
		  that above a certain threshold body temperature (Tb) is
		  driven by ambient temperature (Ta). Patterns in the Tb-Ta
		  phase diagram indicate the presence of hysteresis. When
		  hysteresis is present, there are two values for Tb
		  depending on whether Ta is increasing or decreasing. A
		  theoretical delay-relay model is proposed to illustrate the
		  hysteretic dynamics of the Tb-Ta relationship when Ta is
		  cyclic. Two types of hysteresis, transitional and thermal,
		  are identified. Thermal hysteresis becomes prominent when
		  Ta forces Tb into an elliptical limit cycle. The area of
		  the ellipse is an indication of the animal's heat load.
		  Also, the resulting Tb-Ta pattern depends on the delay (or
		  lag) between Tb and Ta. The delay suggests possible levels
		  of heat stress. A greater delay between Tb and Ta indicates
		  more time is needed to dissipate the heat load, implying
		  the animal is suffering more heat stress. For a given Ta,
		  the Tb on the decreasing (recovery) path is always higher
		  than the Tb on the increasing (challenge) path.
		  Essentially, the animal requires more energy to dissipate
		  heat than to absorb it.},

		  worldwide. The extent of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
		  resistance to fluoroquinolones depends on the mutation in

		  tuberculosis H37Rv in vivo. We infected Swiss mice with

		  The MICs of the mutant strains ranged from below to above

		  horridus were selected as a case for the development of the
		  quantitative PAR (QPAR) concept. The residual complexity of
		  the purified triterpenes was initially evaluated by 1D- and
		  2D-NMR and identified as a combination of structurally
		  related and unrelated impurities. Using a biochemometric
		  approach, the qHNMR purity and anti-TB activity of
		  successive chromatographic fractions of O. horridus
		  triterpenes were correlated by linear regression analysis
		  to generate a mathematical QPAR model. The results
		  demonstrate that impurities, such as widely occurring
		  monoglycerides, can have a profound impact on the observed
		  antimycobacterial activity of triterpene-enriched
		  fractions. The QPAR concept is shown to be capable of
		  providing a quantitative assessment in situations where
		  residually complex constitution contributes toward the

		  decreasing worldwide. Given that TB is a cosmopolitan
		  disease, proper surveillance and evaluation are critical
		  for controlling dissemination. Herein, mathematical
		  modeling was performed in order to: 1) demonstrate a
		  correlation between the incidence of TB in HIV-free
		  patients in the US and Germany, and their corresponding
		  mortality rates; 2) show the utility of the newly developed
		  D-R algorithm for analyzing and predicting the incidence of
		  TB in both countries; and 3) inform us on population death
		  rates due to TB in HIV-negative patients. Using data
		  published by the World Health Organization between 1990 and
		  2009, the relationship between incidence and mortality that
		  could not be ascribed to HIV infection was evaluated. Using
		  linear, quadratic and cubic curves, we found that a cubic
		  function provided the best fit with the data in both the US
		  (Y = 2.3588+2.2459X+61.1639X(2)-60.104X(3)) and Germany (Y
		  = 1.9271+9.4967X+18.3824X(2)-10.350X(3)) where the
		  correlation coefficient (R) between incidence and mortality
		  was 0.995 and 0.993, respectively. Second, we demonstrated
		  that fitted curves using the D-R model were equal to or
		  better than those generated using the GM(1,1) algorithm as
		  exemplified in the relative values for Sum of Squares of
		  Error, Relative Standard Error, Mean Absolute Deviation,
		  Average Relative Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error.
		  Finally, future trends using both the D-R and the classic
		  GM(1,1) models predicted a continued decline in infection
		  and mortality rates of TB in HIV-negative patients rates
		  extending to 2015 assuming no changes to diagnosis or

  abstract	= {Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among
		  individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus
		  (HIV). The study of the joint dynamics of HIV and TB
		  present formidable mathematical challenges due to the fact
		  that the models of transmission are quite distinct.
		  Furthermore, although there is overlap in the populations
		  at risk of HIV and TB infections, the magnitude of the
		  proportion of individuals at risk for both diseases is not
		  known. Here, we consider a highly simplified deterministic
		  model that incorporates the joint dynamics of TB and HIV, a
		  model that is quite hard to analyze. We compute independent
		  reproductive numbers for TB (R1) and HIV (R2) and the
		  overall reproductive number for the system, R=max{R1, R2}.
		  The focus is naturally (given the highly simplified nature
		  of the framework) on the qualitative analysis of this
		  model. We find that if R < 1 then the disease-free
		  equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. The TB-only
		  equilibrium ET is locally asymptotically stable if R1 < 1
		  and R2 < 1. However, the symmetric condition, R1 < 1 and R2
		  > 1, does not necessarily guarantee the stability of the
		  HIV-only equilibrium EH, and it is possible that TB can
		  coexist with HIV when R2 > 1. In other words, in the case
		  when R1 < 1 and R2 > 1 (or when R1 > 1 and R2 > 1), we are
		  able to find a stable HIV/TB coexistence equilibrium.
		  Moreover, we show that the prevalence level of TB increases
		  with R2 > 1 under certain conditions. Through simulations,
		  we find that i) the increased progression rate from latent
		  to active TB in co-infected individuals may play a
		  significant role in the rising prevalence of TB; and ii)
		  the increased progression rates from HIV to AIDS have not
		  only increased the prevalence level of HIV while decreasing
		  TB prevalence, but also generated damped oscillations in
		  the system.},

		  shorter regimens on TB incidence and mortality have not yet

		  we considered general relationships between treatment
		  duration and TB dynamics. Next, as a specific example, we
		  calibrated the model to reflect the current situation in
		  the South-East Asia region. We found that even with
		  continued and rapid progress in scaling up the World Health

		  treatment duration would be substantial. Compared to a
		  baseline of continuing DOTS coverage at current levels, and

		  cases and 25\% (range 19\%-29\%) of TB deaths in South-East

		  remain considerable (13\% [range 8\%-19\%] and 19\% [range
		  15\%-23\%] reductions in incidence and mortality,
		  respectively, between 2012 and 2030). A ten-year delay in

		  three-fourths of the total expected benefits in this region

		  regimens could dramatically accelerate the reductions in TB
		  incidence and mortality that are expected under current
		  regimens-with up to 2- or 3-fold increases in rates of

		  in body temperature (Tb) of free-ranging Crocodylus porosus
		  (32-1010 kg) can be predicted by a mathematical analysis.
		  The analysis provides a mechanistic explanation for the
		  decreased amplitude of daily cycles in Tb and the increase
		  in 'average' Tb with increasing mass. Assessments of
		  'average' daily Tb were made by dividing the integral of
		  the difference between measured values of Tb and minimum
		  operative temperature by the period of integration, to
		  yield a thermal index expressing relative 'warmth' of
		  crocodiles. The average daily Tb of a 1010 kg crocodile was
		  3.7 degreesC warmer than that of a 42 kg individual in
		  summer and 1.9 degreesC warmer than that of a 32 kg
		  individual in winter. The success of this mathematical
		  approach confirms that crocodiles are simple ectotherms and
		  that there is unlikely to be a significant contribution to
		  their thermal biology from physiological mechanisms.
		  Behaviour, however, is very important even in large
		  individuals. Crocodiles in the field typically move daily
		  between land and water in cycles that vary seasonally. We
		  predicted Tb for the reverse of these behavioural cycles,
		  which more than doubled seasonal fluctuations in Tb
		  compared with the observed fluctuations. We were also able
		  to predict the Tb of very large, dinosaur-sized crocodiles
		  in a similar climate to that at our study site. A 10 000 kg
		  'crocodile', for example, would be expected to have a Tb of
		  31 degreesC in winter, varying by less than 0.1 degreesC
		  during a day when operative temperatures varied by nearly
		  20 degreesC, from 20 to 38 degreesC. The study confirms
		  that, in low latitudes at least, large dinosaurs must have
		  had an essentially high and stable value of Tb, without any
		  need for endothermy. Also, access to shade or water must
		  have been crucial for the survival of large dinosaurs at
		  low latitudes. Furthermore, the finding of increasing
		  'average' Tb as ectotherms grow larger may have
		  implications for the metabolic rates of very large
		  reptiles, because the Q10 effect could counteract the
		  downscaling of metabolic rate with mass, an effect that
		  seems not to have been recognised previously.},

		  is an effective strategy to mitigate the spread of the

		  acceptance remains relatively uncertain in many societies.
		  The purpose of this study was to examine the beliefs,
		  attitudes and practices associated with the intention to
		  get vaccinated against the A/H1N1 virus among the general
		  population in France. METHODS: A representative sample of
		  1001 individuals (stratified random recruitment procedure,
		  ages 16-90 years) was interviewed by telephone. The
		  questionnaire included a variety of items associated with
		  socio-demographic characteristics, risk perceptions,
		  illness perceptions, political attitudes and worldviews as
		  well as intention to get vaccinated. RESULTS: More than 6
		  out of 10 of the respondents indicated that they planned to
		  get vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available. The same
		  proportion of parents also reported the intention to
		  vaccinate their children against the disease. In multiple
		  regression analyses, socio-cognitive factors consistently
		  predicting influenza A/H1N1 vaccination were: level of
		  worry, risk perception and previous experience of vaccine
		  against seasonal flu. CONCLUSIONS: The factors found to
		  predict vaccination intention and their distribution are
		  assumed to be a consequence of the fact that people
		  perceive the risk of swine flu to be similar to that of
		  seasonal flu. As a result, in the absence of an increase of
		  the risk perception of pandemic influenza A/H1N1, a very
		  low level of actual vaccination is forecasted. Behavioural
		  change would require that the risks and consequences of
		  pandemic influenza A/H1N1 be perceived as highly different
		  from seasonal flu.},

		  number is less than unity, has important implications for

		  effectiveness of vector control interventions, an
		  understanding of the contemporary distribution of each
		  species, combined with a synthesis of the current knowledge
		  of their behaviour and ecology is needed.Expert opinion
		  (EO) range maps, created with the most up-to-date expert
		  knowledge of each DVS distribution, were combined with a
		  contemporary database of occurrence data and a suite of
		  open access, environmental and climatic variables. Using
		  the Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) modelling method,
		  distribution maps of each DVS were produced. The occurrence
		  data were abstracted from the formal, published literature,
		  plus other relevant sources, resulting in the collation of
		  DVS occurrence at 10116 locations across 31 countries, of
		  which 8853 were successfully geo-referenced and 7430 were

		  where transmission is maintained by some of the world's

		  measures have significantly reduced transmission, yet
		  elimination remains a distant target. Knowing the relative
		  abundance of the primary vector species can provide
		  transmission models with much needed information to guide
		  targeted control measures. Moreover, understanding how
		  existing interventions are impacting on these relative
		  abundances highlights where alternative control (e.g.,
		  larval source management) is needed.Using the habitat
		  suitability probabilities generated by predictive species
		  distribution models combined with data collated from the
		  literature, a multinomial generalized additive model was
		  applied to produce relative abundance estimates for
		  Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles funestus and Anopheles
		  gambiae/Anopheles coluzzii. Using pre- and
		  post-intervention abundance data, estimates of the effect
		  of indoor insecticide-based interventions on these relative
		  abundances were made and are illustrated in
		  post-intervention maps.Conditional effect plots and
		  relative abundance maps illustrate the individual species'
		  predicted habitat suitability and how they interact when in
		  sympatry. Anopheles arabiensis and An. funestus show an
		  affinity in habitat preference at the expense of An.
		  gambiae/An. coluzzii, whereas increasing habitat
		  suitability for An. gambiae/An. coluzzii is conversely less
		  suitable for An. arabiensis but has little effect on An.
		  funestus. Indoor insecticide-based interventions had a
		  negative impact on the relative abundance of An. funestus,
		  and a lesser effect on An. arabiensis. Indoor residual
		  spraying had the greatest impact on the relative abundance
		  of An. funestus, and a lesser effect on An. gambiae/An.
		  coluzzii. Insecticide-treated bed nets reduced the relative
		  abundance of both species equally. These results do not
		  indicate changes in the absolute abundance of these
		  species, which may be reduced for all species overall.The
		  maps presented here highlight the interactions between the
		  primary vector species in sub-Saharan Africa and
		  demonstrate that An. funestus is more susceptible to
		  certain indoor-based insecticide interventions than An.
		  gambiae/An. coluzzii, which in turn, is more susceptible
		  than An. arabiensis. This may provide An. arabiensis with a
		  competitive advantage where it is found in sympatry with
		  other more endophilic vectors, and potentially increase the
		  need for outdoor-based vector interventions to deal with

  abstract	= {Although theoretical approaches to tracheobronchial (TB)
		  clearance have been continuously refined during the past
		  decades, questions concerning the exact course of particle
		  removal from the TB tree have been largely remained
		  unsolved. In order to clarify this problem,
		  three-dimensional patterns of mucociliary particle
		  clearance have to be generated at pre-defined time points
		  after particle exposure. Here, we present a mathematical
		  method for the generation of respective clearance patterns.
		  Three-dimensional transport paths of inhaled particles as
		  well as spatial deposition patterns were generated by
		  determining spatial information of all airway tubes passed
		  by the particles and the particle deposition sites.
		  Three-dimensional data were converted to a coordinate
		  system, within which the trachea represented the z-axis.
		  Visualization of stored data was realized with the help of
		  a freely available program code that is specialized in
		  processing huge data sets. Mucociliary clearance of
		  deposited particular mass was computed by assuming (1) an
		  interrelationship between mucus velocity and airway caliber
		  and (2) an average tracheal mucus velocity of 5.5mm
		  min(-1). Position of cleared particles within the spatial
		  TB tree was determined at t=0 h (immediately after
		  exposure), t=12 h and t=24 h. Spatial patterns of
		  mucociliary clearance were computed for particles with a
		  uniform geometric diameter of 5ÃŽÂ¼m and a density of
		  1g cm(-3). Inhalation of the aerosol loaded with those
		  particles took place under sitting breathing conditions
		  (breathing frequency: 15min(-1), tidal volume: 750 ml). As
		  demonstrated by the generated clearance patterns,
		  mucociliary transport of 5ÃŽÂ¼m particles is completed
		  after 30 h. Within the first 12 h following aerosol
		  exposure, about 75\% of the initially deposited particular
		  mass is removed from the TB tree. After 24 h, 95\% of the
		  particles have been cleared. Clearance patterns are
		  characterized by a successive transition of maximal
		  particle concentrations towards more proximal airway
		  generations. For 0.1ÃŽÂ¼m particles and 1ÃŽÂ¼m
		  particles clearance times are significantly prolonged,
		  whilst 10ÃŽÂ¼m particles are even faster removed from
		  the TB tree than the 5ÃŽÂ¼m particles. Based on the
		  results of this study the time span between initial
		  deposition of particular matter and complete evacuation of
		  deposited particles ranges from several hours to some days
		  and depends on (1) the preferential deposition site of the
		  inhaled material and (2) the mean mucus velocities in the
		  bronchial airway generations.},

		  Micro-CT and histomorphometry analyses were repeated twice.
		  Results were analyzed in separate groups and after pooling
		  the data. Bone histomorphometry detected generally known
		  differences between the diseases, whereas micro-CT did not
		  detect differences between normal and ROD samples as
		  effectively. Repeated measurements for BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N,
		  and Tb.Sp exhibited linear correlation coefficients (ρ) of

		  Correlations between BV/TV (micro-CT) and mineralized bone

		  reaction, k+, were determined by monitoring the absorbance
		  change upon formation of the metal-transferrin complex in
		  time range of milliseconds to seconds. The N and C sites
		  appeared to bind a particular metal ion with the same rate;
		  thus, average formation rate constants k+ (average) were
		  2.4 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 and 8.3 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 for Cu(II) and
		  Tb(III) respectively. Site preference (N site for Cu(II)

		  in dissociation rate constant for the metals. Fe(III)
		  binding from Fe-nitrilotriacetate complex to
		  apo-ovotransferrin was found to be more rapid, giving an
		  average formation rate constant k+ (average) of 5 x 10(5)
		  M-1 s-1, which was followed by a slow increase in
		  absorbance at 465 nm. This slow process has an apparent
		  rate constant in the range 3 s-1 to 0.5 s-1, depending upon
		  the degree of Fe(III) saturation. The variation in the rate
		  of the second phase is thought to reflect the difference in
		  the rate of a conformational change for monoferric and

		  its conformation more rapidly (3.4 s-1) than diferric
		  ovotransferrin (0.52 s-1). A further absorbance decrease

		  be assigned to release of NTA from the complex, as

  abstract	= {The HIV/AIDS epidemic, one of the leading public health
		  problems to have affected sub-Sahara Africa, is a
		  multifaceted problem with social, behavioral and biological
		  aspects. In the absence of a cure, behavioral change has
		  been advocated as an intervention strategy for reversing
		  the epidemic. Empirical studies have found heavy alcohol
		  consumption to be a fueling factor for HIV/AIDS infection
		  and progression. Previously [20], we formulated and
		  analyzed a one-sex deterministic model to capture the
		  dynamics of this deadly interaction. But, since alcohol
		  drinking habits, consequent risky sexual practices,
		  alcohol-induced immune suppression, etc., can be different
		  for men and women, the primary objective of our present
		  paper is to construct a two-sex model aimed at shedding
		  light on how both sexes, with varying heavy alcohol
		  consumption trends, contribute differently to the HIV/AIDS
		  spread. Based on numerical simulations, supported by the
		  UNAIDS epidemiological software SPECTRUM and using the
		  available data, our study identifies heavy drinking among
		  men and women to be a major driving force for HIV/AIDS in
		  Botswana and sub-Sahara Africa and quantifies its hazardous
		  outcomes in terms of increased number of active TB cases
		  and economic burden caused by increased need for
		  AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART). Our simulations point to the
		  heavy-drinking habits of men as a major reason for the
		  continuing disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on women in
		  sub-Sahara Africa. Our analysis has revealed the
		  possibility of the phenomenon of backward bifurcation. In
		  contrast to the result in some HIV vaccination models [52],
		  backward bifurcation in our model is not removed by
		  replacing the corresponding standard incidence function
		  with a mass action incidence, but is removed by merging the
		  two susceptible classes of the same sex into one, i.e., by
		  ignoring acquisition of, and ongoing recovery from,
		  heavy-drinking habits among the susceptible population.},

  abstract	= {Achieving successful eradication of a disease requires
		  global cooperation to obtain a shared goal. Coordination of
		  the endgame may seem an obvious requirement for success,
		  but that does not ensure that cooperation will occur.To
		  analytically explore the need for cooperation to maintain
		  global polio eradication specifically related to creation
		  of a global polio vaccine stockpile and coordination of
		  oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) cessation.Using risk and
		  decision analysis and game theoretical concepts, we modeled
		  the importance of global cooperation in managing the risks
		  associated with polioviruses for a time horizon of 20 years
		  after successful global disruption of circulation of wild
		  polioviruses.Countries may wish to avoid the financial
		  costs of vaccination and risks for vaccine-associated
		  paralytic polio following eradication of wild polioviruses,
		  which may lead them to reduce their use of OPV. However,
		  reducing or stopping vaccination too soon and without
		  coordination poses serious risks, including the possibility
		  of reimportation of wild polioviruses and the possibility
		  of vaccine-derived polioviruses. Analysis of the risks for
		  potential outbreaks suggests the need for creation and
		  maintenance of a global stockpile of vaccine for outbreak
		  response. Game theoretical considerations show that
		  coordination of OPV cessation optimizes expected costs and
		  risks globally, despite the potential perceived incentives
		  for countries to stop OPV earlier or later than other
		  countries, or to continue OPV use indefinitely.This article
		  makes the strong case for global cooperation on risk
		  management and suggests that even though individual
		  countries may perceive their own risks as small, risks at
		  the global level warrant cooperative action and
		  coordination of OPV cessation.},

		  Because reinfection is more likely in high incidence
		  regions than in regions of low incidence, more tuberculosis
		  (TB) cases due to reinfection could be expected in
		  high-incidence regions than in low-incidence regions.
		  Empirical data from regions with various incidence rates
		  appear to confirm the conjecture that, in fact, the
		  incidence rate due to reinfection only, as a proportion of
		  all cases, correlates with the logarithm of the incidence
		  rate, rather than with the incidence rate itself. A
		  theoretical model that supports this conjecture is
		  presented. A Markov model was used to obtain a relationship
		  between incidence and reinfection rates. It was assumed in
		  this model that the rate of reinfection is a multiple, rho
		  (the reinfection factor), of the rate of first-time
		  infection, lambda. The results obtained show a relationship
		  between the proportion of cases due to reinfection and the
		  rate of incidence that is approximately logarithmic for a
		  range of values of the incidence rate typical of those
		  observed in communities across the globe. A value of rho is
		  determined such that the relationship between the
		  proportion of cases due to reinfection and the logarithm of
		  the incidence rate closely correlates with empirical data.
		  From a purely theoretical investigation, it is shown that a
		  simple relationship can be expected between the logarithm
		  of the incidence rates and the proportions of cases due to
		  reinfection after a prior episode of TB. This relationship
		  is sustained by a rate of reinfection that is higher than
		  the rate of first-time infection and this latter
		  consideration underscores the great importance of
		  monitoring recovered TB cases for repeat disease episodes,
		  especially in regions where TB incidence is high. Awareness
		  of this may assist in attempts to control the epidemic.},

		  (HCWs) remains the lowest compared with other priority

		  influenza vaccine among HCWs during the current campaign.
		  Between 23 December 2009 and 13 January 2010, once the
		  workplace vaccination program was over, we conducted a
		  cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey at the
		  University Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain). Five
		  hundred twenty-seven HCWs were asked about their influenza
		  immunization history during the 2009-2010 season, as well
		  as the reasons for accepting or declining either the
		  seasonal or pandemic vaccines. Multiple logistic-regression
		  analysis was preformed to identify variables associated
		  with immunization acceptance. A total of 262 HCWs (49.7\%)
		  reported having received the seasonal vaccine, while only
		  87 (16.5\%) affirmed having received the pandemic influenza
		  (H1N1) 2009 vaccine. "Self-protection" and "protection of
		  the patient" were the most frequently adduced reasons for
		  acceptance of the pandemic vaccination, whereas the
		  existence of "doubts about vaccine efficacy" and "fear of
		  adverse reactions" were the main arguments for refusal.
		  Simultaneous receipt of the seasonal vaccine (odds ratio
		  [OR]: 0.27; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: 0.14-0.52)
		  and being a staff (OR: 0.08; 95\% CI: 0.04-0.19) or a
		  resident physician (OR: 0.16; 95\% CI: 0.05-0.50) emerged
		  as independent predictors for pandemic vaccine acceptance,
		  whereas self-reported membership of a priority group was
		  associated with refusal (OR: 5.98; 95\% CI: 1.35-26.5). The
		  pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccination coverage among
		  the HCWs in our institution was very low (16.5\%),
		  suggesting the role of specific attitudinal barriers and
		  misconceptions about immunization in a global pandemic scenario.},

		  Macerated sagittal slices of T12 vertebral bodies from 15

		  (SEM). Two digital images (the second image tilted 5
		  degrees ) were recorded, and a 3D anaglyph was created. The
		  thickness of the trabecular rods (Tb.Th((rods))), and the
		  anatomical orientation of the trabecular rods were measured
		  using an image analyser. Conventional 2D histomorphometry
		  was performed on adjacent bone slices. A total of 1559 rod
		  measurements were made from the 15 vertebral bone slices,
		  with a mean Tb.Th((rods)) of 123 +/- 36 microm. The rod
		  thickness in males (128 +/- 34 microm) was significantly
		  greater than that in females (119 +/- 37 microm, P <
		  0.001). Tb.Th((rods)) changed significantly with age in the
		  males: the thicker rods in the younger men reduced with age
		  to a thickness similar to that in women. 3D measurements
		  were significantly larger than the 2D estimates, and there
		  was no correlation between the two methods of measurement.
		  An inverse correlation was found between the number of rods
		  and the bone volume fraction (BV/TV), indicating that
		  decreased BV/TV is associated with an increased number of
		  rods. The vertical rods (132 +/- 39 microm) were
		  significantly thicker than the horizontal rods (116 +/- 33
		  microm, P < 0.001). The determination of rod numbers, and
		  their orientation and individual thicknesses enables a
		  greater understanding of cancellous bone architecture in
		  both individuals and populations, and will allow more
		  reliable finite element modelling. Direct measurements from
		  3D anaglyphs of intact specimens provide new data that show

		  mathematical model has been developed to describe the
		  release of proteins from these hydrogel-based microspheres.
		  A kinetic Monte Carlo scheme for the degradation of a small

		  clustering of proteins on the release were investigated.
		  The model crosslink density (Xmodel) and the model
		  diffusivity (Dmodel) were fitted to experimental release
		  data of BSA monomer from hydroxyethyl methacrylated dextran
		  (dex-HEMA) microspheres. By using the experimental release

		  diffusivity of the protein (Dmodel) scales approximately
		  with 1/dh (Stokes-Einstein). Using these scaling relations,
		  quantitative predictions of the release curves of BSA
		  dimer, immunoglobulin G and human growth hormone were
		  possible. In conclusion, this model may play an important
		  role in the optimization, understanding and prediction of

		  analyze three alternative eradication strategies involving
		  a transition from continuous OPV vaccination to either
		  continuous Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV), pulsed OPV
		  vaccination, or a one-time IPV pulse vaccination.
		  Stochastic modeling shows continuous IPV vaccination is
		  effective at achieving eradication for moderate coverage
		  levels, while pulsed OPV is effective if higher coverage
		  levels are maintained. The one-time pulse IPV method may
		  also be a viable strategy, especially in terms of the
		  number of vaccinations required and time to eradication,
		  provided that a sufficiently large pulse is practically
		  feasible. More investigation is needed regarding the
		  frequency of revertant virus infection resulting directly
		  from vaccination, the ability of IPV to induce gut
		  immunity, and the potential role of spatial transmission
		  dynamics in eradication efforts.},

  abstract	= {Viruses contained in live-attenuated virus vaccines (LAVV)
		  can be transmitted between individuals, resulting in
		  secondary or contact vaccinations. This fact has been
		  exploited successfully in the use of the Oral Polio Vaccine
		  (OPV) to better control wild-type polio viruses. In this
		  work we analyze general LAVV vaccination models for
		  infections that confer lifelong immunity. We consider both
		  standard (continuous) vaccination strategies and pulse
		  vaccination programs (where mass vaccination is carried out
		  at regular intervals). For continuous vaccination, we
		  provide a complete global analysis of a very general
		  compartmental ordinary differential equation LAVV model. We
		  find that the threshold vaccination level required for the
		  eradication of wild-type virus depends on the basic
		  reproduction numbers of both the wild-type and vaccine
		  viruses, but is otherwise independent of the distributions
		  of the durations in each of the sequence of stages of
		  disease progression (e.g., latent, infectious, etc.).
		  Furthermore, even for vaccine viruses with reproduction
		  numbers below one, which would naturally fade from the
		  population upon cessation of vaccination, there can be a
		  significant reduction in the threshold vaccination level.
		  The dependence of the threshold vaccination level on the
		  virus reproduction numbers largely generalizes to the pulse
		  vaccination model. For shorter pulsing periods there is
		  negligible difference in threshold vaccination level as
		  compared to continuous vaccination campaigns. Thus, we
		  conclude that current policy in many countries to employ
		  annual pulsed OPV vaccination does not significantly
		  diminish the benefits of contact vaccination.},

		  tuberculosis to active TB due to TNF blockade. These 2
		  pathogenic mechanisms cannot otherwise be readily

		  methods were then used to identify for each pair of
		  incidence rates the Markov model parameters that most

		  TB as reported to the Food and Drug Administration.Modeling
		  revealed an apparent median monthly rate of reactivation of
		  LTBI by infliximab treatment of 20.8\%, which was 12.1
		  times that with etanercept treatment (P<0.001). In
		  contrast, both drugs appeared to pose a high risk of
		  progression of new M tuberculosis infection to active TB.
		  Progression of new infection appeared to cause nearly half
		  of the etanercept-associated cases; it became the
		  predominant cause of infliximab-associated cases only after
		  the first year.Despite sharing a common therapeutic target,
		  infliximab and etanercept differ markedly in the rates at
		  which they reactivate LTBI. Confirmation of these findings
		  will require the application of molecular epidemiologic
		  tools to studies of TB in future biologics registries.
		  Hidden Markov modeling and Monte Carlo simulation are
		  powerful tools for revealing otherwise hidden aspects of

		  depends on infectious individuals recognizing their
		  symptoms and voluntarily seeking diagnosis rapidly enough
		  to reduce onward transmission. It now appears, at least in
		  some settings, that more intensified case-finding (ICF)
		  approaches may be needed to control TB transmission; these
		  more aggressive approaches for detecting as-yet undiagnosed
		  cases obviously require additional resources to implement.
		  Given that TB control programs are resource constrained and

		  duct-cannulated rat exhibited a biexponential curve after

		  was selected based on the Akaike's information criterion
		  (AIC). The local moment characteristics for a single pass
		  through enterohepatic circulation were further calculated
		  from the time courses of both the plasma concentration and
		  the amount excreted into the bile. The recovery ratio (Fc)

  abstract	= {There is mounting evidence that the aerosol transmission
		  route plays a significant role in the spread of influenza
		  in temperate regions and that the efficiency of this route
		  depends on humidity. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms
		  by which humidity might influence transmissibility via the
		  aerosol route have not been elucidated. We hypothesize that
		  airborne concentrations of infectious influenza A viruses
		  (IAVs) vary with humidity through its influence on virus
		  inactivation rate and respiratory droplet size. To gain
		  insight into the mechanisms by which humidity might
		  influence aerosol transmission, we modeled the size
		  distribution and dynamics of IAVs emitted from a cough in
		  typical residential and public settings over a relative
		  humidity (RH) range of 10-90\%. The model incorporates the
		  size transformation of virus-containing droplets due to
		  evaporation and then removal by gravitational settling,
		  ventilation, and virus inactivation. The predicted
		  concentration of infectious IAVs in air is 2.4 times higher
		  at 10\% RH than at 90\% RH after 10 min in a residential
		  setting, and this ratio grows over time. Settling is
		  important for removal of large droplets containing large
		  amounts of IAVs, while ventilation and inactivation are
		  relatively more important for removal of IAVs associated
		  with droplets <5 Ã‚Âµm. The inactivation rate
		  increases linearly with RH; at the highest RH, inactivation
		  can remove up to 28\% of IAVs in 10 min. Humidity is an
		  important variable in aerosol transmission of IAVs because
		  it both induces droplet size transformation and affects IAV
		  inactivation rates. Our model advances a mechanistic
		  understanding of the aerosol transmission route, and
		  results complement recent studies on the relationship
		  between humidity and influenza's seasonality. Maintaining a
		  high indoor RH and ventilation rate may help reduce chances
		  of IAV infection.},

		  threat. Proper management of close contacts of infectious
		  patients is increasingly important. However, no
		  evidence-based recommendations for treating latent TB
		  infection (LTBI) after MDR/XDR-TB exposure (DR-LTBI) exist.
		  An ultrashort regimen for LTBI caused by drug-susceptible
		  strains (DS-LTBI) is also desirable. TMC207 has
		  bactericidal and sterilizing activity in animal models of
		  TB and improves the activity of current MDR-TB therapy in
		  patients.The objective of this study was to determine
		  whether TMC207 might enable short-course treatment of
		  DR-LTBI and ultrashort treatment of DS-LTBI.Using an
		  established experimental model of LTBI chemotherapy in
		  which mice are aerosol-immunized with a recombinant
		  bacillus Calmette-GuÃƒÂ©rin vaccine before low-dose
		  aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the
		  efficacy of TMC207 alone and in combination with
		  rifapentine was compared with currently recommended control
		  regimens as well as once-weekly rifapentine + isoniazid and
		  daily rifapentine Ã‚Â± isoniazid.Outcomes included
		  monthly lung colony-forming unit counts and relapse
		  rates.Lung colony-forming unit counts were stable at about
		  3.75 log(10) for up to 7.5 months postinfection in
		  untreated mice. Rifamycin-containing regimens were superior
		  to isoniazid monotherapy. TMC207 exhibited sterilizing
		  activity at least as strong as that of rifampin alone and
		  similar to that of rifampin + isoniazid, but daily
		  rifapentine +/- isoniazid was superior to TMC207. Addition
		  of TMC207 to rifapentine did not improve the sterilizing
		  activity of rifapentine in this model.TMC207 has
		  substantial sterilizing activity and may enable treatment
		  of DR-LTBI in 3-4 months.},

  abstract	= {The scarcity of grafts available necessitates a system
		  that considers expected posttransplant survival, in
		  addition to pretransplant mortality as estimated by the
		  MELD. So far, however, conventional linear techniques have
		  failed to achieve sufficient accuracy in posttransplant
		  outcome prediction. In this study, we aim to develop a
		  pretransplant predictive model for liver recipients'
		  survival with benign end-stage liver diseases (BESLD) by a
		  nonlinear method based on pretransplant characteristics,
		  and compare its performance with a BESLD-specific
		  prognostic model (MELD) and a general-illness severity
		  model (the sequential organ failure assessment score, or
		  SOFA score).With retrospectively collected data on 360
		  recipients receiving deceased-donor transplantation for
		  BESLD between February 1999 and August 2009 in the west
		  China hospital of Sichuan university, we developed a
		  multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to predict one-year
		  and two-year survival probability after transplantation.
		  The performances of the MLP, SOFA, and MELD were assessed
		  by measuring both calibration ability and discriminative
		  power, with Hosmer-Lemeshow test and receiver operating
		  characteristic analysis, respectively. By the forward
		  stepwise selection, donor age and BMI; serum concentration
		  of HB, Crea, ALB, TB, ALT, INR, Na(+); presence of
		  pretransplant diabetes; dialysis prior to transplantation,
		  and microbiologically proven sepsis were identified to be
		  the optimal input features. The MLP, employing 18 input
		  neurons and 12 hidden neurons, yielded high predictive
		  accuracy, with c-statistic of 0.91 (P<0.001) in one-year
		  and 0.88 (P<0.001) in two-year prediction. The performances
		  of SOFA and MELD were fairly poor in prognostic assessment,
		  with c-statistics of 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, in
		  one-year prediction, and 0.67 and 0.65 in two-year
		  prediction.The posttransplant prognosis is a
		  multidimensional nonlinear problem, and the MLP can achieve
		  significantly high accuracy than SOFA and MELD scores in
		  posttransplant survival prediction. The pattern recognition
		  methodologies like MLP hold promise for solving
		  posttransplant outcome prediction.},

		  would be almost twice as effective as postexposure vaccines
		  in reducing the number of new infections. Postexposure
		  vaccines would initially have a substantially greater
		  impact, compared to preexposure vaccines, on reducing the
		  number of new cases of disease. However, the effectiveness
		  of postexposure vaccines would diminish over time, whereas
		  the effectiveness of preexposure vaccines would increase.
		  Thus, after 20 to 30 years, post- or preexposure
		  vaccination campaigns would be almost equally effective in
		  terms of cumulative TB cases prevented. Even widely
