  abstract = {Gillespie's direct method (DM) [D. Gillespie, J. Chem. Phys. 81, 2340
	(1977)] for exact stochastic simulation of chemical reaction systems
	has been widely adopted. It is easy to implement but requires large
	computation for relatively large systems. Recently, two more efficient
	methods, next reaction method (NRM) [M. A. Gibson and J. Bruck, J.
	Phys. Chem. A 105, 1876 (2000)] and optimized DM (ODM) [Y. Cao et
	al., J. Chem. Phys. 121, 4059 (2004)], have been developed to improve
	simulation speed. It has been demonstrated that the ODM is the state-of-the-art
	most efficient method for exact stochastic simulation of most practical
	reaction systems. In this paper, we first develop an exact stochastic
	simulation algorithm named ODMK that is more efficient than the ODM.
	We then develop an approximate method named K-skip method to further
	accelerate simulation. Using two chemical reaction systems, we demonstrate
	that our ODMK and K-skip method can save 20\%-30\% and 70\%-80\%
	simulation time, respectively, comparing to the ODM. We also show
	that our ODMK and K-skip method provide almost the same simulation
	accuracy as the ODM.},

  abstract = {The enzyme-catalyzed conversion of a substrate into a product is a
	common reaction motif in cellular chemical systems. In the three
	reactions that comprise this process, the intermediate enzyme-substrate
	complex is usually much more likely to decay into its original constituents
	than to produce a product molecule. This condition makes the reaction
	set mathematically "stiff." We show here how the simulation of this
	stiff reaction set can be dramatically speeded up relative to the
	standard stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) by using a recently
	introduced procedure called the slow-scale SSA. The speedup occurs
	because the slow-scale SSA explicitly simulates only the relatively
	rare conversion reactions, skipping over occurrences of the other
	two less interesting but much more frequent reactions. We describe,
	explain, and illustrate this simulation procedure for the isolated
	enzyme-substrate reaction set, and then we show how the procedure
	extends to the more typical case in which the enzyme-substrate reactions
	occur together with other reactions and species. Finally, we explain
	the connection between this slow-scale SSA approach and the Michaelis-Menten
	[Biochem. Z. 49, 333 (1913)] formula, which has long been used in
	deterministic chemical kinetics to describe the enzyme-substrate
	reaction.},

  abstract = {The explicit tau-leaping procedure attempts to speed up the stochastic
	simulation of a chemically reacting system by approximating the number
	of firings of each reaction channel during a chosen time increment
	tau as a Poisson random variable. Since the Poisson random variable
	can have arbitrarily large sample values, there is always the possibility
	that this procedure will cause one or more reaction channels to fire
	so many times during tau that the population of some reactant species
	will be driven negative. Two recent papers have shown how that unacceptable
	occurrence can be avoided by replacing the Poisson random variables
	with binomial random variables, whose values are naturally bounded.
	This paper describes a modified Poisson tau-leaping procedure that
	also avoids negative populations, but is easier to implement than
	the binomial procedure. The new Poisson procedure also introduces
	a second control parameter, whose value essentially dials the procedure
	from the original Poisson tau-leaping at one extreme to the exact
	stochastic simulation algorithm at the other; therefore, the modified
	Poisson procedure will generally be more accurate than the original
	Poisson procedure.},

  abstract = {Reactions in real chemical systems often take place on vastly different
	time scales, with "fast" reaction channels firing very much more
	frequently than "slow" ones. These firings will be interdependent
	if, as is usually the case, the fast and slow reactions involve some
	of the same species. An exact stochastic simulation of such a system
	will necessarily spend most of its time simulating the more numerous
	fast reaction events. This is a frustratingly inefficient allocation
	of computational effort when dynamical stiffness is present, since
	in that case a fast reaction event will be of much less importance
	to the system's evolution than will a slow reaction event. For such
	situations, this paper develops a systematic approximate theory that
	allows one to stochastically advance the system in time by simulating
	the firings of only the slow reaction events. Developing an effective
	strategy to implement this theory poses some challenges, but as is
	illustrated here for two simple systems, when those challenges can
	be overcome, very substantial increases in simulation speed can be
	realized.},
